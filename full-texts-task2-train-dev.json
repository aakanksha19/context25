Polarization is maintained by restricting the pseudopod catalyst , active Rac , to the front . Here , we show that the actin nucleation - promoting factor Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein ( WASP ) contributes to maintenance of front - rear polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of active Rac . Dictyostelium cells lacking WASP inappropriately activate Rac at the rear , which affects their polarity and speed . WASP\u2019s Cdc42 and Rac interacting binding ( \u2018\u2018CRIB\u2019\u2019 ) motif has been thought to be essential for its activation . However , we show that the CRIB motif\u2019s biological role is unexpectedly complex . WASP CRIB mutants are no longer able to restrict Rac activity to the front , and cannot generate new pseudopods when SCAR / WAVE is absent . Overall levels of Rac activity also in - crease when WASP is unable to bind to Rac . How - ever , WASP without a functional CRIB domain local - izes normally at clathrin pits during endocytosis , and activates Arp2 / 3 complex . Similarly , chemical inhibi - tion of Rac does not affect WASP localization or acti - vation at sites of endocytosis . Thus , the interaction between small GTPases and WASP is more complex than previously thought\u2014Rac regulates a subset of WASP functions , but WASP reciprocally restricts active Rac through its CRIB motif . INTRODUCTION Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) ful\ufb01ls numerous functions in migrating cells . One crucial role is the generation of protrusions , such as pseudopods and lamellipods . A second is maintenance of intracellular traf\ufb01cking , by driving endocytosis and vesicle sorting . These diverse functions depend upon the highly conserved Arp2 / 3 complex , which drives branching and growth of the actin network [ 1 ] . Cells rely on the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family of nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) to control the Arp2 / 3 complex spatially and temporally . The founding member of the family , WASP [ 2 ] , is speci\ufb01c to hematopoietic lineages . Vertebrates possess a ubiquitous WASP paralog , N - WASP , which was originally described as a neural - speci\ufb01c gene [ 3 ] although expressed in nearly all cell types [ 4 ] . Other eukaryotes , including Dictyostelium , yeasts , and Drosophila , express a single WASP , which is the ortholog of vertebrates\u2019 ubiquitous isoform [ 5 ] . WASPs\u2019 principal role is to facilitate clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) [ 6 \u2013 9 ] . Other members of the WASP family recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to other structures and for other purposes . For instance , the SCAR / WAVE complex drives formation of actin - rich protrusions [ 10 \u2013 13 ] and is therefore an established regulator of cell migration and polarization . Protrusions and clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) tend to occur in different regions of the cell . Protrusions can be generated almost anywhere on the membrane , but those that cause loco - motion are usually initiated at the cell front , where SCAR / WAVE localizes . Whether CCPs are internalized in de\ufb01ned areas of the cell appears cell type dependent . In highly motile cells , including lymphocytes [ 14 ] , leukocytes [ 15 ] , and Dictyostelium [ 16 ] , CME tends to occur at the rear . WASP and SCAR / WAVE are normally spatially and function - ally segregated . Nevertheless , they are plastic . In Dictyostelium and Caenorhabditis , WASP can compensate for loss of SCAR / WAVE [ 12 , 17 ] , generating actin protrusions at the cell front . Thus , WASP can respond to the upstream signals that drive pseudopod extension but does not normally do so . What deter - mines segregation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE remains an impor - tant open question . One prediction is that upstream regulators are crucial\u2014 distinct sub - cellular localization of activators may account for WASP\u2019s and SCAR / WAVE\u2019s distinct sub - cellular distribution and function . However , some of the upstream regulators appear to be shared between WASPs and SCAR / WAVE , for example , Nck [ 18 , 19 ] . Small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) are also known crucial activators of both WASPs and SCAR / WAVE . However , while SCAR / WAVE has consistently been linked to Rac1 [ 20 \u2013 22 ] , there is no coherent model of how WASPs\u2019 behavior is regulated by small guanosine triphospha - tases ( GTPases ) .

WASPs from most organisms contain a \u2018\u2018CRIB\u2019\u2019 ( Cdc42 / Rac interacting binding ) motif , which binds selectively and specif - ically to the active form of Rac and Cdc42 [ 23 ] in many different proteins [ 23 , 24 ] . Early in vitro measurements concluded that Cdc42 had a major role in activating N - WASP [ 4 , 25 ] . However , more recent and precise biochemical analysis suggests that Cdc42 activates hematopoietic WASP , while Rac1 also interacts with N - WASP [ 26 ] . For Dictyostelium WASP , most attention has focused on the unusual RacC [ 27 ] , although WASP also ef\ufb01 - ciently interacts with members of the Rac1 subfamily [ 27 ] , which are more abundant ( http : / / dictyexpress . biolab . si ) and more closely related to mammalian Cdc42 and Racs . The Dictyoste - lium genome contains genes for many Rac relatives but no Cdc42 [ 28 ] . Understanding spatial and functional segregation of WASPs and SCAR / WAVE requires an improved comprehension of in - teractions with small GTPases . In fact , a model whereby Rac mediates the activation of both NPFs \ufb01ts poorly with their distinct sub - cellular localization and functionality . Recent work offers a fresh perspective on how cells maintain spatial and functional separation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE [ 6 ] . Loss of WASP in Dictyostelium causes aberrant accumula - tion of SCAR / WAVE at the rear , leading to defective retraction [ 6 ] and compromised cell polarity . Here , we dissect the role for WASP in maintenance of front - rear polarization . We demonstrate that WASP exploits its CRIB - mediated interaction with active Rac to limit where the active GTPase is found . Furthermore , this work clari\ufb01es the importance of GTPases for WASP\u2019s function : a direct interaction with active GTPases is not needed for WASP to trigger actin polymerization during CME , but is required for WASP to generate pseudopods in SCAR / WAVE\u2019s absence . More provocatively , our study sug - gests a reversed role for the interaction between WASP and GTPases : the presence of a CRIB motif does not only mean that WASP activity requires GTPase regulation , but that WASP modulates the distribution of GTPases after they are activated . RESULTS Loss of WASP Causes Accumulation of SCAR / WAVE and Active Rac at the Rear Previous work shows that knockout mutants in the Dictyostelium gene encoding WASP , wasA , migrate slower than their wild - type counterparts , due to a defect in rear retraction [ 6 ] . Detailed analysis revealed that , although wild - type cells con\ufb01ne SCAR / WAVE at the extending protrusions ( Figure 1A ) , wasA (cid:1) cells also accumulate it within an enlarged rear ( Figure 1B ) . Mutants fail to con\ufb01ne SCAR / WAVE to a single region of their plasma membrane , resulting in a nearly bipolar appearance . Here , we examined the drivers of wasA (cid:1) cells\u2019 inability to exclude SCAR / WAVE from their rear . One intriguing possibility was that WASP may be responsible for the spatial restriction of SCAR / WAVE\u2019s activators , preventing actin polymerization in unwanted areas of the cell . Because active Rac is one of the major SCAR / WAVE regulators [ 20 , 21 , 29 ] , we asked whether localization or dynamics of the GTP - bound GTPase was affected in wasA (cid:1) cells . We imaged living cells expressing \ufb02uorescently tagged CRIB motif of PakB , which binds to many Dictyostelium Racs , including Rac1A - C and RacC , with high - af\ufb01nity in vitro [ 30 ] and is thus an effective re - porter for active Rac [ 12 ] . Similar constructs have been used to monitor endogenous active Rac in mammalian cells [ 31 \u2013 33 ] . As expected , wild - type cells accumulate active Rac at the lead - ing edge ( Figures 1C and S1A ) , where it co - localizes with F - actin . wasA (cid:1) cells also accumulate active Rac at the enlarged rear ( Figures 1D and S1B ; Video S1 ) , leading to the formation of F - actin - rich structures at both ends . Quanti\ufb01cation revealed that , although wild - type cells occasionally show active Rac at the rear , mostly when pseudopods are swept from the front of the cell as it moves , wasA (cid:1) cells more frequently accumulate active Rac at their backs ( Figure 1E ) . Because the localization of both active Rac and SCAR / WAVE is aberrant in wasA (cid:1) cells and Rac directly regulates SCAR / WAVE , the simplest conclusion would be that WASP limits the amount of membrane with active Rac . Generation of WASP CRIB Mutants We tested possible molecular mechanisms underlying WASP - mediated con\ufb01nement of active Rac and SCAR / WAVE . We focused on WASP\u2019s CRIB motif , which enables WASP to bind active GTPases , by introducing mutations ( Figure 2A ) . The \ufb01rst mutant , WASP D CRIB , harbors a deletion of 14 residues ( 173 \u2013 186 ) of the CRIB\u2019s core [ 23 ] . A related mutant has been described in Drosophila [ 34 ] . To ensure this substantial deletion did not affect function , we designed a second mutant ( WASP * * CRIB ) , containing only two conservative amino acidic changes ( I173A ; F179A ) , chosen for their position in the WASP / Rac interface ( Figure 2B ) , inferred from the structure of the complex between Cdc42 and WASP\u2019s minimal p21 binding domain , which includes the CRIB motif [ 35 ] . Changing them to alternative hydrophobic amino acids should maximally diminish the binding energy , with minimal change to the CRIB motif\u2019s structure . Importantly , both changes affect the N terminus of the CRIB motif , which is not primarily involved in maintenance of the autoinhibited conformation [ 36 ] . We therefore do not expect these mutations to steer WASP to an inappropriately active conformation . We tested the two WASP CRIB mutants\u2019 interaction with active Rac using pull - down assays . We examined Rac1A , highly expressed and closely related to canonical Rac1 of other spe - cies , and RacC , which has been associated with Dictyostelium WASP [ 27 ] . Bacterially puri\ufb01ed glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - Racs were activated by loading with GTP g s , a non - hydro - lyzable analog of GTP . Wild - type WASP binds to active Racs , but neither CRIB mutant is able to bind either GTPase ( Figures 2C , 2D , and S2 ) . Rac Binding Is Not Required to Recruit WASP to CCPs The most widely accepted model of WASP regulation asserts that Rac or Cdc42 have an essential role in controlling WASP\u2019s activity [ 4 , 25 \u2013 27 ] , implying WASP mutants that cannot interact with active Rac should lose function . To test which physiological functions of WASP depend on Rac regulation and a functional CRIB domain , we imaged wasA (cid:1) cells co - expressing \ufb02uores - cently tagged WASP mutants and clathrin . As shown in Figures 3A and 3B , wild - type WASP generates puncta that overlap with CCPs . At any time , the number of cla - thrin puncta that are WASP positive is low ; this is because 4170 Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 WASP appears in a brief burst while CCPs persist on the plasma membrane for a longer period of time . Figure 3C shows a repre - sentative example of clathrin / WASP dynamics visualized using TIRF ( total internal re\ufb02ection \ufb02uorescence ) microscopy of cells gently compressed under agarose , which diminishes front - rear polarity . WASP is recruited on a pre - existing CCP , where it sits for a few seconds before disappearing along with clathrin . Clear - ance of WASP and clathrin from the TIRF \ufb01eld is considered as a bona \ufb01de sign of CCP internalization [ 37 ] . To our surprise , both WASP CRIB mutants generate puncta that coincide with CCPs ( Figures 3D , 3E , 3G , and 3H ) . Live TIRF imaging con\ufb01rmed that WASP D CRIB and WASP * * CRIB are recruited to pre - existing cla - thrin puncta ( Figures 3F and 3I ) . This clearly demonstrates that a direct interaction with active Rac is not required for WASP to be recruited to CCPs , suggest - ing that factors other than GTPases control WASP\u2019s sub - cellular localization in living cells during endocytosis . WASP Does Not Require Rac to Recruit Arp2 / 3 Complex and Actin We noticed that the WASP CRIB mutants co - localize with cla - thrin for longer than wild - type WASP .

Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 4171 their inability to trigger actin polymerization on CCPs , as F - actin is thought to provide the force required for CME [ 38 , 39 ] and is mandatory in yeast and Dictyostelium [ 6 , 40 ] , but not all mammalian cells [ 41 , 42 ] . Given our demonstration that loss of WASP causes increased CCP lifetime due to the lack of actin ( Figure 2E in [ 6 ] ) , we tested whether WASP CRIB mutants are able to trigger actin polymerization once recruited to CCPs . In essentially 100 % of cases , WASP spots ( which tend to be distributed over the rear half of polarized cells ) are Arp2 / 3 complex positive , presumably re\ufb02ecting the fact that WASP is activated as it is targeted to CCPs , so the Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited synchronously ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Unexpectedly , 100 % of puncta generated by mutated WASPs are also Arp2 / 3 complex positive ( Figures 4C \u2013 4F ) . Spots generated by WASP D CRIB and WASP * * CRIB were more likely to be seen within the enlarged rear of the cell , with increased lifetimes ( Figure 4G ) . Consistent with the Arp2 / 3 complex data , F - actin was observed on all WASP puncta irrespective of the presence of a functional CRIB domain ( Figure 4H ; Video S2 ) . WASP\u2019s ability to drive actin polymerization at CCPs is therefore independent of small GTPase binding .

NSC23766 [ 43 ] failed to show any effect ( not shown ) . However , EHT1864 , which blocks Rac\u2019s loading with GTP in mammalian cells [ 44 , 45 ] , was very effective in Dictyoste - lium ( Figure S3A ) . A minimal dose of 3 m M causes rapid loss of membrane localization of the active Rac marker , leading to progressive cell rounding . In agreement with our data highlighting the ability of CRIB - mutated WASP to be recruited to CCPs , we found that WASP is able to generate Arp2 / 3 - complex - and F - actin - positive puncta after Rac inhibition ( Figures 4I , S3B , and S3C ) . Quantitative analysis ( Figures S3D and S3E ) shows that EHT1864 does not alter the rate at which WASP puncta are generated or their lifetime . This result reinforces our conclu - sion that WASP does not need active GTPases to localize correctly during CME or to recruit Arp2 / 3 complex and generate F - actin . WASP Interaction with Active Rac Is Essential for Front - Rear Polarity The generation of WASP CRIB mutants allowed us to test whether WASP requires a direct interaction with active Rac to maintain front - rear polarization . wasA (cid:1) cells accumulate active Rac at the leading edge , but also within the enlarged rear ( Figures 5A and 1D ) . wasA (cid:1) cells expressing GFP - tagged WASP ( rescue ) behave normally , accu - mulating active Rac exclusively at the front ( Figure 5B ) . CRIB - mutated WASPs do not suppress the accumulation of active Rac at the rear\u2014both mutants generate discrete puncta that accumulate within the enlarged rear , together with persistent active Rac - marker - positive structures like those seen in unre - scued wasA (cid:1) cells ( Figures 5C and 5D ; Video S3 ) . At a given time , a subset of puncta in WASP CRIB mutants is also enriched 4172 Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 C l a t h r i n G H E D W A SP \u0394 CR I B B A W A SP C l a t h r i n W A SP * * CR I B W A SP C - 5 s - 10 s 15 s 20 s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 10 s - 15 s 30 s 25 s C l a t h r i n C l a t h r i n wasA - , WASP , Clathrin wasA - , WASP \u0394CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP , Clathrin wasA - , WASP \u0394CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP * * CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP * * CRIB , Clathrin F 0 s - 5 s - 10 s - 15 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 10 s 15 s 20 s 25 s 30 s C l a t h r i n W A SP \u0394 CR I B 30 s - 5 s - 10 s - 15 s 1 s 3 s 0 s 2 s 4 s 5 s 10 s 15 s 20 s 25 s C l a t h r i n I W A S P * * C R I B Figure 3 .

( legend continued on next page ) Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 4173 in active Rac . WASP - CRIB - mutants and active Rac appear to have distinct dynamics : active Rac appears to remain at the plasma membrane for longer than CRIB - mutated WASPs . Therefore , although some active Rac - positive structures are not enriched in CRIB - mutated WASPs , we cannot exclude that they were enriched in CRIB - mutated WASP at some stage . Representative plots showing active Rac marker localization from front to rear are shown in Figure 5E . Quanti\ufb01cation ( Figure 5F ) reveals that cells expressing CRIB - mutated WASPs accumulate active Rac at the rear to the same degree as wasA (cid:1) cells , while wild - type WASP rescues the spatial con\ufb01nement of active Rac at the leading edge . In line with previ - ous reports from wasA (cid:1) cells [ 6 ] , cells expressing either WASP CRIB mutant are signi\ufb01cantly slower than those expressing wild - type WASP ( Figure 5G ) . Our results show that WASP requires an intact CRIB motif to exclude active Rac from the cell rear during migration . WASP Contributes to Homeostasis of Active Rac Levels We examined whether WASP works locally , to remove active Rac from inappropriate locations , or has a more global role in Rac regulation . Taking into account that active Rac is largely membrane bound [ 46 ] , and that the CRIB - based marker interacts selectively with GTP - bound Rac [ 30 ] but is cytosolic when unbound , then the ratio of active Rac marker at the membrane and in the cytosol offers a measure of the total levels of active Rac in the cell [ 12 ] . We therefore measured the relative quantities of active Rac marker at the membrane and within the cytosol in cells express - ing CRIB - mutated WASPs . As shown in Figure 6A ( quanti\ufb01ed in Figure 6B ) , the membrane : cytosol ratio of the active Rac marker is consistently and signi\ufb01cantly higher in cells expressing a CRIB - mutated WASP in comparison with cells expressing wild - type WASP . We con\ufb01rmed this result by pulling down the active Rac from cell lysates using GST - CRIB beads ( Figure 6C ) . Again , we observed a higher level of active Rac in cell expressing WASP CRIB mutants . We also examined the extent of active Rac patches . Cells ex - pressing CRIB - mutated WASPs accumulate the active Rac marker in a signi\ufb01cantly larger portion of their plasma membrane than cells expressing wild - type WASP ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . This increase in active Rac localization is accompanied by a reduc - tion in cell polarity ( Figure 6F ) . Cells expressing wild - type WASP are elongated even when migrating randomly , while those expressing either WASP CRIB mutant are more rounded , with a length : width ratio of nearly one . No signi\ufb01cant difference be - tween the average perimeter of cells expressing wild - type or CRIB - mutated WASPs was seen ( Figure 6G ) , so the more widespread localization of the active Rac marker in cells ex - pressing WASP CRIB mutants is not due to the availability of more plasma membrane . We con\ufb01rmed the correlation between active Rac levels and the proportion of plasma membrane labeled by the active Rac marker using tetracycline - inducible dominant - active ( G12V ) Rac1A . Induction with tetracycline causes cells to accumulate the active Rac marker on a higher proportion of the plasma membrane , often close to 100 % ( Fig - ures S4A and S4B ) . Altogether , our data show that cells whose WASP lacks a functional CRIB motif , and thus cannot bind Rac , accumulate more active Rac on a higher portion of the plasma membrane than cells with an intact WASP . WASP Requires Active Rac Interaction to Replace SCAR / WAVE at Pseudopods Internalization of CCPs is by far the clearest and evolutionarily conserved role of WASP ; however , WASP can contextually ful\ufb01l other biological roles . For instance , WASP can drive protrusion extension in cells that have lost SCAR / WAVE [ 12 ] . We therefore asked whether WASP can drive pseudopods extension inde - pendently of Rac1 , using a cell line in which wasA is knocked out and SCAR expressed under a tetracycline - inducible pro - moter ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet ) . We expressed CRIB - mutated GFP - WASP in wasA (cid:1) scrA tet cells and examined their ability to migrate toward chemoattractant in the presence of tetracy - cline ( when SCAR / WAVE is expressed ) or without ( when the only pseudopod inducer was the exogenously expressed WASP ) . As shown in Figure 7A , cells expressing SCAR / WAVE and wild - type WASP ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / ON / GFP - WASP ) migrate ef\ufb01 - ciently in a chemotactic gradient . In these cells , WASP localizes to F - actin - rich puncta . Once the expression of SCAR / WAVE is turned off ( Figure 7B ) , cells expressing wild - type WASP ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP ) are still able to move effectively . In these cells , WASP is additionally localized to the leading edge , where it drives formation of pseudopods , as previously described [ 12 ] .

In each case , the mutated WASPs localize to puncta clustered within the enlarged rear . When expression of SCAR / WAVE is turned off , cells expressing either WASP CRIB mutant lose the ability to move , highly resembling cells lacking SCAR and WASP [ 6 ] ( Figures 7D and 7F ; wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP D CRIB and wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP * * CRIB , respectively ) . Under these circumstances , pseudo - pods are no longer generated but replaced by inef\ufb01cient spiky protrusions , which cannot translocate the cell . Thus , a functional CRIB motif\u2014and therefore a direct activa - tion by Rac\u2014is essential for WASP to stimulate pseudopod for - mation in the absence of SCAR / WAVE . DISCUSSION WASP\u2019s Interaction with Small GTPases : Implications for WASP Regulation Considering how important actin nucleation promoting factors are , for processes as diverse as cell movement [ 10 \u2013 12 ] , macro - pinocytosis [ 47 ] , vesicular sorting [ 48 , 49 ] , mitosis [ 50 ] , meiosis [ 51 ] , and DNA repair [ 52 ] , their control is exceptionally poorly un - derstood . The SCAR / WAVE complex contains \ufb01ve proteins [ 21 ] and harbors multiple potential phosphorylation and protein - pro - tein interaction sites [ 53 ] , but the relevance of most is largely un - known . WASPs , the family that includes mammalian WASP and N - WASP , the singular Dictyostelium and Drosophila WASP , were thought to be an exception . Largely based on biochemical data , the interaction with active GTPases ( Cdc42 or Rac ) has long been considered essential for WASP activation . Other factors , such as PIP 2 and adaptor proteins , may contribute to the NPFs activation [ 3 , 4 , 25 , 26 , 54 \u2013 56 ] . But in vitro settings do not reca - pitulate the complexity of a living cell , and early data implying a key role for small GTPases in WASP activation have not been corroborated in living cells . Studies in Drosophila suggest that CRIB - mutated WASP can still ful\ufb01l its developmental roles [ 34 ] , and a CRIB - deleted N - WASP still triggers actin comet tails formation in PIP5K - overexpressing cultured \ufb01broblasts [ 57 ] . Evolutionary arguments point in the same direction : yeasts\u2019 WASPs have lost their Rac - binding CRIB motif during evolution but facilitate CME by a remarkably similar mechanism to higher eukaryotes\u2019 WASPs [ 8 ] . Inotherwords , althoughanumberofreviewsdescribeGTPase binding as an essential step toward WASP localization and acti - vation [ 58 , 59 ] , ourunderstanding ofthis interaction\u2019s importance to living cells is still poor . Our work adds to this complex jigsaw . Byintroducing adeletionwithin theWASP CRIB motif or\u2014impor - tantly\u2014a \ufb01ner mutation that abrogates interaction with Rac using only two conservative substitutions , we show that WASP does not rely on GTPases to localize to CCPs nor to induce Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymerization once there . WASP\u2019s Role in Front - Rear Polarity If WASP does not need GTPases to localize to CCPs or to trigger actin polymerization on puncta , why does it interact with them ? CRIB motifs are the best - understood GTPase interactors , with high speci\ufb01city for the active forms of Rac and Cdc42 [ 23 ] . Dic - tyostelium lacks a Cdc42 [ 28 ] , which \ufb01rst appears just before fungal and metazoan evolutionary lineages divide , but its WASP has a well - conserved CRIB motif that gives strong binding speci\ufb01city to active Rac1A and C [ 27 ] . What are its physiological roles ? We provide two related answers . First , WASP needs a direct interaction with active Rac to compensate for loss of SCAR / WAVE . WASPs are not normally involved in pseudopod forma - tion [ 60 ] but take over when SCAR / WAVE is absent [ 17 ] . Because active Rac is the key speci\ufb01er of the leading edge , it is unsurpris - ing that WASP requires Rac binding to do so . ThesecondroleforRacbindingtoWASPismoresubtle . WASP exploits its CRIB motif to prevent aberrant accumulation of the GTPaseatthecellrear . WhenthereisnoWASP , cellslosepolarity in an idiosyncratic way\u2014they generate pseudopods at the front but also carry a substantial , complex assembly at the rear that slows and depolarizes them . This aggregate contains active Rac and therefore continuously recruits SCAR / WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complex , inducing actin polymerization . This raises two main Figure 4 .

It highlights our poor understanding of the uro - pod , which may simplistically be seen as a black hole where un - necessary migratory components are passively drawn , and it un - derscoresourincompleteknowledge ofhowcellsachievespatial and functional segregation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE . We propose a novel role for WASP as a homeostatic regulator of active Rac . We envision a model whereby WASP at CCPs , in addition to triggering Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymeri - zation , also removes active Rac from the membrane through its CRIB motif . In wild - type cells , we cannot detect the \ufb02uorescent active Rac marker at endocytic puncta , primarily for two rea - sons . First , active Rac that is recruited to a CCP is WASP bound , and thus unable to also bind our active Rac marker ; second , the high membrane background masks the few active Rac mole - cules that , we predict , are recruited by each CCP . WASP - medi - ated clearance of active Rac will obviously occur faster when GTPases are excessively activated , and slower when there is lit - tle GTPase activation , so cellular levels of active Rac are main - tained . Spatially , given that CME occurs mostly at the rear of migrating cells , active Rac will be removed faster there . Thus , WASP will ensure that active Rac is removed from the cell rear , maintaining front - rear polarity . Our proposed role of WASP does not exclude other models of cell polarity . Rather , WASP - mediated clearance of active Rac may collaborate with other mechanisms underpinning spatial con\ufb01nement of active Rac , such as membrane tension [ 61 ] , in maintaining a dominant front . WASP and CRIB Motifs : \u2018\u2018The Cowl Does Not Make the Monk\u2019\u2019 When WASP was \ufb01rst discovered , the presence of a CRIB motif led researchers to conclude that its activity was dependent on GTPases [ 3 ] . This now seems an oversimpli\ufb01cation . We have shown here that WASP does not rely on the availability of ( nor on the interaction with ) active Rac to recruit Arp2 / 3 complex , or drive actin polymerization , during CME .

Therefore , WASP\u2019s requirement for active Rac appears to be context dependent , not an absolute requirement as initially thought . In the broader context , this means that inhibiting Rac may not of itself compromise WASP functionality . WASP has many physiological roles ( e . g . , invadopodia forma - tion ) , and its CRIB motif is likely to be important for a subset of other processes that we have not explored .

Protein puri\ufb01cation E . coli BL21 cells were transformed with a pGEXRac1A - encoding vector by heat - shock at 42 (cid:3) C , and plated overnight on ampicillin - containing SM plates . One colony was transferred to a tube containing LB medium ( 1 % Bacto - tryptone , 0 . 5 % Bacto - yeast extract , 17 mM NaCl , pH 7 ) plus ampicillin , and kept in shaking condition ( 200 rpm ) at 37 (cid:3) C until it reached the OD 600 of 2 . The bacterial sus - pension was then transferred in a larger volume of LB medium plus ampicillin , and kept overnight in shaking conditions ( 100 rpm ) at room temperature . Once the bacterial suspension reached the OD 600 of 0 . 4 , 500 m M IPTG ( Isopropyl b - D - 1 thiogalactopyranoside ) was added to yield the expression of GST - Rac1A , and bacteria were kept overnight in shaking conditions ( 100 rpm ) at room temper - ature .

Polarization is maintained by restricting the pseudopod catalyst , active Rac , to the front . Here , we show that the actin nucleation - promoting factor Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein ( WASP ) contributes to maintenance of front - rear polarity by controlling localization and cellular levels of active Rac . Dictyostelium cells lacking WASP inappropriately activate Rac at the rear , which affects their polarity and speed . WASP\u2019s Cdc42 and Rac interacting binding ( \u2018\u2018CRIB\u2019\u2019 ) motif has been thought to be essential for its activation . However , we show that the CRIB motif\u2019s biological role is unexpectedly complex . WASP CRIB mutants are no longer able to restrict Rac activity to the front , and cannot generate new pseudopods when SCAR / WAVE is absent . Overall levels of Rac activity also in - crease when WASP is unable to bind to Rac . How - ever , WASP without a functional CRIB domain local - izes normally at clathrin pits during endocytosis , and activates Arp2 / 3 complex . Similarly , chemical inhibi - tion of Rac does not affect WASP localization or acti - vation at sites of endocytosis . Thus , the interaction between small GTPases and WASP is more complex than previously thought\u2014Rac regulates a subset of WASP functions , but WASP reciprocally restricts active Rac through its CRIB motif . INTRODUCTION Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) ful\ufb01ls numerous functions in migrating cells . One crucial role is the generation of protrusions , such as pseudopods and lamellipods . A second is maintenance of intracellular traf\ufb01cking , by driving endocytosis and vesicle sorting . These diverse functions depend upon the highly conserved Arp2 / 3 complex , which drives branching and growth of the actin network [ 1 ] . Cells rely on the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family of nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) to control the Arp2 / 3 complex spatially and temporally . The founding member of the family , WASP [ 2 ] , is speci\ufb01c to hematopoietic lineages . Vertebrates possess a ubiquitous WASP paralog , N - WASP , which was originally described as a neural - speci\ufb01c gene [ 3 ] although expressed in nearly all cell types [ 4 ] . Other eukaryotes , including Dictyostelium , yeasts , and Drosophila , express a single WASP , which is the ortholog of vertebrates\u2019 ubiquitous isoform [ 5 ] . WASPs\u2019 principal role is to facilitate clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) [ 6 \u2013 9 ] . Other members of the WASP family recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to other structures and for other purposes . For instance , the SCAR / WAVE complex drives formation of actin - rich protrusions [ 10 \u2013 13 ] and is therefore an established regulator of cell migration and polarization . Protrusions and clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) tend to occur in different regions of the cell . Protrusions can be generated almost anywhere on the membrane , but those that cause loco - motion are usually initiated at the cell front , where SCAR / WAVE localizes . Whether CCPs are internalized in de\ufb01ned areas of the cell appears cell type dependent . In highly motile cells , including lymphocytes [ 14 ] , leukocytes [ 15 ] , and Dictyostelium [ 16 ] , CME tends to occur at the rear . WASP and SCAR / WAVE are normally spatially and function - ally segregated . Nevertheless , they are plastic . In Dictyostelium and Caenorhabditis , WASP can compensate for loss of SCAR / WAVE [ 12 , 17 ] , generating actin protrusions at the cell front . Thus , WASP can respond to the upstream signals that drive pseudopod extension but does not normally do so . What deter - mines segregation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE remains an impor - tant open question . One prediction is that upstream regulators are crucial\u2014 distinct sub - cellular localization of activators may account for WASP\u2019s and SCAR / WAVE\u2019s distinct sub - cellular distribution and function . However , some of the upstream regulators appear to be shared between WASPs and SCAR / WAVE , for example , Nck [ 18 , 19 ] . Small guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) are also known crucial activators of both WASPs and SCAR / WAVE . However , while SCAR / WAVE has consistently been linked to Rac1 [ 20 \u2013 22 ] , there is no coherent model of how WASPs\u2019 behavior is regulated by small guanosine triphospha - tases ( GTPases ) . Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 \u00aa 2019 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd . 4169 This is an open access article under the CC BY license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) . WASPs from most organisms contain a \u2018\u2018CRIB\u2019\u2019 ( Cdc42 / Rac interacting binding ) motif , which binds selectively and specif - ically to the active form of Rac and Cdc42 [ 23 ] in many different proteins [ 23 , 24 ] . Early in vitro measurements concluded that Cdc42 had a major role in activating N - WASP [ 4 , 25 ] . However , more recent and precise biochemical analysis suggests that Cdc42 activates hematopoietic WASP , while Rac1 also interacts with N - WASP [ 26 ] . For Dictyostelium WASP , most attention has focused on the unusual RacC [ 27 ] , although WASP also ef\ufb01 - ciently interacts with members of the Rac1 subfamily [ 27 ] , which are more abundant ( http : / / dictyexpress . biolab . si ) and more closely related to mammalian Cdc42 and Racs . The Dictyoste - lium genome contains genes for many Rac relatives but no Cdc42 [ 28 ] . Understanding spatial and functional segregation of WASPs and SCAR / WAVE requires an improved comprehension of in - teractions with small GTPases . In fact , a model whereby Rac mediates the activation of both NPFs \ufb01ts poorly with their distinct sub - cellular localization and functionality . Recent work offers a fresh perspective on how cells maintain spatial and functional separation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE [ 6 ] . Loss of WASP in Dictyostelium causes aberrant accumula - tion of SCAR / WAVE at the rear , leading to defective retraction [ 6 ] and compromised cell polarity . Here , we dissect the role for WASP in maintenance of front - rear polarization . We demonstrate that WASP exploits its CRIB - mediated interaction with active Rac to limit where the active GTPase is found . Furthermore , this work clari\ufb01es the importance of GTPases for WASP\u2019s function : a direct interaction with active GTPases is not needed for WASP to trigger actin polymerization during CME , but is required for WASP to generate pseudopods in SCAR / WAVE\u2019s absence . More provocatively , our study sug - gests a reversed role for the interaction between WASP and GTPases : the presence of a CRIB motif does not only mean that WASP activity requires GTPase regulation , but that WASP modulates the distribution of GTPases after they are activated . RESULTS Loss of WASP Causes Accumulation of SCAR / WAVE and Active Rac at the Rear Previous work shows that knockout mutants in the Dictyostelium gene encoding WASP , wasA , migrate slower than their wild - type counterparts , due to a defect in rear retraction [ 6 ] . Detailed analysis revealed that , although wild - type cells con\ufb01ne SCAR / WAVE at the extending protrusions ( Figure 1A ) , wasA (cid:1) cells also accumulate it within an enlarged rear ( Figure 1B ) . Mutants fail to con\ufb01ne SCAR / WAVE to a single region of their plasma membrane , resulting in a nearly bipolar appearance . Here , we examined the drivers of wasA (cid:1) cells\u2019 inability to exclude SCAR / WAVE from their rear . One intriguing possibility was that WASP may be responsible for the spatial restriction of SCAR / WAVE\u2019s activators , preventing actin polymerization in unwanted areas of the cell . Because active Rac is one of the major SCAR / WAVE regulators [ 20 , 21 , 29 ] , we asked whether localization or dynamics of the GTP - bound GTPase was affected in wasA (cid:1) cells . We imaged living cells expressing \ufb02uorescently tagged CRIB motif of PakB , which binds to many Dictyostelium Racs , including Rac1A - C and RacC , with high - af\ufb01nity in vitro [ 30 ] and is thus an effective re - porter for active Rac [ 12 ] . Similar constructs have been used to monitor endogenous active Rac in mammalian cells [ 31 \u2013 33 ] . As expected , wild - type cells accumulate active Rac at the lead - ing edge ( Figures 1C and S1A ) , where it co - localizes with F - actin . wasA (cid:1) cells also accumulate active Rac at the enlarged rear ( Figures 1D and S1B ; Video S1 ) , leading to the formation of F - actin - rich structures at both ends . Quanti\ufb01cation revealed that , although wild - type cells occasionally show active Rac at the rear , mostly when pseudopods are swept from the front of the cell as it moves , wasA (cid:1) cells more frequently accumulate active Rac at their backs ( Figure 1E ) . Because the localization of both active Rac and SCAR / WAVE is aberrant in wasA (cid:1) cells and Rac directly regulates SCAR / WAVE , the simplest conclusion would be that WASP limits the amount of membrane with active Rac . Generation of WASP CRIB Mutants We tested possible molecular mechanisms underlying WASP - mediated con\ufb01nement of active Rac and SCAR / WAVE . We focused on WASP\u2019s CRIB motif , which enables WASP to bind active GTPases , by introducing mutations ( Figure 2A ) . The \ufb01rst mutant , WASP D CRIB , harbors a deletion of 14 residues ( 173 \u2013 186 ) of the CRIB\u2019s core [ 23 ] . A related mutant has been described in Drosophila [ 34 ] . To ensure this substantial deletion did not affect function , we designed a second mutant ( WASP * * CRIB ) , containing only two conservative amino acidic changes ( I173A ; F179A ) , chosen for their position in the WASP / Rac interface ( Figure 2B ) , inferred from the structure of the complex between Cdc42 and WASP\u2019s minimal p21 binding domain , which includes the CRIB motif [ 35 ] . Changing them to alternative hydrophobic amino acids should maximally diminish the binding energy , with minimal change to the CRIB motif\u2019s structure . Importantly , both changes affect the N terminus of the CRIB motif , which is not primarily involved in maintenance of the autoinhibited conformation [ 36 ] . We therefore do not expect these mutations to steer WASP to an inappropriately active conformation . We tested the two WASP CRIB mutants\u2019 interaction with active Rac using pull - down assays . We examined Rac1A , highly expressed and closely related to canonical Rac1 of other spe - cies , and RacC , which has been associated with Dictyostelium WASP [ 27 ] . Bacterially puri\ufb01ed glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - Racs were activated by loading with GTP g s , a non - hydro - lyzable analog of GTP . Wild - type WASP binds to active Racs , but neither CRIB mutant is able to bind either GTPase ( Figures 2C , 2D , and S2 ) . Rac Binding Is Not Required to Recruit WASP to CCPs The most widely accepted model of WASP regulation asserts that Rac or Cdc42 have an essential role in controlling WASP\u2019s activity [ 4 , 25 \u2013 27 ] , implying WASP mutants that cannot interact with active Rac should lose function . To test which physiological functions of WASP depend on Rac regulation and a functional CRIB domain , we imaged wasA (cid:1) cells co - expressing \ufb02uores - cently tagged WASP mutants and clathrin . As shown in Figures 3A and 3B , wild - type WASP generates puncta that overlap with CCPs . At any time , the number of cla - thrin puncta that are WASP positive is low ; this is because 4170 Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 WASP appears in a brief burst while CCPs persist on the plasma membrane for a longer period of time . Figure 3C shows a repre - sentative example of clathrin / WASP dynamics visualized using TIRF ( total internal re\ufb02ection \ufb02uorescence ) microscopy of cells gently compressed under agarose , which diminishes front - rear polarity . WASP is recruited on a pre - existing CCP , where it sits for a few seconds before disappearing along with clathrin . Clear - ance of WASP and clathrin from the TIRF \ufb01eld is considered as a bona \ufb01de sign of CCP internalization [ 37 ] . To our surprise , both WASP CRIB mutants generate puncta that coincide with CCPs ( Figures 3D , 3E , 3G , and 3H ) . Live TIRF imaging con\ufb01rmed that WASP D CRIB and WASP * * CRIB are recruited to pre - existing cla - thrin puncta ( Figures 3F and 3I ) . This clearly demonstrates that a direct interaction with active Rac is not required for WASP to be recruited to CCPs , suggest - ing that factors other than GTPases control WASP\u2019s sub - cellular localization in living cells during endocytosis . WASP Does Not Require Rac to Recruit Arp2 / 3 Complex and Actin We noticed that the WASP CRIB mutants co - localize with cla - thrin for longer than wild - type WASP .

Given our demonstration that loss of WASP causes increased CCP lifetime due to the lack of actin ( Figure 2E in [ 6 ] ) , we tested whether WASP CRIB mutants are able to trigger actin polymerization once recruited to CCPs . In essentially 100 % of cases , WASP spots ( which tend to be distributed over the rear half of polarized cells ) are Arp2 / 3 complex positive , presumably re\ufb02ecting the fact that WASP is activated as it is targeted to CCPs , so the Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited synchronously ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Unexpectedly , 100 % of puncta generated by mutated WASPs are also Arp2 / 3 complex positive ( Figures 4C \u2013 4F ) . Spots generated by WASP D CRIB and WASP * * CRIB were more likely to be seen within the enlarged rear of the cell , with increased lifetimes ( Figure 4G ) . Consistent with the Arp2 / 3 complex data , F - actin was observed on all WASP puncta irrespective of the presence of a functional CRIB domain ( Figure 4H ; Video S2 ) . WASP\u2019s ability to drive actin polymerization at CCPs is therefore independent of small GTPase binding .

NSC23766 [ 43 ] failed to show any effect ( not shown ) . However , EHT1864 , which blocks Rac\u2019s loading with GTP in mammalian cells [ 44 , 45 ] , was very effective in Dictyoste - lium ( Figure S3A ) . A minimal dose of 3 m M causes rapid loss of membrane localization of the active Rac marker , leading to progressive cell rounding . In agreement with our data highlighting the ability of CRIB - mutated WASP to be recruited to CCPs , we found that WASP is able to generate Arp2 / 3 - complex - and F - actin - positive puncta after Rac inhibition ( Figures 4I , S3B , and S3C ) . Quantitative analysis ( Figures S3D and S3E ) shows that EHT1864 does not alter the rate at which WASP puncta are generated or their lifetime . This result reinforces our conclu - sion that WASP does not need active GTPases to localize correctly during CME or to recruit Arp2 / 3 complex and generate F - actin . WASP Interaction with Active Rac Is Essential for Front - Rear Polarity The generation of WASP CRIB mutants allowed us to test whether WASP requires a direct interaction with active Rac to maintain front - rear polarization . wasA (cid:1) cells accumulate active Rac at the leading edge , but also within the enlarged rear ( Figures 5A and 1D ) . wasA (cid:1) cells expressing GFP - tagged WASP ( rescue ) behave normally , accu - mulating active Rac exclusively at the front ( Figure 5B ) . CRIB - mutated WASPs do not suppress the accumulation of active Rac at the rear\u2014both mutants generate discrete puncta that accumulate within the enlarged rear , together with persistent active Rac - marker - positive structures like those seen in unre - scued wasA (cid:1) cells ( Figures 5C and 5D ; Video S3 ) . At a given time , a subset of puncta in WASP CRIB mutants is also enriched 4172 Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 C l a t h r i n G H E D W A SP \u0394 CR I B B A W A SP C l a t h r i n W A SP * * CR I B W A SP C - 5 s - 10 s 15 s 20 s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 10 s - 15 s 30 s 25 s C l a t h r i n C l a t h r i n wasA - , WASP , Clathrin wasA - , WASP \u0394CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP , Clathrin wasA - , WASP \u0394CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP * * CRIB , Clathrin wasA - , WASP * * CRIB , Clathrin F 0 s - 5 s - 10 s - 15 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 10 s 15 s 20 s 25 s 30 s C l a t h r i n W A SP \u0394 CR I B 30 s - 5 s - 10 s - 15 s 1 s 3 s 0 s 2 s 4 s 5 s 10 s 15 s 20 s 25 s C l a t h r i n I W A S P * * C R I B Figure 3 .

( legend continued on next page ) Current Biology 29 , 4169 \u2013 4182 , December 16 , 2019 4173 in active Rac . WASP - CRIB - mutants and active Rac appear to have distinct dynamics : active Rac appears to remain at the plasma membrane for longer than CRIB - mutated WASPs . Therefore , although some active Rac - positive structures are not enriched in CRIB - mutated WASPs , we cannot exclude that they were enriched in CRIB - mutated WASP at some stage . Representative plots showing active Rac marker localization from front to rear are shown in Figure 5E . Quanti\ufb01cation ( Figure 5F ) reveals that cells expressing CRIB - mutated WASPs accumulate active Rac at the rear to the same degree as wasA (cid:1) cells , while wild - type WASP rescues the spatial con\ufb01nement of active Rac at the leading edge . In line with previ - ous reports from wasA (cid:1) cells [ 6 ] , cells expressing either WASP CRIB mutant are signi\ufb01cantly slower than those expressing wild - type WASP ( Figure 5G ) . Our results show that WASP requires an intact CRIB motif to exclude active Rac from the cell rear during migration . WASP Contributes to Homeostasis of Active Rac Levels We examined whether WASP works locally , to remove active Rac from inappropriate locations , or has a more global role in Rac regulation . Taking into account that active Rac is largely membrane bound [ 46 ] , and that the CRIB - based marker interacts selectively with GTP - bound Rac [ 30 ] but is cytosolic when unbound , then the ratio of active Rac marker at the membrane and in the cytosol offers a measure of the total levels of active Rac in the cell [ 12 ] . We therefore measured the relative quantities of active Rac marker at the membrane and within the cytosol in cells express - ing CRIB - mutated WASPs . As shown in Figure 6A ( quanti\ufb01ed in Figure 6B ) , the membrane : cytosol ratio of the active Rac marker is consistently and signi\ufb01cantly higher in cells expressing a CRIB - mutated WASP in comparison with cells expressing wild - type WASP . We con\ufb01rmed this result by pulling down the active Rac from cell lysates using GST - CRIB beads ( Figure 6C ) . Again , we observed a higher level of active Rac in cell expressing WASP CRIB mutants . We also examined the extent of active Rac patches . Cells ex - pressing CRIB - mutated WASPs accumulate the active Rac marker in a signi\ufb01cantly larger portion of their plasma membrane than cells expressing wild - type WASP ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . This increase in active Rac localization is accompanied by a reduc - tion in cell polarity ( Figure 6F ) . Cells expressing wild - type WASP are elongated even when migrating randomly , while those expressing either WASP CRIB mutant are more rounded , with a length : width ratio of nearly one . No signi\ufb01cant difference be - tween the average perimeter of cells expressing wild - type or CRIB - mutated WASPs was seen ( Figure 6G ) , so the more widespread localization of the active Rac marker in cells ex - pressing WASP CRIB mutants is not due to the availability of more plasma membrane . We con\ufb01rmed the correlation between active Rac levels and the proportion of plasma membrane labeled by the active Rac marker using tetracycline - inducible dominant - active ( G12V ) Rac1A . Induction with tetracycline causes cells to accumulate the active Rac marker on a higher proportion of the plasma membrane , often close to 100 % ( Fig - ures S4A and S4B ) . Altogether , our data show that cells whose WASP lacks a functional CRIB motif , and thus cannot bind Rac , accumulate more active Rac on a higher portion of the plasma membrane than cells with an intact WASP . WASP Requires Active Rac Interaction to Replace SCAR / WAVE at Pseudopods Internalization of CCPs is by far the clearest and evolutionarily conserved role of WASP ; however , WASP can contextually ful\ufb01l other biological roles . For instance , WASP can drive protrusion extension in cells that have lost SCAR / WAVE [ 12 ] . We therefore asked whether WASP can drive pseudopods extension inde - pendently of Rac1 , using a cell line in which wasA is knocked out and SCAR expressed under a tetracycline - inducible pro - moter ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet ) . We expressed CRIB - mutated GFP - WASP in wasA (cid:1) scrA tet cells and examined their ability to migrate toward chemoattractant in the presence of tetracy - cline ( when SCAR / WAVE is expressed ) or without ( when the only pseudopod inducer was the exogenously expressed WASP ) . As shown in Figure 7A , cells expressing SCAR / WAVE and wild - type WASP ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / ON / GFP - WASP ) migrate ef\ufb01 - ciently in a chemotactic gradient . In these cells , WASP localizes to F - actin - rich puncta . Once the expression of SCAR / WAVE is turned off ( Figure 7B ) , cells expressing wild - type WASP ( wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP ) are still able to move effectively . In these cells , WASP is additionally localized to the leading edge , where it drives formation of pseudopods , as previously described [ 12 ] .

In each case , the mutated WASPs localize to puncta clustered within the enlarged rear . When expression of SCAR / WAVE is turned off , cells expressing either WASP CRIB mutant lose the ability to move , highly resembling cells lacking SCAR and WASP [ 6 ] ( Figures 7D and 7F ; wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP D CRIB and wasA (cid:1) scrA tet / OFF / GFP - WASP * * CRIB , respectively ) . Under these circumstances , pseudo - pods are no longer generated but replaced by inef\ufb01cient spiky protrusions , which cannot translocate the cell . Thus , a functional CRIB motif\u2014and therefore a direct activa - tion by Rac\u2014is essential for WASP to stimulate pseudopod for - mation in the absence of SCAR / WAVE . DISCUSSION WASP\u2019s Interaction with Small GTPases : Implications for WASP Regulation Considering how important actin nucleation promoting factors are , for processes as diverse as cell movement [ 10 \u2013 12 ] , macro - pinocytosis [ 47 ] , vesicular sorting [ 48 , 49 ] , mitosis [ 50 ] , meiosis [ 51 ] , and DNA repair [ 52 ] , their control is exceptionally poorly un - derstood . The SCAR / WAVE complex contains \ufb01ve proteins [ 21 ] and harbors multiple potential phosphorylation and protein - pro - tein interaction sites [ 53 ] , but the relevance of most is largely un - known . WASPs , the family that includes mammalian WASP and N - WASP , the singular Dictyostelium and Drosophila WASP , were thought to be an exception . Largely based on biochemical data , the interaction with active GTPases ( Cdc42 or Rac ) has long been considered essential for WASP activation . Other factors , such as PIP 2 and adaptor proteins , may contribute to the NPFs activation [ 3 , 4 , 25 , 26 , 54 \u2013 56 ] . But in vitro settings do not reca - pitulate the complexity of a living cell , and early data implying a key role for small GTPases in WASP activation have not been corroborated in living cells . Studies in Drosophila suggest that CRIB - mutated WASP can still ful\ufb01l its developmental roles [ 34 ] , and a CRIB - deleted N - WASP still triggers actin comet tails formation in PIP5K - overexpressing cultured \ufb01broblasts [ 57 ] . Evolutionary arguments point in the same direction : yeasts\u2019 WASPs have lost their Rac - binding CRIB motif during evolution but facilitate CME by a remarkably similar mechanism to higher eukaryotes\u2019 WASPs [ 8 ] . Inotherwords , althoughanumberofreviewsdescribeGTPase binding as an essential step toward WASP localization and acti - vation [ 58 , 59 ] , ourunderstanding ofthis interaction\u2019s importance to living cells is still poor . Our work adds to this complex jigsaw . Byintroducing adeletionwithin theWASP CRIB motif or\u2014impor - tantly\u2014a \ufb01ner mutation that abrogates interaction with Rac using only two conservative substitutions , we show that WASP does not rely on GTPases to localize to CCPs nor to induce Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymerization once there . WASP\u2019s Role in Front - Rear Polarity If WASP does not need GTPases to localize to CCPs or to trigger actin polymerization on puncta , why does it interact with them ? CRIB motifs are the best - understood GTPase interactors , with high speci\ufb01city for the active forms of Rac and Cdc42 [ 23 ] . Dic - tyostelium lacks a Cdc42 [ 28 ] , which \ufb01rst appears just before fungal and metazoan evolutionary lineages divide , but its WASP has a well - conserved CRIB motif that gives strong binding speci\ufb01city to active Rac1A and C [ 27 ] . What are its physiological roles ? We provide two related answers . First , WASP needs a direct interaction with active Rac to compensate for loss of SCAR / WAVE . WASPs are not normally involved in pseudopod forma - tion [ 60 ] but take over when SCAR / WAVE is absent [ 17 ] . Because active Rac is the key speci\ufb01er of the leading edge , it is unsurpris - ing that WASP requires Rac binding to do so . ThesecondroleforRacbindingtoWASPismoresubtle . WASP exploits its CRIB motif to prevent aberrant accumulation of the GTPaseatthecellrear . WhenthereisnoWASP , cellslosepolarity in an idiosyncratic way\u2014they generate pseudopods at the front but also carry a substantial , complex assembly at the rear that slows and depolarizes them . This aggregate contains active Rac and therefore continuously recruits SCAR / WAVE and Arp2 / 3 complex , inducing actin polymerization . This raises two main Figure 4 .

It highlights our poor understanding of the uro - pod , which may simplistically be seen as a black hole where un - necessary migratory components are passively drawn , and it un - derscoresourincompleteknowledge ofhowcellsachievespatial and functional segregation of WASP and SCAR / WAVE . We propose a novel role for WASP as a homeostatic regulator of active Rac . We envision a model whereby WASP at CCPs , in addition to triggering Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated actin polymeri - zation , also removes active Rac from the membrane through its CRIB motif . In wild - type cells , we cannot detect the \ufb02uorescent active Rac marker at endocytic puncta , primarily for two rea - sons . First , active Rac that is recruited to a CCP is WASP bound , and thus unable to also bind our active Rac marker ; second , the high membrane background masks the few active Rac mole - cules that , we predict , are recruited by each CCP . WASP - medi - ated clearance of active Rac will obviously occur faster when GTPases are excessively activated , and slower when there is lit - tle GTPase activation , so cellular levels of active Rac are main - tained . Spatially , given that CME occurs mostly at the rear of migrating cells , active Rac will be removed faster there . Thus , WASP will ensure that active Rac is removed from the cell rear , maintaining front - rear polarity . Our proposed role of WASP does not exclude other models of cell polarity . Rather , WASP - mediated clearance of active Rac may collaborate with other mechanisms underpinning spatial con\ufb01nement of active Rac , such as membrane tension [ 61 ] , in maintaining a dominant front . WASP and CRIB Motifs : \u2018\u2018The Cowl Does Not Make the Monk\u2019\u2019 When WASP was \ufb01rst discovered , the presence of a CRIB motif led researchers to conclude that its activity was dependent on GTPases [ 3 ] . This now seems an oversimpli\ufb01cation . We have shown here that WASP does not rely on the availability of ( nor on the interaction with ) active Rac to recruit Arp2 / 3 complex , or drive actin polymerization , during CME . On the other hand , WASP depends on a direct , CRIB - mediated , interaction with D wasA - , WASP * * CRIB Active Rac 30s 60s 90s 0s Active Rac WASP * * CRIB w a s A - W a s A - / G F P - W ASP W a s A - / G F P - W ASP CR I B W a s A - / G F P - W ASP * * CR I B 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 p = 0 . 0004 p < 0 . 0001 C e ll s peed ( \u03bc m / m i n ) G F A c t i v e R a c a cc u m u l a t i on a t t he r ea r ( % f r a m e s ) w a s A - W a s A - / G F P - W ASP W a s A - / G F P - W ASP CR I B W a s A - / G F P - W ASP * * CR I B 0 20 40 60 80 100 p < 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 A 30s 60s 90s 0s Active Rac wasA - Active Rac B WASP Active Rac 0s 30s 60s 90s wasA - , WASP Active Rac C Active Rac 0s 30s 60s 90s WASP \u0394CRIB wasA - , WASP \u0394CRIB Active Rac E A c t i v e R a c f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y ( A .

Therefore , WASP\u2019s requirement for active Rac appears to be context dependent , not an absolute requirement as initially thought . In the broader context , this means that inhibiting Rac may not of itself compromise WASP functionality . WASP has many physiological roles ( e . g . , invadopodia forma - tion ) , and its CRIB motif is likely to be important for a subset of other processes that we have not explored .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell culture Dictyostelium wild - type , wasA knockout , and inducible double null cells were grown at 22 (cid:3) C on Petri dishes in HL5 supplemented with vitamins and micro - elements ( Formedium ) . Biochemistry E . coli BL21 cells transformed with bacterial expression vectors were plated on ampicillin - containing SM plates , or kept in LB medium plus ampicillin in shaking conditions ( 100 or 200 rpm ) at room temperature or 37 (cid:3) C as needed . METHOD DETAILS Cell transfection Prior to transfection , Dictyostelium cells were resuspended in E - buffer ( 10 mM KNaPO 4 , pH 6 . 1 , 50 mM sucrose ) , incubated with DNA of interest , and elecroporated at 500V using the ECM399 system ( Harvard Apparatus UK ) . Transfected cells were then transferred in Petri dishes containing medium , and selected 24 hour later by addition of 50 m g / ml hygromycin . Protein puri\ufb01cation E . coli BL21 cells were transformed with a pGEXRac1A - encoding vector by heat - shock at 42 (cid:3) C , and plated overnight on ampicillin - containing SM plates . One colony was transferred to a tube containing LB medium ( 1 % Bacto - tryptone , 0 . 5 % Bacto - yeast extract , 17 mM NaCl , pH 7 ) plus ampicillin , and kept in shaking condition ( 200 rpm ) at 37 (cid:3) C until it reached the OD 600 of 2 . The bacterial sus - pension was then transferred in a larger volume of LB medium plus ampicillin , and kept overnight in shaking conditions ( 100 rpm ) at room temperature . Once the bacterial suspension reached the OD 600 of 0 . 4 , 500 m M IPTG ( Isopropyl b - D - 1 thiogalactopyranoside ) was added to yield the expression of GST - Rac1A , and bacteria were kept overnight in shaking conditions ( 100 rpm ) at room temper - ature . Bacteria were then spun down using the Avanti J6 - MI centrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) at 4 (cid:3) C 3000 rpm for 20 minutes , and lysed using a detergent - based lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 1mM DTT ) . The lysate was sonicated 10 times at the maximum power with 10 s interval between cycles using a Soniprep 150 ( MSE ) , and spun down at 4 (cid:3) C for 10 minutes at 12096 3 g using an Avanti J - 25 centrifuge ( Beckman Coulter ) . The sonicated lysate was incubated for 2 hours at 4 (cid:3) C with beads ( Glutathione High Capacity Magnetic Agarose Beads , Sigma - Aldrich ) previously washed in Rac buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 1mM DTT ) . The beads were then washed in Rac buffer and incubated with 1 mM GTP g s ( Guanosine 5 0 - [ b , g - imido ] triphosphate trisodium salt hydrate , Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C in the presence of 15 mM EDTA and 100 units of CIP ( Alkaline Phosphatase , Calf Intestinal , NEB ) . MgCl 2 was ultimately added to the tube at the \ufb01nal concen - tration of 60 mM in order to close the Rac\u2019s nucleotide - binding pocket . GST - Rac pull - down assay and immunoblotting Dictyostelium cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8 , 100 mM NaCl , 30 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 1mM DTT ) and the resulting lysate added to the tube containing GTP g s - Rac1A - loaded beads for 1 hour at 4 (cid:3) C . The tubes were placed on a magnet and washed twice in washing buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8 , 100 mM NaCl , 30 mM MgCl 2 , Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , 1mM DTT ) . Beads were then washed twice with 1 mL of washing buffer , resuspended in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer ( ThermoFisher ) and incubated at 100 (cid:3) C for 5 minutes . Proteins contained in the eluted fraction were separated using NuPAGE 4 % \u2013 12 % Bis - Tris protein gels ( ThermoFisher ) . Protein were transferred on nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham Protran (cid:2) , Merck ) at 80V for 1 hour . The membrane was blocked for 1 - hour in the presence of 5 % semi - skimmed milk diluted in TBS . The blocked membrane was incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with the desired primary antibody .

The membrane was washed three times with TBST , scanned using Odyssey CLx ( LI - COR ) and analyzed using Image Studio Lite TM soft - ware ( LI - COR ) . Active Rac pull - down assay Active Rac levels were determined by pull - down assay using GST - PAK - CRIB immobilised to Glutathione beads according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( Cytoskeleton , Inc , Active Rac Kit ) . Brie\ufb02y , wasA - cells expressing GFP - WASP ( wasA - / GFP - WASP ) or respective CRIB mutants ( wasA - / GFP - WASP * * CRIB and wasA - / GFP - WASP D CRIB ) were collected from a con\ufb02uent 30 cm Petri dish and resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with HALT TM EDTA - free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail at 4 (cid:3) C . After a brief clari\ufb01cation at 10 , 000 3 g for a minute , the supernatant is loaded into GST - PAK - CRIB beads in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 1 hour at 4 (cid:3) C with gentle rotation . The washed beads were then resuspended in 2x sample buffer and boiled for 3 minutes at 95 (cid:3) C . Proteins contained in the eluted fractions were separated using NuPAGE 12 % Bis - Tris protein gels ( ThermoFisher ) and transferred into nitro - cellulose membrane as described previously . The membrane is then blocked for 30 minutes in the presence of 5 % semi - skimmed milk diluted in TBS . The blocked membrane was incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with a mouse monoclonal anti - Rac antibody ( 1 : 500 dilu - tion ) . The membrane was washed once with TBST and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in 5 % BSA in TBST . After three washes , the membrane was scanned using Odyssey CLx ( LI - COR ) and analyzed using Image Studio Lite TM software ( LI - COR ) . Wild - type cells expressing G12V Rac1A under a tetracycline - inducible promoter was used a positive control in the above experiments . In short , cells were treated with tetracycline to the \ufb01nal concentration of 10 m g / ml to induce Rac G12V expression . Cells were harvested 2 - 3 hours post - induction and processed as described above . The levels of active Rac is quanti\ufb01ed using Image Studio Lite TM . Microscopy Super - resolution microscopy was adopted to investigate the ability of WASP CRIB mutants to localize to clathrin - coated pits and to recruit the Arp2 / 3 complex . Images were acquires using a Zeiss LSM880 equipped with a 63x / 1 . 40 NA objective . GFP was excited at 488 nm , RFP at 561 nm . Images were acquired using the ZEN imaging software every 1 or 2 s . TIRF microscopy was utilized to monitor the dynamics of clathrin , WASPs , Arp2 / 3 complex and actin on the ventral surface of the cells . Images were acquired using a modi\ufb01ed Nikon Eclipse TE 2000 - U microscope equipped with a photometrics Evolve 512 camera and a DualView DV2 emission splitter . GFP and RFP were excited using 473 nm and 561 nm wavelengths respectively . A 100x / 1 . 40 NA TIRF objective was used . Images were acquired every 1 or 2 s using the MetaMorph software . Phase - contrast microscopy was performed to test the ability of cells expressing WASP CRIB mutants to migrate following loss of SCAR / WAVE . Images were acquired using a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000 - E inverted microscope with a 10x / 0 . 30 NA objective and equipped with a QImaging Retiga EXi digital camera . Spinning disk confocal microscopy was utilized to monitor WASP dynamics upon expression of dominant active Rac . Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti - E inverted microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU - X spinning disc confocal unit in combination with a High resolution Andor Neo sCMOS camera . A 100x / 1 . 4 NA objective was used . GFP was excited at 488 nm , RFP at 561 nm . Images were acquired using the Andor IQ 2 software . Chemotaxis assay The under - agarose chemotaxis assay [ 62 ] was used to investigate the ability of cells expressing no WASP or WASP CRIB mutants to con\ufb01ne active Rac at the leading edge during migration , as well as the ability of inducible double null cells expressing WASP CRIB mutants to generate pseudopods following loss of SCAR / WAVE . A 50mm glass bottom dish ( MatTek ) was \ufb01rst treated with 10 mg / ml BSA to reduce the resistance encountered by cells crawling under agarose . Seakem GTG agarose was dissolved to the \ufb01nal con - centration of 0 . 4 % in LoFlo ( Formedium ) , a low \ufb02uorescence medium that improves the quality of imaging . Dissolved agarose was cast on a pre - treated glass bottom dish and allowed to set . Once set , the agarose was cut using a scalpel so to create two wells separated by a 5 mm bridge ; this was gently wriggled loose to facilitate cells\u2019 crawling .

  "leclainche2007hip1r": "A Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly associated with endocytosis Christophe Le Clainche 1 , Barbara S Pauly , Claire X Zhang , A\u02dasa EY Engqvist - Goldstein , Kimberley Cunningham and David G Drubin * Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , CA , USA Actin polymerization plays a critical role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in many cell types , but how poly - merization is regulated is not known . Hip1R may negatively regulate actin assembly during endocytosis because its depletion increases actin assembly at endocytic sites . Here , we show that the C - terminal proline - rich do - main of Hip1R binds to the SH3 domain of cortactin , a protein that binds to dynamin , actin \ufb01laments and the Arp2 / 3 complex . We demonstrate that Hip1R deleted for the cortactin - binding site loses its ability to rescue fully the formation of abnormal actin structures at endocytic sites induced by Hip1R siRNA . To determine when this complex might function during endocytosis , we performed live cell imaging . The maximum in vivo recruitment of Hip1R , clathrin and cortactin to endocytic sites was coincident , and all three proteins disappeared together upon formation of a clathrin - coated vesicle . Finally , we showed that Hip1R inhibits actin assembly by forming a complex with cortac - tin that blocks actin \ufb01lament barbed end elongation .

In yeast and in many mammalian cells , actin assembly is transiently nucleated at coated pits ( Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al , 2003 ) , and the impairment of actin polymerization affects vesicle scission and many aspects of clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) dynamics ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2005 ; Yarar et al , 2005 ) . On the basis of protein interac - tions , several pathways could link the actin nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex to dynamin , a large GTPase that is required for vesicle scission in mammals . The proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dyna - min is capable of binding to intersectin , endophilin A and syndapin 1 , which might recruit N - WASP ( Hussain et al , 2001 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2002 , 2006 ; Da Costa et al , 2003 ; Otsuki et al , 2003 ) . N - WASP , in turn , activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate actin assembly associated with CME ( Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2004 ; Benesch et al , 2005 ; Innocenti et al , 2005 ) . Dynamin also binds to cortactin ( McNiven et al , 2000 ) , another Arp2 / 3 complex activator ( Uruno et al , 2001 ; Weaver et al , 2001 ) . Cortactin is localized at CCPs ( Cao et al , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) and , interestingly , the timing of cortactin recruitment coincides with vesicle scission ( Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2005 ) . Cortactin is also required for the clathrin - dependent entry of Listeria into host cells ( Veiga and Cossart , 2005 ) . Currently , how Arp2 / 3 activators are regulated at endo - cytic sites is not clear . Recent data suggested that Hip1R , an F - actin and clathrin - binding protein ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 1999 , 2001 ) , and its yeast homologue , Sla2p , negatively regulate actin assembly associated with CME ( Kaksonen et al , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) and clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) budding from the trans - Golgi network ( Carreno et al , 2004 ) . However , the mechanism by which Hip1R inhibits actin assembly is currently not known . In addition , Hip1R binds to CIN85 ( Cbl - interacting protein of 85kDa ) , an SH3 domain - containing adaptor protein that controls traf\ufb01cking of EGF receptors along the endocytic and recycling pathways ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ) . Here , we provide evidence for a Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex in vitro and in vivo . We show that the complex contributes to the regula - tion of actin assembly in HeLa cells and we establish the relative timing of recruitment of these proteins to endocytic sites . Speci\ufb01cally , we show that the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin assembly by capping \ufb01lament barbed ends . Results Hip1R interacts directly with cortactin Because Hip1R depletion leads to cortactin - dependent actin polymerization at coated pits ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) , we tested for an interaction between these proteins . Cortactin was immunoprecipitated from clathrin coat ex - tracts , and the immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti - Hip1R antibody ( see Supplementary Materials and methods ) . The coprecipitation of Hip1R with cortactin sug - gests that a Hip1R - cortactin complex is present at the surface of CCVs ( Figure 1A ) . The comparison between fractions of Hip1R bound and unbound to cortactin indicated that the totality of cortactin was immunoprecipitated but only a small amount of Hip1R is coprecipitated , suggesting that cortactin is not a structural protein of CCVs ( Figure 1A ) . To test whether this interaction is direct , recombinant GST - tagged cortactin was used in attempts to pull down recombinant His - tagged Hip1R . We discovered that these two proteins interact directly ( Figure 1B ) . To map precisely the Hip1R - binding domain of cortactin , we used GST fusions of cortactin to Received : 20 March 2006 ; accepted : 4 January 2007 ; published online : 22 February 2007 * Corresponding author .

We identi\ufb01ed the SH3 domain ( amino acids 491 \u2013 546 ) of cortactin as the Hip1R - binding site ( Figures 1B and D ) . We also quanti\ufb01ed the af\ufb01nity of the interaction between Hip1R and cortactin using a pull - down assay , and found a high af\ufb01nity ( K d \u00bc 20nM , Figure 1C , see Supplementary Materials and methods ) . To map the cortac - tin - binding site of Hip1R , we used two constructs of Hip1R truncated from the N - and C - terminal domains , which con - tain , respectively , the ANTH domain that binds phosphatidyl - inositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) , and the talin - like domain that binds F - actin . Although deletion of the N - terminal do - main results in a lower af\ufb01nity , deletion of the C - terminal domain had a much more severe effect ( Figure 2A ) . To con\ufb01rm the importance of the C - terminal domain , we used several GST fusions of Hip1R domains to pull down His - tagged cortactin . Only the C - terminal domain binds to cor - tactin ( Figure 2B ) , albeit with a lower apparent af\ufb01nity compared to full - length Hip1R . Interestingly , the C - terminal PRD of Hip1R contains several known and putative SH3 - binding motifs within the last 51 amino acids ( 1018 \u2013 1068 ) ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ) . To characterize further this cortactin - binding domain , we deleted the last 51 amino acids of Hip1R . We found that this deleted version of Hip1R ( 1 \u2013 1017 ) did not bind to the SH3 domain of cortactin or to full - length cortactin ( Figure 2C ) . In total , these data show that the SH3 domain of cortactin binds to the C - terminal PRD of Hip1R , but that high - af\ufb01nity binding is dependent upon the presence of the N - terminal domain of Hip1R ( Figures 1D and 2D ) . A Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex contributes to the regulation of actin assembly at endocytic sites To investigate further the involvement of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex in the regulation of actin dynamics in vivo , we used the mutant of Hip1R deleted for the last 51 amino acids ( Hip1R 1 \u2013 1017 ) that no longer binds to cortactin in vitro ( Figure 2C ) . To test the effect of this Hip1R mutant on actin dynamics in vivo , we treated HeLa cells with RNAi to knock down endogenous Hip1R protein levels . This was shown to lead to the formation of abnormal actin structures at endo - cytic sites ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . These structures were also dependent on the presence of cortactin as double knockdown of Hip1R and cortactin led to a decrease in the number of these structures ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Expression of wild - type Hip1R protein ( Hip1R 1 \u2013 1068 ) re - sulted in loss of these abnormal actin structures , indicating that Hip1R is necessary to negatively regulate actin dynamics at endocytic sites ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . To deter - mine if the binding of cortactin to Hip1R contributes to this inhibition of actin assembly , we compared the ability of wild - Figure 1 Hip1R interacts with the SH3 domain of cortactin .

When we reduced Hip1R levels in HeLa cells using the siRNA duplex A3 ( described in Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) , 72 . 6 7 6 . 6 % of the cells formed abnormal actin structures ( Figure 3A and C ) , whereas only 7 . 5 7 1 . 2 % of the control - treated cells ( InvC1 ) contained these structures ( Figure 3A and B ) . Expression of wild - type Hip1R in A3 - treated cells abolished this phenotype and decreased the number of the structures to the level of the control ( 8 . 8 7 1 . 3 % ) ( Figure 3A and D ) . In contrast , expres - sion of Hip1R - 1 \u2013 1017 in A3 - treated cells reproducibly failed to suppress the phenotype to the extent of the full - length protein because a signi\ufb01cant portion of the cells ( 21 . 5 7 3 . 6 % ) showed abnormal actin structures ( Figure 3A and E ) . Importantly , the A3 - treated cells that were not rescued by the expression of Hip1R 1 \u2013 1017 showed more and longer tails compared to the A3 - treated cells that were not rescued by the wild - type Hip1R ( Figure 3D and E ) . These results indicate that a functional Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex contributes to normal actin turnover at endocytic sites . Real - time imaging of Hip1R and cortactin at CCPs To determine when this Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex might function during endocytosis , we quantitatively analyzed the temporal appearance of Hip1R and cortactin at endocytic sites . Previous immuno - EM studies revealed that both pro - teins are present during all stages of CCP formation ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2001 ; Cao et al , 2003 ) . In addition , Hip1R appeared to link actin \ufb01laments to CCPs , whereas cortactin was found on actin \ufb01laments and actin \ufb01lament branches throughout the plasma membrane ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2001 ; Cao et al , 2003 ) . Total internal re\ufb02ection \ufb02uorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) was performed to image Hip1R - GFP or cortactin - GFP on the surfaces of cells stably expressing DsRed - clathrin ( Figure 4 ) . Consistent with previous reports , Hip1R appeared at essentially all of the clathrin patches , whereas cortactin appeared at about one - third of the clathrin patches ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ; Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2005 ) . We found that Hip1R recruitment follows the course of CCP growth , albeit with a small delay compared to clathrin ( Figure 4A , C and E ) . When a CCP started to disappear , Hip1R behavior was essentially the same as that of clathrin . These observations are consistent with previous observations , but with greater time resolution ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2001 ; Keyel et al , 2004 ) . In contrast , cortactin recruitment was more precipitous , occur - ring close to the time of CCV formation , and cortactin \ufb02uorescence lingered slightly longer after clathrin dis - appeared ( Figure 4B , D and E ) . A recent study by Merri\ufb01eld et al ( 2005 ) showed a similar pattern for cortactin accumulation and correlated the cortac - tin peak with vesicle scission .

Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 1201 peaked concomitantly , it is plausible that the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex may also regulate actin polymerization during ve - sicle invagination , neck constriction and scission . The Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin assembly In previous studies , we showed that the coiled - coil domain of Hip1R ( 346 \u2013 655 ) is responsible for localization of Hip1R to CCPs ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 1999 ) , whereas the C - term - inal domain ( 656 \u2013 1068 ) is responsible for the inhibition of actin assembly in vivo ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the C - terminal domain is known to bind F - actin , and we showed here that it also contains a cortac - tin - binding activity . Hence , we speculated that a Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex might inhibit actin assembly . Figure 3 Hip1R \u2013 cortactin contributes to the regulation of actin assembly at endocytic sites .

Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 1202 To test for activities of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex on actin dynamics , we performed actin polymerization kinetics assays using pyrenyl - labeled actin ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . Increasing concentrations of Hip1R alone up to 1 m M had only a very small effect on actin assembly ( Figure 5A ) . However , in the presence of 0 . 4 m M cortactin , the same concentrations of Hip1R inhibited actin assembly in a dose - dependent fashion , whereas cortactin alone had only a very small effect ( Figure 5B ) . A decrease in \ufb01nal polymerized actin in the presence of Hip1R and cortactin was also con\ufb01rmed by an actin pelleting assay ( Figure 5C ) . Finally , actin \ufb01laments from the same experiment were observed by \ufb02uorescence microscopy after dilution and stabilization by rhodamine - labeled phalloidin . The observation of single actin \ufb01laments and quanti\ufb01cation of polymerized actin showed a decrease in actin assembly in the presence of cortactin and Hip1R ( Figure 5D and E ) . The Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin assembly at the barbed end speci\ufb01cally Several mechanisms may account for the inhibition of actin assembly by the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex : sequestration of actin monomers , actin \ufb01lament depolymerization or capping of actin \ufb01lament barbed ends . To determine the mechanism by which the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin assem - bly , we \ufb01rst tested whether this complex caps the barbed end of growing actin \ufb01laments . First , we studied the elongation of spectrin \u2013 actin seeds , which are short actin \ufb01laments capped at their pointed ends . Barbed end growth was inhibited with a delay and a complete inhibition was observed after 600 s , with a half - time of 150s ( Figure 6A ) . In contrast , elongation of gelsolin \u2013 actin complexes , which are actin nuclei capped at their barbed ends , was not affected by the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex ( Figure 6B ) . Therefore , we conclude that the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits barbed end elongation speci\ufb01cally , and is not a sequestering protein or a depolymerizing factor . To quantify this inhibition further , we calculated the concen - tration of free barbed ends over time from the curves pre - sented in Figure 6A ( Figure 6C ; see Materials and methods ) . It is important to note that a total inhibition of barbed end elongation is observed in the presence of 0 . 5 m M Hip1R and 0 . 5 m M cortactin , demonstrating that the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex not only decreases the rate constant for actin assembly \u2013 disassembly at barbed ends like a \u2018leaky capper\u2019 ( Romero et al , 2004 ) , but blocks actin assembly like a barbed end capping protein . The plateau of each curve was plotted as a function of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex concentration using the K d we calculated previously in Figure 1C . The best \ufb01t of this curve gave a K d \u00bc 85nM , which represents the af\ufb01nity of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex for the barbed end ( inset , Figure 6C ) . We compared the activity of Hip1R 1 \u2013 1068 ( full length ) and Hip1R 1 \u2013 1017 . We found that increasing concentrations of Hip1R 1 \u2013 1017 in the presence of 0 . 5 m M cortactin did not Figure 4 Timing of Hip1R and cortactin recruitment to CCPs .

Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 1203 cap actin \ufb01lament barbed ends , whereas similar concentra - tions of Hip1R 1 \u2013 1068 in the presence of 0 . 5 m M cortactin blocked actin \ufb01lament barbed end elongation , demonstrating that this activity requires a physical interaction between Hip1R and cortactin ( Figure 6D ) . Hip1R 346 \u2013 1068 , deleted for the N - terminal domain , was also tested for its ability to inhibit barbed end growth in the presence of cortactin . Increasing concentrations of Hip1R 346 \u2013 1068 inhibited the elongation of spectrin \u2013 actin seeds in the presence of cortactin ( Figure 6D ) . Hip1R 346 \u2013 1068 in conjunction with cortactin displayed a very low activity in agreement with our data showing that its af\ufb01nity for cortactin is markedly reduced ( Figures 2A and 6D ) . Barbed end capping was also tested by dilution - induced depolymerization of actin \ufb01laments ( Figure 6E and F ) . Although Hip1R alone did not affect actin depolymerization signi\ufb01cantly , 25nM cortactin alone partially stabilized actin \ufb01laments from depolymerization ( Figure 6E ) . This effect likely re\ufb02ects the ability of cortactin to stabilize actin contacts along the \ufb01lament and it would also explain why cortactin slightly enhances the elongation of gelsolin \u2013 actin complexes ( Figure 6B ) . In the presence of Hip1R and cortactin , actin \ufb01lament depolymerization was completely inhibited , con\ufb01rming that the barbed end dynamics are inhibited ( Figure 6E and F ) . Binding of cortactin to Hip1R , N - WASP or dynamin is mutually exclusive The N - terminal half of cortactin is known to bind to actin \ufb01laments and to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Uruno et al , 2001 ; Weaver et al , 2001 ) , whereas the C - terminal SH3 domain of cortactin has been implicated in multiple func - tions . First , it binds and stimulates the ability of N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Martinez - Quiles et al , 2004 ; Kowalski et al , 2005 ) . Second , the SH3 domain of cortactin can bind to the PRD of dynamin , which is proposed to allow cortactin to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex at endocytic sites ( Zhu et al , 2005 ) . Therefore , it was important to determine how formation of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex affects cor - tactin\u2019s activities on endocytosis - associated components of the actin nucleation machinery such as Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP and dynamin . Because it is thought that a major function of cortactin is to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Uruno et al , 2001 ; Weaver et al , 2001 ) , we \ufb01rst tested whether Hip1R affects the ability of a high concentration of cortactin ( 1 m M ) to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Increasing Hip1R concentrations up to 1 . 5 m M in the presence of 1 m M cortactin and 350nM Arp2 / 3 complex inhibited actin assembly in a Hip1R dose - dependent fashion ( Figure 7A ) . Figure 5 The Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin assembly .

Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 1204 We also tested the ability of Hip1R to inhibit the activation of N - WASP by cortactin in an actin polymerization assay in vitro . We worked at a low concentration of cortactin ( 50nM ) at which the activation of Arp2 / 3 and the capping in the presence of high concentrations of Hip1R were both negligible ( Figure 7B ) . Under these conditions , cortactin was still a potent activator of N - WASP . However , we found that Hip1R inhibited actin assembly in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP and cortactin in a dose - dependent fashion , whereas it did not affect actin assembly in the presence of Arp2 / 3 and N - WASP ( Figure 7B ) . The maximum inhibition corresponds to the activity of N - WASP in the absence of cortactin , demonstrating that Hip1R inhibits the activation of N - WASP by cortactin independent of the capping activity of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex ( Figure 7B , inset ) . In cells , dynamin assembles at the plasma membrane and is thought to recruit activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex such as cortactin to initiate actin assembly in a spatiotemporally regulated fashion . Previously , it has been shown that dynamin - coated liposomes recruit phalloidin - stabilized actin bundles in the presence of cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Schafer et al , 2002 ) . We wished to establish the activity of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex in a similar assay using non - stabilized material . Therefore , we observed the spatial organization of actin structures generated by dyna - min - coated liposomes in the presence of cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex to determine the effect of Hip1R on the formation of these structures . We used an assay , in which dynamin assembles at the surface of Texas Red - labeled dioleyl phosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) liposomes ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) in the presence of cortactin , the Arp2 / 3 complex and Alexa488 - labeled actin . In contrast to results from the previous study ( Schafer et al , 2002 ) , samples were observed directly by \ufb02uorescence microscopy without phal - loidin and without subsequent dilution . We found that actin clouds formed on the liposome surfaces . However , essentially no actin structures were observed on liposomes in the absence of dynamin , cortactin or the Arp2 / 3 complex , de - monstrating that the presence of liposome - associated actin clouds is the result of nucleation of \ufb01laments by the pathway leading from DOPS to dynamin to cortactin to Arp2 / 3 ( Figure 7C and D ) . Importantly , in the presence of Hip1R , the ability Figure 6 The Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin \ufb01lament barbed end assembly . ( A ) Barbed end growth was measured in the presence of 100pM spectrin \u2013 actin seeds ( SP ) , 1 m M MgATP \u2013 G - actin , 10 % pyrenyl - labeled and the indicated concentrations of Hip1R and cortactin . ( B ) Pointed end growth was measured in the presence of 4nM gelsolin \u2013 actin ( GA2 ) complex , 1 . 5 m M MgATP \u2013 G - actin , 10 % pyrenyl - labeled and the indicated concentrations of Hip1R and cortactin . ( C ) The concentration of free barbed ends over time in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Hip1R and cortactin are derived from the corresponding kinetics of barbed end growth shown in panel A ( Pantaloni et al , 2000 ) ( see also Materials and methods ) . Inset , the relative inhibition ( fraction of inhibited barbed ends corresponding to the plateau of each kinetics curve ) was plotted versus the concentration of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex . The binding curve for the interaction of the complex with the actin barbed end was calculated using the equation described in the Materials and methods with the best - \ufb01t value of K d \u00bc 85nM . ( D ) The fraction of barbed ends inhibited was plotted versus the total concentration of Hip1R 1 \u2013 1068 ( black circles ) , Hip1R 1 \u2013 1017 ( open circles ) and Hip1R 346 \u2013 1068 ( open squares ) in the presence of 0 . 5 m M cortactin . ( E ) Hip1R \u2013 cortactin inhibits actin depolymerization induced by dilution . Depolymerization of actin \ufb01laments ( 2 m M , 35 % pyrenyl - labeled ) was induced by a 40 - fold dilution into polymerization buffer in the presence of indicated concentrations of Hip1R and cortactin . ( F ) Depolymerization rates in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Hip1R with ( open squares ) and without ( closed circles ) cortactin ( 25nM ) . All the experiments were performed three times with the same results . Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 1205 of liposomes to generate actin clouds was greatly reduced . To determine whether in this assay Hip1R binds to cortactin to cap actin \ufb01laments or prevent the SH3 domain of cortactin from interacting with dynamin , we tested the ability of dynamin to bind GST - cortactin in the presence and absence of Hip1R . We found that Hip1R prevented the association of cortactin with dynamin ( Figure 7E ) . Discussion Here , we reported the discovery and functional characteriza - tion of a novel endocytic complex composed of Hip1R and cortactin . We presented evidence that this complex has a novel actin \ufb01lament capping activity , and explored when and how this complex may function during endocytosis . As both proteins are also present in actin - rich ruf\ufb02es at the cell periphery ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 1999 ) , and on the surface of the Golgi ( Carreno et al , 2004 ; Cao et al , 2005 ) , we speculate Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complexes may function to regulate a variety of actin - mediated processes . Importance of Hip1R and cortactin in endocytosis The depletion of Hip1R by siRNA induced the formation of abnormal actin tails suggesting that this protein plays a critical role in the inhibition of actin assembly at endocytic sites . The depletion of cortactin by siRNA abolished the formation of these actin tails , suggesting that the formation of these structures involves the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by cortactin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . In addition , our data indicate that cortactin binding to Hip1R contributes to the inhibition of actin assembly at endocytic sites . We also showed that Hip1R and cortactin levels peak concomitantly during vesicle internalization , further pointing towards a role for the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex in the regula - tion of actin assembly during endocytosis . These observa - tions clearly show the importance of Hip1R and cortactin in the regulation of actin assembly during CME . Figure 7 Hip1R inhibits Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization pathways .

All the experiments were performed three times with the same results . Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 1206 However , the speci\ufb01c roles of these two proteins during endocytosis are still unclear . The depletion of Hip1R caused a mild defect in transferrin uptake , and we showed in a previous study that cortactin siRNA did not affect transferrin uptake ( Barroso et al , 2006 ) . Although Sauvonnet et al ( 2005 ) reported that the depletion of cortactin by siRNA decreased the amount of transferrin internalized , they did not take into consideration the possibility that there might be less trans - ferrin receptor at the cell surface of siRNA - treated cells . By contrast , the importance of actin assembly in vesicle invagi - nation and scission has been clari\ufb01ed recently ( Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2005 ; Yarar et al , 2005 ) . One possibility to accommodate these various observations is that several actin nucleation machineries are involved in the process of vesicle internali - zation , and hence the impact of impairing the function of a single pathway may be hard to detect . Moreover , we found that a truncation mutant of Hip1R defective in cortactin binding , while being reduced relative to the full - length pro - tein in the ability to rescue the actin tail formation phenotype of cells treated with a Hip1R siRNA , nevertheless , partially rescued the phenotype . These results point to complexity in the pathways that regulate actin assembly at endocytic sites , consistent to what has been observed in yeast cells ( Sun et al , 2006 ) . Interestingly , the C - terminal domain of Hip1R contains two PXXXPR SH3 - binding motifs ( 1025 \u2013 1030 and 1044 \u2013 1049 ) . The three SH3 domains of the protein CIN85 bind to the \ufb01rst motif ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ) . We showed that mutations of the two arginines in alanine that abolish the binding of CIN85 ( Kowanetz et al , 2004 ) did not affect cortactin binding and fully rescue the Hip1R siRNA in HeLa cells , suggesting that the binding of CIN85 to Hip1R does not contribute to the regulation of actin assembly at endocytic sites ( data not shown ) . The Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex caps actin \ufb01lament barbed ends In a previous study , we showed that RNAi depletion of Hip1R in HeLa cells increases actin assembly associated with en - docytic sites and reduces the rate of CME , suggesting that Hip1R\u2019s inhibitory effect on actin assembly facilitates ef\ufb01cient endocytosis ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Here , we showed that a Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex inhibits actin \ufb01la - ment barbed end growth in vitro . Interestingly , the barbed end growth inhibition was delayed , similar to what was reported for the heterodimeric capping protein ( Schafer et al , 1996 ; Wear et al , 2003 ) . A variety of capping proteins like CP , Eps8 or twin\ufb01lin are thought to block growth of actin \ufb01lament barbed ends to favor elongation of uncapped barbed ends , in a process known as funneling ( Schafer et al , 1996 ; Disanza et al , 2004 ; Helfer et al , 2006 ) . This funneling mechanism might facilitate a variety of actin - based motility processes like lamellipodium protrusion and Listeria propul - sion ( Loisel et al , 1999 ; Pantaloni et al , 2001 ) . It is therefore tempting to speculate that the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex mimics capping proteins to facilitate steps in endocytic vesicle formation . Our in vivo data support the conclusion that the interaction of cortactin with Hip1R contributes to the inhibition of actin assembly at endocytic sites and show that Hip1R and cortactin concomitantly peak at the moment of vesicle internalization . In addition to our \ufb01ndings , the requirement of actin \ufb01lament barbed end cap - ping for endocytosis is supported by recent \ufb01ndings . In yeast , capping protein is important for the initial movement of endocytic vesicles away from the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen et al , 2005 ; Kim et al , 2006 ) . In addition to the funneling of actin monomers , local capping could limit the growth of the actin network to the neck of the vesicle to prevent the network from surrounding the vesicle and impairing its inward movement . The roles of cortactin in Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation and in capping with Hip1R are mutually exclusive Previously , dynamin , cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex were shown to be capable of recruiting actin bundles to liposomes ( Schafer et al , 2002 ) . Here , we extended these observations by the discovery using liposomes in vitro that dynamin recruits cortactin , which in turn activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate actin assembly . In mammalian cells , actin nuclea - tion at endocytic sites involves the Arp2 / 3 complex and at least two activators , N - WASP and cortactin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ; Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2004 , 2005 ) . Although the relative contribution of N - WASP and cortactin to Arp2 / 3 activation at endocytic sites is not known , we showed in a previous study that assembly of exaggerated actin \u2018tail\u2019 structures at endocytic sites in the absence of Hip1R depends on cortactin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Recent studies also showed that N - WASP regulates actin assembly at CCPs ( Benesch et al , 2005 ; Innocenti et al , 2005 ) . Together , these data support the view that N - WASP and cortactin activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in a sequential or synergistic fashion to generate new barbed ends concentrated near the plasma membrane at the vesicle neck where dyna - min is localized ( Weaver et al , 2001 , 2002 ; Uruno et al , 2003 ) . Interestingly , we found that the C - terminal PRD of Hip1R interacts with the SH3 domain of cortactin . The SH3 domain of cortactin activates N - WASP by binding to its PRD ( Martinez - Quiles et al , 2004 ; Kowalski et al , 2005 ) . This SH3 domain is thought to be responsible for the targeting of cortactin to the PRD of dynamin at endocytic sites , where cortactin directly stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Zhu et al , 2005 ) . Our data show that Hip1R inhibits the activation of N - WASP by cortactin and prevents cortactin from binding to dynamin - associated liposomes to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 com - plex . These results re\ufb02ect the competition of Hip1R , N - WASP and dynamin PRDs for the SH3 domain of cortactin . Therefore , the binding of cortactin to N - WASP and dyna - min - associated membranes leading to the localized activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and the formation of a Hip1R \u2013 cortac - tin complex that caps actin \ufb01laments are mutually exclusive . Because dynamin is localized at the neck of the vesicle ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al , 1998 ) and Hip1R is localized at the surface of the CCV ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 1999 ) , it is tempting to suggest a spatial separation of the capping and nucleating activities associated with cortactin ( Figure 8 ) . How do the individual and combined functions of Hip1R and cortactin cooperate to facilitate endocytosis ? The timing of cortactin and Hip1R appearance we reported here , together with similar recruitment kinetics for dynamin , actin , Arp3 and N - WASP , and the impairment of CCP Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 1207 dynamics after actin drug treatments , all point to an impor - tant role for carefully regulated actin polymerization during the late stages of CME ( Merri\ufb01eld et al , 2002 , 2004 , 2005 ; Yarar et al , 2005 ) . FRAP analysis that addressed the polarity of this growing actin network demonstrated that actin nucleation occurs continuously at endocytic sites in both yeast and mammals ( Kaksonen et al , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Actin assembly in yeast occurred proximal to the plasma membrane , and actin \ufb01laments were then moved off the membrane into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al , 2003 ) . In this context , we propose that actin \ufb01laments are con - tinuously generated at the vesicle neck by a mechanism that involves activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by cortactin , N - WASP and possibly other proteins . The resulting \ufb01laments continuously move off the plasma membrane into the cyto - plasm . Hip1R , by binding simultaneously to clathrin and actin \ufb01laments , anchors the CCV to the actin meshwork engaged in retrograde \ufb02ow and facilitates movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm . The studies presented here demonstrate that Hip1R binds to cortactin to form a complex that inhibits actin \ufb01lament barbed end elongation . We pro - pose that this complex funnels actin monomers to newly formed , uncapped barbed ends , to accelerate the growth of the actin network , hence facilitating the formation of CCVs . Our model suggests versatility of Hip1R and cortactin function . Each provides distinct functions , in attaching the actin meshwork to the clathrin coat and promoting clathrin assembly ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2001 ; Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al , 2005 ) , and in activating the Arp2 / 3 complex and stabilizing \ufb01lament branches ( Uruno et al , 2001 ; Weaver et al , 2001 ) , respectively , as well as a combined function , in capping \ufb01laments near the site of new \ufb01lament assembly ( Figure 8 ) . Materials and methods Polymerization assays Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in \ufb02uorescence of 10 % pyrenyl - labeled actin . Actin polymerization was induced by addition of 100mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2mM EGTA to a solution of Ca - ATP - G - actin containing the desired proteins . Fluor - escence measurements were carried out at 25 1 C in a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrophotometer . The concentration of free barbed end as a function of time was derived from spectrin actin seed elongation kinetics , and calculated for each time point using the following equation : d C = d t \u00bc k \u00fe \u00bd F (cid:4)\u00bd G (cid:4) \u00bd F (cid:4) \u00bc\u00f0 d C = d t \u00de = \u00f0 k \u00fe \u00bd G (cid:4)\u00de where [ F ] is the concentration of free barbed ends in m M , d C / d t the rate of actin assembly in m Ms (cid:7) 1 , k \u00fe the association constant for monomer to the barbed end of actin \ufb01laments ( 10 m M (cid:7) 1 s (cid:7) 1 ) and [ G ] the concentration of polymerizable actin in m M . The af\ufb01nity of the Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex for barbed ends was calculated as follows . The concentration of free barbed ends at the assembly plateau calculated as described above was taken as a measure of free barbed ends . The following equation was used to \ufb01t the data . The fraction R of Hip1R \u2013 cortactin bound to barbed ends is R \u00bc ( [ A0 ] \u00fe [ B0 ] \u00fe K (cid:7) ( ( [ A0 ] \u00fe [ B0 ] \u00fe K ) 2 (cid:7) 4 [ A0 ] [ B0 ] ) 0 . 5 ) / 2 [ A0 ] , where [ A0 ] is the concentration of spectrin \u2013 actin seeds , [ B0 ] the concentration of Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex and K is the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K d ) of the complex with the barbed end . Live cell imaging TIR - FM was performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a (cid:8) 60 / NA1 . 45 . lens and 488nm argon ion laser ( Melles Griot ) . The temperature was maintained at 27 . 5 1 C using a Bioptechs chamber . The 488nm laser was used to excite both GFP and DsRed . Simultaneous two - color imaging was performed using an image splitter ( Optical Insight ) to separate the red and green emission signals to two sides of the camera sensor using a 565nm dichroic mirror , and 530 / 30 and 630 / 50nm emission \ufb01lters . No bleed - through between the red and the green channel was detected under our conditions . Swiss 3T3 cells that stably express DsRed - mLCa ( mouse clathrin light chain a ) were transiently transfected with Hip1R - GFP or cortactin - GFP using Lipofectamine reagent ( Invitrogen ) 48h before imaging . Each cell was imaged every 2s for 200 \u2013 300 frames . After each experiment , images of immobilized microbeads that \ufb02uoresce at both green and red wavelengths were captured . These images were used to align the cell images . Image analysis We used similar criteria to select single CCPs for analysis as described by Merri\ufb01eld et al ( 2002 ) . We only counted the CCPs , which had either Hip1R or cortactin as well . The maximum \ufb02uorescence intensity of GFP or DsRed at each CCP was measured using the ImageJ program , and was plotted against time . Data from Figure 8 Model for the endocytic roles of actin , Hip1R and cortactin in endocytosis . ( 1 ) Hip1R binds to the clathrin coat , possibly stimulating or stabilizing its assembly on the inner face of the plasma membrane , and binds to actin \ufb01laments . ( 2 ) Dynamin assembles around the neck of the nascent CCV . Cortactin interacts with dynamin , stimulates the Arp2 / 3 complex to form branched actin \ufb01laments , and stabilizes the branched junctions . The actin meshwork grows via new \ufb01lament assembly at the vesicle neck . The actin network is anchored to the clathrin coat by Hip1R , so that the vesicle is pushed away from the plasma membrane . Hip1R forms a complex with cortactin to cap actin \ufb01lament barbed ends near the clathrin coat . Hip1R \u2013 cortactin complex negatively regulates actin assembly C Le Clainche et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 5 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 1208 10 frames before the appearance of the CCP , and 10 frames after the disappearance of the CCP , were also obtained , and the smallest value was set as the background . After background correction , the \ufb02uorescence intensity was normalized with the maximum value set at 100 . The last point of the clathrin \ufb02uorescence peak before dimming was set as the 0 time . An average of 30 CCPs that underwent a complete cycle of appearing and disappearing was analyzed for each protein pair . Treatment of HeLa cells with siRNA For knockdown of endogenous Hip1R , the siRNA - A3 was prepared as described in Engqvist - Goldstein et al ( 2004 ) . This sequence is designed to target nucleotides 184 \u2013 204 of human Hip1R ( GenBank accession no . BAA31630 ) . The siRNA - InvC1 was used as a control and does not target a gene . HeLa cells were plated 1 day before transfection in 24 - well plates on coverslips at a density of 1 (cid:8) 10 4 cells / well . On the day of transfection , the cell density was B 30 % . For transfection , 1 . 5 m l of siRNA duplex ( 20 m M ) was diluted into 50 m l OptiMem ( Invitrogen Corp . , Carlsbad , CA ) in tube 1 . In tube 2 , 3 m l OligoFectamine ( Invitrogen Corp . , Carlsbad , CA ) was diluted into 12 m l OptiMem . Tubes 1 and 2 were incubated for 10min at room temperature ( RT ) before being combined . This mixture was incubated at RT for 20min . OptiMem ( 38 m l ) was then added to the mixture and the solution was added to the cells grown in 0 . 5ml of DMEM with 10 % FBS . Rescue experiments One day after transfection of the siRNA , cells were transfected with mouse Hip1R ( amino acids 1 \u2013 1068 ) - 6myc or mouse Hip1R ( amino acids 1 \u2013 1017 ) - 6myc . Details of the cloning procedure and vector construction can be found in Engqvist - Goldstein et al ( 1999 ) . Transfections were carried out using Fugene 6 ( Roche Diagnostics ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Forty - eight hours after transfection , cells were \ufb01xed and processed for immuno\ufb02uores - cence as described previously ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 1999 ) . The following primary antibodies were used : anti - cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ; Upstate Biotechnology ) at a dilution of 1 : 100 and anti - myc antibody ( A - 14 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) at a dilution of 1 : 400 . Secondary antibodies were FITC donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) for anti - cortactin , and rhodamine donkey anti - rabbit ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) for anti - myc , both used at a dilution of 1 : 200 . For scoring the A3 phenotype , cells were stained for cortactin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2004 ) . Cells were scored as positive if they had three or more ring - or tail - like structures containing cortactin . Two independent experiments were performed scoring 200 cells from each experiment . In the rescue experiments , scoring was performed as described above , except that in these experiments only cells expressing the rescue construct ( as judged by myc staining ) were scored . Preparation of liposomes A mixture of DOPS ( Avanti Polar ) ( 2mM ) and dioleyl phosphati - dylethanolamine ( DOPE ) ( 2 m M ) in chloroform / methanol ( 19 : 1 ) was dried in a rotary evaporator for 45min at 37 1 C . After gently adding degassed 0 . 3M sucrose , the \ufb02ask was \ufb02ushed with argon , sealed and left undisturbed for 2h at 37 1 C to allow spontaneous formation of liposomes . The liposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 12000 g for 20min at RT , and resuspended in 25mM HEPES \u2013 KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 25mM KCl , 2 . 5mM magnesium acetate and 100mM potassium acetate . Finally , the liposomes were extruded using a 5 m m \ufb01lter ( Avanti Polar ) . Reconstitution of actin assembly on liposomes DOPS liposomes ( 10 m M ) were incubated with 1 m M dynamin , 1 m M cortactin , 0 . 5 m M Arp2 / 3 complex , 3 m M actin , 1 m M Hip1R , 0 . 3 m M Alexa488 - labeled actin , 2mM ATP , 2mM MgCl 2 , 5mM DTT , 0 . 1mM 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo ( 2 . 2 . 2 ) octan and 0 . 1 % BSA , for 30min at RT ( proteins puri\ufb01cations are described in the Supplementary Materi - als and methods ) . Although the ANTH domain of Hip1R binds to PIP2 speci\ufb01cally , these conditions ensure that a possible nonspeci\ufb01c interaction with the negatively charged DOPS does not affect dynamin binding . The solution ( 3 m l ) was pressed between a slide and a coverslip , sealed and imaged using a Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a 100 / NA 1 . 4 objective and Orca - 100 - cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) . We analyzed all the liposomes and calculated the liposome / actin ratio for every liposome including the ones that did not form actin clouds .

We performed a kinetic analysis of a truncated myo1e that consists of the motor and the single IQ motif with a bound calmodulin . We determined the rates and equilibrium constants for the key steps in the ATPase cycle . The maximum actin activated ATPase rate ( V max ) and the actin concentration at half - maxi - mum of V max ( K ATPase ) of myo1e are similar to those of the native protein . The K ATPase is low ( ! 1 ! M ) , however the affinity of myo1e for actin in the presence of ATP is very weak . A weak actin affinity and a rapid rate of phosphate release result in a pathway under in vitro assay conditions in which phosphate is released while myo1e is dissociated from actin . Actin activation of the ATPase activity and the low K ATPase are the result of actin activation of ADP release . We propose that myo1e is tuned to function in regions of high concentrations of cross - linked actin filaments . Additionally , we found that ADP release from actomyo1e is > 10 - fold faster than other vertebrate myosin - I isoforms . We propose that subclass - 1 myosin - Is are tuned for rapid sliding , whereas subclass - 2 isoforms are tuned for tension main - tenance or stress sensing . Myosin - I motors are the single - headed , low molecular weight , membrane - associated members of the myosin superfamily ( 1 ) . The molecular details of myosin - I function in the cell are not known , but myosin - Is are thought to play important roles in cortical membrane tension ( 2 ) , endocytosis and endocytic traffick - ing ( 3 \u2013 6 ) , signal transduction ( 7 ) , and membrane ruffling ( 6 , 8 ) . Myosin - Is are the most diverse of the unconventional myosins and are represented by at least two phylogenetically distinct subclasses based on sequence comparison of motor domains ( 9 ) . Subclass - 1 myosin - I isoforms have long tails that contain lipid binding ( TH1 ) , proline - rich ( TH2 ) , and Src homology - 3 ( TH3 ) domains . Subclass - 1 isoforms were first discovered in lower eu - karyotes ( 10 ) and are sometimes termed \u201camoeboid\u201d isoforms . However , vertebrate members of this subclass have been identi - fied ( 11 , 12 ) . Subclass - 2 myosin - I isoforms have short tails that contain only TH1 domains and are also widely expressed ( 9 ) . The kinetic mechanisms of all characterized myosin - Is follow the same pathway with the same biochemical intermediates ( 13 \u2013 16 ) . However , considerable kinetic variability exists within the myosin - I family . Key rate constants of isoforms from lower eukaryotes are significantly faster ( 3 \u2013 10 - fold ) than those of the vertebrate isoforms . The characterized lower eukaryote iso - forms belong to subclass - 1 ( 13 ) , and the characterized verte - brate isoforms are members of subclass - 2 ( 14 \u2013 16 ) , thus sug - gesting the possibility that kinetic properties correlate with the isoform subclass rather than with the specific organism . Meas - urement of the rate constants of a vertebrate subclass - 1 iso - form will help determine whether kinetic properties are con - served within the subclasses . Additionally , knowing the rate constants of the different isoforms allows us to understand the physical limitations and properties of myosin - I isoforms and thus provides insight into the cellular functions of the sub - classes . Comparisons of the sequences of myosin - I subclasses may also help unravel the structural modifications required for kinetic tuning of all myosin motors . Myo1e , also known as myr - 3 ( 12 ) and human myosin - IC ( 11 ) , is the subclass - 1 myosin - I expressed in nearly all vertebrate cells . Localization studies show that myo1e is found in regions of high actin concentration ( 17 , 18 ) , and steady - state biochem - ical investigations suggest that myo1e is capable of cross - link - ing actin filaments via an ATP - insensitive actin binding site in its tail ( 19 ) . This cross - linking results in triphasic actin acti - vated ATPase activity . Unlike myosin - Is from lower eu - karyotes , the ATPase activity of myo1e appears to be regulated allosterically by its tail domain ( 19 ) , and the ATPase activity is not predicted to be regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation by p21 - activated kinase homologs ( 20 ) . We measured all of the key rate constants in the myo1e ATPase pathway and found that , like subclass - 1 isoforms from lower eukaryotes , the rate constants are significantly faster than the characterized verte - brate subclass - 2 isoforms , thus suggesting conservation of ki - netics and function within a single subclass across phylogenetic boundaries . However , we also found differences in the myo1e kinetics which may tune the motor for function in regions of high actin concentration .

Actin was labeled with pyrenyl iodoacetamide ( pyrene - actin ) and gel filtered ( 24 ) . All actin was stabilized with a molar equiv - alent of phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Calmodulin ( CaM ) was expressed in bacte - ria and purified as described ( 25 ) . Steady - state and transient experiments were performed at 25 % 0 . 1 \u00b0 C in KMg50 buffer ( 10 m M imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 1 m M DTT ( 26 \u2013 28 ) ) or KMg0 buffer ( 10 m M imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 1 m M DTT ) . Free CaM ( 1 \u2013 3 \" M ) was included in all solutions . Myosin - I Expression and Purification \u2014 The cDNA for human myo - sin - IC ( accession NM 004998 ) , kindly provided by W . M . Bement ( Uni - versity of Wisconsin ) , was truncated at Glu 720 , generating a construct containing the motor domain and the only IQ motif ( referred to as myo1e IQ throughout the paper ) . A FLAG peptide sequence was inserted at the C terminus and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 ( Invitrogen ) . Recombinant baculovirus was generated using standard procedures . Myo1e IQ with bound calmodulin was purified from Sf9 cells that were coinfected with virus containing recombinant myo1e IQ and CaM ( Fig . 1 ) . Four liters of log phase cells ( 2 & 10 6 cells / ml ) were infected and incubated at 27 \u00b0 C for 60 h with shaking . Cells were harvested by centrifugation ; suspended in lysis buffer ( 10 m M Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 200 m M NaCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 5 m M DTT , 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 0 . 01 mg / ml aprotinin , 0 . 01 mg / ml leupeptin ) , 2 m M MgATP , and 0 . 05 % Igepal at 4 \u00b0 C ; and homogenized with five strokes in a Dounce homog - enizer . Cell extract was centrifuged at 100 , 000 & g for 1 h . The super - natant was loaded onto anti - FLAG antibody columns ( Sigma ) . Columns were washed with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer \u2019 2 m M MgATP and 5 column volumes of lysis buffer . Myo1e IQ was eluted with 10 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 m M NaCl , 1 m M DTT , 5 \" M CaM , 0 . 2 mg / ml FLAG peptide ( Sigma ) , 0 . 01 mg / ml aprotinin , 0 . 01 mg / ml leupeptin . Eluted protein was loaded directly on to an 8 - ml Mono Q column ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) equilibrated in column buffer ( 10 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 25 m M KCl , 1 m M DTT ) and eluted with a linear 25 m M \u2013 1 M KCl gradient . The Mono Q column separated myo1e IQ from FLAG peptide , ADP , ATP , and free CaM . Fractions containing myo1e IQ were dialyzed versus storage buffer ( 10 m M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 100 m M KCl , 1 m M EGTA , 1 m M DTT , 50 % glycerol ) , which concentrated the protein and allowed for storage at $ 20 \u00b0 C . Quantitative densitometry showed that myo1e IQ was ( 95 % pure , and the CaM : myo1e IQ ratio was 1 : 1 . Approximately 2 mg of pure myo1e protein was obtained from 4 liters of cells . Steady - state ATPase Activity and Sedimentation Assays \u2014 Steady - state ATPase activities were measured in KMg50 or KMg0 buffer at 25 \u00b0 C using the NADH - coupled assay as described ( 27 ) . Steady - state binding of 0 . 2 \" M myo1e IQ to 0 \u2013 50 \" M actin was measured in KMg50 and KMg0 at 25 \u00b0 C in the presence of 2 m M MgATP by ultracentrifu - gation assays ( 350 , 000 & g for 20 min ) . The fraction of actin - bound myosin was determined by assaying the NH 4 / EDTA ATPase activity of the supernatant ( 29 ) . Stopped Flow , Quenched Flow , and Kinetic Modeling \u2014 Transient kinetic measurements were made at 25 \u00b0 C with an Applied Photophys - ics ( Surrey , UK ) SX . 18MV stopped flow having a 1 . 2 - ms dead time . Tryptophan fluorescence ( # ex # 295 nm ) was measured using a 320 nm WG long pass emission filter ( Oriel ) . A 400 nm long pass filter ( Oriel ) was used to monitor pyrene ( # ex # 365 nm ) , and mantADP and man - tATP ( # ex # 295 nm ) fluorescence . Usually three to five transients were averaged before nonlinear least square fitting . The time courses pre - sented in the figures show the average of one to four individual traces . Transients were fitted to exponential functions using the software supplied with the stopped flow . Transient P i release was measured using the coupled assay system containing the fluorescently labeled mutant of the phosphate - binding protein ( P i BP ( 30 , 31 ) ) with the stopped flow in sequential mixing mode using an excitation wavelength of 425 nm and a 440 nm long pass filter . The dead time of the instru - ment in this configuration was ! 2 ms . Quenched flow measurements were performed with a KinTek ( State College , PA ) RQF - 3 apparatus . Errors reported are standard errors in the fits . Kinetic modeling and simulations were performed using Scheme 1 of the actomyosin ATPase , where A is actin and M is myosin . Computer simulations were performed with KSIM ( Neil C . Miller ) or Berkeley - Madonna ( Robert I . Macey and George F . Oster ; University of California , Berkeley ) . RESULTS Steady - state ATPase and Actin Binding Parameters \u2014 The ATPase activities of subclass - 1 myosin - I isoforms from all lower eukaryotes are activated by phosphorylation of serine or threonine at the TEDS site in an actin binding , surface loop by proteins that have homology to p21 - activated kinases ( 20 ) . Although myo1e has serines immediately adjacent to the TEDS site , it is not predicted to be regulated by heavy chain phos - phorylation ( 20 ) . We were unable to phosphorylate myo1e IQ with Pak3 or Acanthamoeba myosin - I heavy chain kinase ( not shown ) , thus confirming the TEDS rule ( 20 ) . The steady - state ATPase activity of myo1e IQ is activated ! 2 - fold by actin filaments . Steady - state ( Fig . 2 ) and single turnover measurements ( not shown ) gave rates of ! 0 . 6 s $ 1 in the absence of actin ( Table I ) in KMg50 . The actin concentra - tion at half - maximum of the steady - state ATPase rate ( K ATPase ) is 1 . 2 % 0 . 36 \" M , and the maximum ATPase rate ( V max ) at saturating actin is 1 . 2 % 0 . 03 s $ 1 . The triphasic ATPase activ - ity observed with native myo1e was not observed ( 19 ) . Steady - state actin binding measurements show that myo1e IQ is dissociated predominantly from 0 \u2013 50 \" M actin in KMg0 ( Fig . 2 ) and KMg50 ( not shown ) in the presence of 2 m M MgATP . There - fore , in the presence of ATP , the predominant steady - state myo1e IQ intermediates have a very weak affinity for actin with F IG . 1 . Purification of myo1e IQ .

Myo1e IQ Binding to Actin Filaments \u2014 An ! 80 % fluorescence quenching upon strong binding of myo1e IQ to pyrene - actin al - lowed us to monitor the association of myo1e IQ with actin in the absence ( Reaction 1 ) and presence ( Reaction 2 ) of MgADP .

Time courses of myo1e IQ and myo1e IQ - ADP binding to pyrene - actin follow single exponentials rates that depend linearly on the actin concentration ( Fig . 3 A ) . The apparent second order rate constant for myo1e IQ binding to actin ob - tained from the slope is k $ 7 # 9 . 0 % 0 . 7 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Table II ) . The apparent second order rate constant for myo1e IQ - ADP binding to actin is k $ 11 # 1 . 2 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Table II ) . The rate of dissociation of myo1e IQ and myo1e I - ADP from pyrene - actin was measured by competition with 60 - fold excess of unlabeled actin ( Fig . 3 B ) . Time courses fit single exponen - tials with rates k \u2019 7 # 0 . 056 s $ 1 and k \u2019 11 # 0 . 065 s $ 1 ( Table II ) . Dissociation equilibrium constants ( K 7 and K 11 ) calculated from the dissociation and association rates ( k \u2019 7 / k $ 7 and k \u2019 11 / k $ 11 ) are K 7 # 6 . 2 n M and K 11 # 55 n M ( Table II ) . MantATP Binding to Myo1e IQ and Actomyo1e IQ \u2014 We used the enhancement in fluorescence of the ATP analog mantATP to measure the rate of nucleotide binding .

Steady - state ATPase and actin binding activity of myo1e IQ . The actin concentration dependence of the steady - state turn - over of 50 n M myo1e IQ in KMg0 ( f ) and KMg50 ( \u25cf ) was measured using the NADH - coupled assay . The data points represent acquisitions from three different preparations , and the solid lines are best fits to rectan - gular hyperbolas .

The two exponentials are not the result of the presence of multiple mantATP isomers ( 33 ) because a two exponential fluorescence increase was also detected when ex - periments were performed with dmantATP , which is a single - isomer preparation of mantATP . The amplitude of the fast exponential phase is 70 \u2013 80 % of the signal , and its rate is linearly related to the dmantATP concentration ( Fig . 4 A ) . We assumed a two - step ATP binding reaction , M $ ATP - | 0 K 1 M ( ATP ) O \u00a1 k \u2019 2 M ! ATP * R EACTION 3 where K 1 is a rapid equilibrium and k \u2019 2 is a rate - limiting isomerization to the high fluorescence state of dmantATP ( ATP * ) . The apparent second order rate constant for dmant - ATP binding , given by the slope of the plot of the observed rate versus nucleotide concentration , is K 1 k 2 # 11 % 0 . 4 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Fig . 4 A ) . Fits of the slow exponential phase yielded an appar - ent second order rate constant 0 . 65 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Fig . 4 A , inset ) . It was proposed for skeletal muscle subfragment - 1 that this slow rate reports the conformational change that accompanies ATP hydrolysis ( k 3 , Scheme 1 ( 33 ) ) . A two - exponential fluorescence increase was also observed in the presence of actin . The amplitude of the fast exponential phase is 40 \u2013 60 % of the signal , and its rate is linearly related to the nucleotide concentration with an apparent second order rate constant of K 1 \" k 2 \" # 3 . 7 % 0 . 3 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Fig . 4 B ) . The linear fit of the rates does not pass through the origin . The apparent second order rate constant determined from the slow exponential phase is 0 . 15 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Fig . 4 B , inset ) . ATP - induced Population of the Weakly Bound States \u2014 Py - rene - actin fluorescence was used to monitor the ATP - induced population of the weakly bound states ( 13 , 34 ) . Mixing ATP with pyrene - actomyo1e IQ resulted in an increase in fluores - cence ( Fig . 5 A , upper trace in inset ) . Fluorescence transients were best fit to single exponentials at all ATP concentrations examined , and the rate of the fluorescence increase was hyper - bolically related to the ATP concentration ( Fig . 5 A ) . The mech - anism of ATP - induced fluorescence enhancement was modeled as shown in Reaction 4 , AM $ ATP - | 0 K 1 \" AM ( ATP ) O \u00a1 k \u2019 2 \" A * M ! ATP k \u2019 9 ( k $ 9 A * $ M !

The maximum rate is k 2 \" # 440 % 9 . 0 s $ 1 and K 1 \" # 397 % 23 \" M ( Table II ) . The association rate constant for MgATP binding to actomyo1e IQ obtained from the initial slope ( K 1 \" k 2 \" ) is 0 . 86 % 0 . 11 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ( Fig . 5 B ) with a y intercept of zero . Light scattering measurements were used to monitor the rate of actomyo1e IQ dissociation by MgATP ( Fig . 5 A ) .

The time courses follow single exponentials with rates that depend hyperboli - cally on the MgATP concentration ( Fig . 5 A ) . Fits to Reaction 4 yielded rate constants ( K 1 \" # 334 % 46 \" M ; k \u2019 2 \" # 439 % 23 s $ 1 ) nearly identical to those obtained with pyrene - actin ( Table II ) . Therefore , the maximum rate of dissociation ( k \u2019 9 ) upon ATP binding is limited by k \u2019 2 \" ( Reaction 4 ) . ATP Hydrolysis \u2014 The rate of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin ( k \u2019 3 \u2019 k $ 3 ; Scheme 1 ) was measured directly by quenched flow ( Fig . 6 ) . There is a rapid initial burst of ATP hydrolysis which fits a single exponential with a rate of 108 % 14 s $ 1 at 50 \" M MgATP . The rate of ATP binding under exper - imental conditions is expected to be ( 500 s $ 1 ( Table II ) , so this measurement is not limited by the rate of nucleotide associa - tion . The presence of a phosphate burst indicates that the rate - limiting step occurs after ATP hydrolysis . The amplitude of the phosphate burst is 0 . 55 P i / myosin ( Fig . 6 ) . If we assume that B # K 3 / ( 1 \u2019 K 3 ) and K 3 # ( k \u2019 3 / k $ 3 ) , then K 3 # 1 . 2 , k \u2019 3 # 59 s $ 1 , and k $ 3 # 49 s $ 1 ( Table II ) . Phosphate Release \u2014 Fluorescently labeled P i BP was used to measure directly the rate of phosphate release ( k \u2019 4 and k \u2019 4 \" ) in sequential mix , single turnover , stopped flow experiments ( Fig . 7 A ( 30 ) ) . Apyrase - treated myo1e IQ ( 2 \" M ) was mixed with 1 \" M ATP , aged for 400 ms to allow for ATP binding , and mixed with 0 \u2013 40 \" M actin ( Fig . 7 B ) . P i BP was included with the myo1e IQ and the actin to prevent transients resulting from phosphate released during the age time or phosphate contamination in the actin . The time course of phosphate release in the absence of actin follows a single exponential with a rate of 1 . 5 s $ 1 in KMg0 and KMg50 ( Fig . 7 A ) . There is no lag in the phosphate release transients ( Fig . 7 A , inset ) , indicating that phosphate release precedes ADP release . Unlike previously characterized myo - sins ( 28 , 30 ) , actin did not increase the rate of phosphate release ( Fig 7 B ) . This result is likely caused by the weak affinity of the M ! ADP ! P i state for actin ( see \u201c Discussion \u201d ) . ADP Association and Dissociation \u2014 The fluorescence in - crease of mantADP was used to determine the rate constants for ADP association to myo1e IQ and actomyo1e IQ ( Fig . 8 ) . In the absence of actin , time courses of fluorescence fit two exponen - tial rates with approximately equal amplitudes . The fast phase was hyperbolically related to the nucleotide concentration ( Fig . 8 A ) and modeled as a two - step binding reaction , M $ ADP - | 0 1 / K 6 M ( ADP ) O \u00a1 k $ 5 M ! ADP ! R EACTION 5 where * indicates high mantADP fluorescence . The maximum rate is k $ 5 # 237 % 13 s $ 1 and K 6 # 6 . 0 % 0 . 9 \" M ( Table II ) . The rate of the slow exponential phase shows only a slight nucleo - tide dependence and plateaus at ! 11 s $ 1 at ( 10 \" M mantADP ( Fig . 8 A , inset ) . The origin of this second exponential is not known , but it may report the population of a second M ! ADP state ( see \u201c Discussion \u201d ) . In the presence of actin , time courses of fluorescence were best fit to single exponential rates that were linearly related to the nucleotide concentration ( Fig . 9 A ) . The signal to noise ratio of the fluorescence signal limited the range of testable mant - ADP concentrations , so we were not able to measure the max - imum rate of mantADP binding ( k $ 5 \" ) . Therefore , the apparent second order rate constant for mantADP binding was obtained by a linear fit to the data assuming the two - step binding model of Reaction 5 ( k $ 5 \" / K 6 \" # 13 % 1 . 8 \" M $ 1 s $ 1 ; Fig . 9 A ) . The non - zero y intercept reveals a dissociation rate constant of k \u2019 5 \" # 93 % 5 s $ 1 . The rates of mantADP dissociation from myo1e IQ ( Fig . 8 B ) and actomyo1e IQ ( Fig . 9 A , inset ) were measured by competition with 250 - fold excess of MgATP . Fluorescence time courses of mantADP dissociation fit two - exponential rates of 6 . 3 and 1 . 7 s $ 1 in the absence of actin and a single exponential rate of k \u2019 5 \" # 104 % 4 s $ 1 in the presence of actin ( Table II ) . The rate of MgADP dissociation from actomyo1e IQ is similar to that re - ported by the y intercept in the mantADP association experi - ment ( Fig . 9 A ) .

Fluorescence transients fit single exponential rates that had a hyperbolic dependence on the MgADP concentration , suggest - ing that AM ! D and AM states are in rapid equilibrium . There - fore , the dependence of k obs on MgADP concentration is as follows , k obs % k 0 1 $ \" ) ADP * K d # ( Eq . 1 ) where k obs is the observed dissociation rate , k 0 is the dissocia - tion rate in the absence of ADP ( K 1 \" k 2 \" [ ATP ] ; Table II ) , and K d is the dissociation equilibrium constant for ADP ( K 5 \" K 6 \" ) . Non - linear least square fits to the data yielded a dissociation equi - librium constant of K 5 \" K 6 \" # 3 . 9 % 0 . 29 \" M ( Table II ) , which is similar to the calculated value ( K 5 \" K 6 \" # 8 \" M ) using associa - tion and dissociation rate of mantADP . DISCUSSION Overview of the Myo1e IQ ATPase \u2014 Myo1e IQ has a high basal ATPase rate ( v o ; Table I ) , yet all measured rate constant are ( 2 - fold faster than v 0 ( Table II ) , so we cannot assign a single step as rate - limiting . The slower turnover number is the result of two sequential steps ( phosphate release and ADP release ) with nearly equivalent rates . Kinetic modeling of the ATPase reaction using our determined rate constants ( Table II ) yields an ATPase rate ( v 0 # 0 . 65 s $ 1 in KMg50 ) , which is similar to the experimentally determined value ( v 0 # 0 . 58 % 0 . 04 s $ 1 ; Table I ) . The predominant steady - state intermediates in the absence of actin are M ! ADP ! P i and M ! ADP ( Scheme 1 ) . Overview of the Actomyo1e IQ ATPase \u2014 Myo1e IQ has a low K ATPase and has a ! 2 - fold actin activation of its ATPase rate ( Table I ) , which is similar to that found for the native molecule . Actin ( 0 \u2013 40 \" M ) does not increase the rate of P i release in KMg0 or KMg50 ( Fig . 7 B ) . Therefore , actin activation of P i release is not the mechanism for actin activation of the ATPase rate , as it is for other myosins . Rather , the increased ATPase rate is the result of actin activation of ADP release . The pre - dominant pathway under actin concentrations used in our as - says is one in which ( a ) ATP binding , actin dissociation , and ATP hydrolysis are fast and not rate - limiting ; ( b ) P i is released while myosin is detached from actin ; ( c ) M ! ADP binds to actin ; and ( d ) ADP is released from actin - bound myosin ( Fig . 10 A , outlined pathway ) . The rate - limiting step at saturating actin ( V max ) is defined by the rate of P i release ( k \u2019 4 ) , because at saturating actin ADP release is ! 100 s $ 1 ( Table II ) . The K ATPase value is related to the affinity of the M ! ADP state for actin . Because binding measurements indicate that myo1e IQ binds weakly to actin in the presence of ATP ( Fig . 2 ) , the predominant steady - state intermediate is an actin - detached M ! ADP ! P i state . ATP Binding and Actomyo1e IQ Dissociation \u2014 The binding of ATP to myo1e IQ and actomyo1e IQ , as determined by dmantATP fluorescence , is fast . The rate of binding at physiological nucle - otide concentrations is ( 100 - fold faster than the rate - limiting step ( s ) . Therefore , the nucleotide - free state of myo1e IQ is not significantly populated . The rate of population of the weak binding states as measured by pyrene - actin fluorescence and light scattering is also fast , and ATP - induced dissociation from F IG . 8 .

The observed rate ( k obs ) at each ADP concen - tration was obtained by fitting the fluorescent transient to a single exponential . The solid line is the best fit of the data to a hyperbola as described in Equation 1 . Kinetic Mechanism of Myo1e 21519 a t U n i v e r s it y o f C a li f o r n i a , B e r k e l e y on A ugu s t 8 , 2019 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m actin is limited only by the rate of ATP binding . The rate of ATP binding to actomyo1e IQ as measured by mant fluorescence is ! 4 - fold faster than the rate measured by pyrene - actin fluorescence or light scattering . Additionally , the linear fit of the rates of dmantATP binding to actomyo1e IQ does not pass through the origin ( Fig . 4 B ) but gives a y intercept of 25 s $ 1 . The value of the y intercept likely reports a reverse isomerization rate ( k $ 2 \" ) of myo1e IQ . However , because the rate of ATP - induced dissociation of actomyo1e IQ is ( 400 s $ 1 ( Fig . 5 ) and essentially irreversible under the low actin concentration conditions of the experiment , a relatively slow reverse isomer - ization of the ATP binding step should not be observable . Therefore , the faster rate of mantATP binding and the ob - served reversal rate ( k $ 2 \" ) are likely the result of an artifact because of the fluorescent modification of the 3 \" position of ATP . Although the dmantATP experiments probably do not report the true rate constants for ATP binding in the presence of actin , the experiments do reveal differences in the structural isomerization required for tight ATP binding in the presence and absence of actin . Additionally , because similar mant arti - facts are not seen with other characterized myosins ( e . g . 14 ) , the experiments show that there are significant structural differences at the nucleotide binding sites of myosin - I isoforms . Phosphate Release \u2014 The v 0 and V max rates and the extent of actin activation of myo1e IQ ( Table I ) are similar to the values measured for native myo1e purified from rat liver ( 19 ) , so the biochemical rate and equilibrium constants determined for Sf9 - expressed myo1e IQ are likely identical to the native mole - cule . Therefore , the fast rate of P i release ( k \u2019 4 ) is not an artifact of the expression system or of the expression of a truncated protein . The rate of phosphate release from all previously character - ized myosins is increased by actin binding ( 28 , 30 , 35 ) . How - ever , we did not detect actin activation of phosphate release from myo1e IQ . We propose that the lack of actin activation is caused by the low affinity of the M ! ADP ! P i state for actin . Other myosins bind actin in the presence of ATP with equilibrium dissociation constants + 50 \" M at low ionic strength conditions ( 36 , 37 ) , whereas myo1e IQ clearly binds with a dissociation constant ( 50 \" M ( Fig . 2 ) . The ionic component of actin binding has been shown to be mediated by positive charges in surface loop - 2 of myosin ( 36 ) . Loop - 2 of myo1e is shorter than those found in other characterized myosins ( Fig . 10 B ) and does not contain the positively charged amino acids in the region that has been shown to be required for actin binding ( Fig . 10 B ( 36 ) ) . However , loop - 2 of myo1e contains the KK region ( Fig . 10 B , underlined ) shown to be crucial for actin activation of phos - phate release ( 37 ) . Therefore , it is possible that actin activates phosphate release from myo1e IQ , but we are not able to achieve high enough actin concentrations to populate the weakly bound AM ! ADP ! P i state . Weak actin binding may be a kinetic adap - tation required for cellular function ( see below ) . It is possible that phosphate release by myo1e IQ is uncoupled from actin binding , so the very high basal rate of P i release ( k \u2019 4 ) is also the rate when myo1e IQ is attached to actin ( k \u2019 4 \" ) . Why myo1e would evolve a mechanism that seemingly wastes ATP is not clear ; however , other mechanisms for the suppres - sion of the basal ATPase rate may exist . For example , the tail domain ( which is not present in myo1e IQ ) is thought to regulate the ATPase activity of myo1e allosterically ( 19 ) . Further exper - iments are required to determine whether the myo1e tail reg - ulates phosphate release directly . ADP Binding and Release \u2014 Time courses of mantADP bind - ing to myo1e IQ are best fit to two exponentials . The rate of the fast phase is hyperbolically related to the nucleotide concen - tration as expected for a two - step binding reaction ( Reaction 6 ) . The rate of the slow exponential does not show a significant nucleotide dependence and possibly reports the population of a second higher fluorescence state M ! ADP state , M $ ADP - | 0 1 / K 6 M ( ADP ) O \u00a1 k $ 5 a M ! ADP * O \u00a1 k $ 5b M ! ADP * * R EACTION 6 where * indicates the fluorescence state of myosin , k $ 5a is the maximum rate of the fast phase , and k $ 5b is the maximum rate of the slow fluorescence change . It has been shown previously that myosins exists in more than one ADP state ( 14 , 38 ) , so it is not surprising that we are able to detect multiple conforma - tions of myo1e IQ . Dissociation of mantADP in the absence of actin also shows two exponentials that are likely related to these two states . However , a more detailed analysis of ADP binding is required to characterize these states better . The similarity of the rates of P i release and ADP release in the absence of actin raises the possibility that the products are released simultaneously ( Table II ) . However , if ADP and P i were released together , steady - state measurements of v 0 would be ( 2 - fold faster ( see above ) . Time courses of mantADP binding to actomyo1e IQ fit single exponentials that are linearly related to the nucleotide concen - tration ( Fig . 9 A ) . A linear fit to the data does not pass through the origin but reveals a dissociation rate ( k \u2019 5 \" ) of ! 100 s $ 1 . This dissociation rate is nearly identical to the dissociation rate determined directly by displacing myo1e IQ - bound mantADP with unlabeled ATP ( Fig . 9 A , inset ) . The dissociation equilib - rium constant ( K 5 \" K 6 \" ) calculated by dividing the dissociation rate ( k \u2019 5 \" ) by the association rate ( k $ 5 \" / K 6 \" ) obtained from the mantADP experiments is within a factor of 2 of that deter - mined from the pyrene - actin fluorescence experiments . There - fore , it is unlikely that the mantADP experiments are reporting artifactually high rates as shown for dmantATP binding to actin ( see above ) . Comparison with Other Myosin - I \u2014 Myo1e is the first verte - brate subclass - 1 myosin - I to be characterized . Like the sub - class - 1 isoforms from Acanthamoeba ( 13 ) , myo1e has relatively F IG . 10 . Models for myo1e function . A , the predominant ATPase pathway of myo1e IQ under in vitro assay conditions is outlined . We propose that under cellular conditions , native myo1e follows the path - way proposed by Lymn and Taylor ( 43 ; gray shading ) . B , comparison of the loop - 2 regions of myosins isoforms .

Kinetic Mechanism of Myo1e 21520 a t U n i v e r s it y o f C a li f o r n i a , B e r k e l e y on A ugu s t 8 , 2019 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m large rate constants that are similar to those of skeletal muscle myosin - II ( Table II ) . Most notably , the rates of ADP release from all subclass - 1 isoforms are ( 10 - fold faster than subclass - 2 isoforms , i . e . the lifetimes of the AM ! ADP states are ( 10 longer for subclass - 2 isoforms ( 13 \u2013 16 ) . The rate of ADP release limits sliding velocity ( 39 ) , so we propose that subclass - 1 isoforms are better tuned for fast motility , whereas subclass - 2 isoforms are better tuned for maintenance of force ( 14 , 15 ) . A difference among the amoeba and vertebrate subclass - 1 isoforms is that Acanthamoeba myosin - IA and - IB have low basal ATPase rates ( + 0 . 1 s $ 1 ) and a large actin activation of the steady - state ATPase ( ( 50 - fold ( 40 ) ) , whereas myo1e has an high basal ATPase rate and a low actin activation ( Table I ) . Like myo1e , vertebrate subclass - 2 isoforms also have high ba - sal ATPase rates and relatively low actin activations ( 41 ) . This might be an adaptation to the cellular environment of verte - brate cells , or it might be related to the regulation of myosin - I in these cells ( 8 ) . A second difference between amoeba sub - class - 1 isoforms and myo1e is , like subclass - 2 isoforms , myo1e has a very high ADP affinity ( K 5 \" K 6 \" + 10 \" M ) . Therefore , it is possible that ADP release from both vertebrate subclasses is highly force - dependent ( 14 , 15 ) . Relevance of Myo1e Kinetics to in Vivo Function \u2014 Like all other characterized myosin - I isoforms ( 13 \u2013 16 ) , myo1e is a low duty ratio motor , so under unloaded conditions it is predomi - nantly weakly bound or detached from actin filaments . There - fore , for myole to support motility , a high effective duty ratio must be created by bringing together locally high concentra - tions of myosin and actin . Such a mechanism is consistent with its observed cellular localization in regions of high F - actin concentration ( 17 , 18 ) . The force - generating power stroke of myosin is thought to accompany phosphate release ( 42 ) . Therefore , an ATPase path - way in which phosphate is released while myosin is detached from the actin filament ( Fig . 10 A , outlined pathway ) would not generate force . It is possible that the power stroke occurs at a different step in the myo1e ATPase pathway ( e . g . ADP release ) ; however , this possibility is unlikely given the sequence and mechanistic conservation among myosin isoforms . We propose that the low actin affinity of myo1e in the presence of ATP is an adaptation to the high actin concentration environment in which myo1e functions ( 17 , 18 ) . Native myo1e cross - links actin filaments via an ATP - insensitive actin binding site in its tail , creating densely packed and cross - linked bundles ( 19 ) . If the weak binding states ( M ! ATP and M ! ADP ! P i ) of myo1e had a high actin affinity , then ATP hydrolysis and the recovery stroke would occur while attached to actin ( 30 ) . Therefore , an associated hydrolysis pathway would result in the reversal of myosin \u2019 s power stroke . To ensure that myo1e is detached from actin during the recovery stroke , a weak affinity must be maintained in the pre - force - generating states . We therefore predict that under the high actin concentrations of the cell , the M ! ADP ! P i state will bind and release phosphate while attached to actin ( Fig . 10 A , gray pathway ) as proposed for other myosins ( 43 ) . Further experiments are required to confirm this predic - tion and to understand better the unique kinetic adaptations of all vertebrate myosin - I isoforms .

McMahon 1 , * 1 Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology Hills Road Cambridge , CB2 0QH UK 2 Institute for Molecular Bioscience and Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis University of Queensland Brisbane , Queensland 4072 Australia Summary Clathrin - independent endocytosis is an umbrella term for a variety of endocytic pathways that internalize numerous cargoes independently of the canonical coat protein Clathrin [ 1 , 2 ] . Electron - microscopy studies have de\ufb01ned the pleio - morphic CL athrin - I ndependent C arriers ( CLICs ) and G PI - E nriched E ndocytic C ompartments ( GEECs ) as related ma - jor players in such uptake [ 3 , 4 ] . This CLIC / GEEC pathway relies upon cellular signaling and activation through small G proteins , but mechanistic insight into the biogenesis of its tubular and tubulovesicular carriers is lacking . Here we show that the Rho - GAP - domain - containing protein GRAF1 marks , and is indispensable for , a major Clathrin - indepen - dent endocytic pathway . This pathway is characterized by its ability to internalize bacterial exotoxins , GPI - linked pro - teins , and extracellular \ufb02uid . We show that GRAF1 localizes to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched , tubular , and punctate lipid struc - tures via N - terminal BAR and PH domains . These membrane carriers are relatively devoid of caveolin1 and \ufb02otillin1 but are associated with activity of the small G protein Cdc42 . This study provides the \ufb01rst speci\ufb01c noncargo marker for CLIC / GEEC endocytic membranes and demonstrates how GRAF1 can coordinate small G protein signaling and mem - brane remodeling to facilitate internalization of CLIC / GEEC pathway cargoes . Results and Discussion The protein G TPase R egulator A ssociated with F ocal Adhe - sion Kinase - 1 ( GRAF1 ) is predicted to comprise an N - terminal BAR domain , a PH domain , a RhoGAP domain , a proline - rich domain , and a C - terminal SH3 domain ( Figure 1A ) . GRAF1 ex - hibits GAP activity for the small G proteins RhoA and Cdc42 and has been shown to interact with the kinases FAK and PKN b [ 5 , 6 , 14 ] . The presence of a predicted BAR domain in GRAF1 suggests that it might function in membrane sculpting [ 7 ] . GRAF1 was found to be expressed in a variety of cell lines ( Figure S1A ) , and by immunocytochemistry we found that GRAF1 was predominantly localized to pleiomorphic tubular and punctate structures in HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells ( Figures 1B \u2013 1D and Figure S1B ) . Although GRAF1 can be found primar - ily on long tubules in some cells , other cells within the same population exhibit a predominantly punctate GRAF1 localiza - tion . GRAF1 - positive tubules are disrupted at low tempera - tures , and a 37 (cid:2) C \ufb01xation was required for their integrity to be preserved ( Figure S1C ) . Upon monitoring both GRAF1 lo - calization and endocytosis of either the plasma membrane marker DiI or the \ufb02uid - phase marker dextran by confocal mi - croscopy , we found that endocytic structures extensively co - localized with GRAF1 ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Colocalization of GRAF1 was even evident when only very early endocytic struc - tures were examined , indicative of an early endocytic role for GRAF1 - positive membranes ( Figure 1D ) . We then examined the turnover of GRAF1 - positive membranes with time by over - expressing GFP - tagged full - length GRAF1 in HeLa cells and examining its localization by using four - dimensional spin - ning - disc confocal microscopy . We found GRAF1 - positive tu - bular structures to be spectacularly dynamic ( Figure 1E and Movie S1 ) . By electron microscopy , we found that GRAF1 - labeled tubules were around 40 nm in diameter in vivo ( Figure 1G ) . We also found that overexpressed GFP - tagged GRAF1 BAR + PH protein ( missing the GAP , proline - rich , and SH3 domains ) also labeled tubular membranes that could accumulate DiI ( Figure 1F , Movie S2 , and data not shown ) . However , these tubules were much more static than those la - beled by overexpressed full - length GRAF1 , suggesting that GRAF1 BAR + PH might act in a dominant - negative manner to stabilize early endocytic tubules ( see also below ) . To examine the speci\ufb01c properties of the predicted lipid - binding region of GRAF1 , we performed lipid cosedimentation assays with puri\ufb01ed GRAF1 BAR + PH protein ( Figure 2A ) . Us - ing liposomes of varying diameter , we found that GRAF1 BAR + PH bound better to smaller ( more highly curved ) lipo - somes , consistent with the presence of a membrane - curva - ture - sensing BAR domain [ 7 ] . Furthermore , we examined the effects of mutating key lysine residues [ 7 ] in the BAR domain to glutamates ( KK131 / 132EE ) and found that this mutant was now cytoplasmically distributed ( Figure S1D ) . Expression of the BAR domain alone in cells resulted in a predominantly cy - toplasmic and sometimes punctate localization ( Figure S1E ) , suggesting that both the BAR and PH domains are necessary for tubular localization of GRAF1 . We therefore tested whether , in addition to a curvature - sensing or - generating capability , the GRAF1 BAR + PH unit has phosphoinositide - binding speci\ufb01city . GRAF1 BAR + PH protein was subjected to lipid cosedimentation assays with 10 % phosphatidylserine - con - taining liposomes with varying phosphoinositide composition ( Figure 2B ) . Greatest binding was observed for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched liposomes . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is plasma - membrane en - riched [ 8 ] , consistent with our observations that GRAF1 - asso - ciated traf\ufb01cking occurs from this site . GRAF1 BAR + PH protein was also capable of generating tubules in vitro from spherical liposomes as examined by electron microscopy * Correspondence : richard . lundmark @ medchem . umu . se ( R .

The diameter of these tubules was around 40 nm , consistent with the ob - served diameter of GRAF1 - positive tubules found in cells ( Figure 1G ) . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that the BAR and PH domains of GRAF1 function together to pro - duce and / or stabilize endocytic tubules in vivo . To identify interacting partners for GRAF1 , we immunopre - cipitated GRAF1 from rat brain cytosol . Interestingly , GRAF1 was found in a complex with the membrane scission protein Dynamin1 ( Figure 2D and S2A ) . We con\ufb01rmed binding to both Dynamin1 and Dynamin2 by using GST - tagged GRAF1 SH3 domain as bait in pull - down experiments against puri\ufb01ed Dynamin1 , brain cytosol , or HeLa cell lysate ( Figure 2E ; also Figures S2B and S2C ) . Monomeric GRAF1 SH3 domain was found to bind to a peptide from Dynamin1 proline - rich domain with a k d of 106 m M ( Figure S2D ) . Furthermore , treatment of HeLa cells with dynasore resulted in a profound reduction of tubular endocytosis in HeLa cells and a redistribution of GRAF1 to basally located puncta ( Figure S2E ) . These data , taken together with our observation that C - terminally trun - cated versions of GRAF1 ( lacking the SH3 domain ) are found on long static tubules , suggests that the complex between Dynamin and GRAF1 might function to regulate the scission and stability of these ordinarily pleiomorphic tubulovesicular structures . Clathrin polymers are rarely found on tubular membranes by electron microscopical techniques . Indeed , GRAF1 - positive tubules , and other GRAF1 - positive structures , were devoid of Clathrin and did not colocalize with internalized or internal - izing transferrin or the transferrin receptor , which is widely used as a marker for Clathrin - mediated endocytic events ( Fig - ures S3A \u2013 S3C ) . Alongside the canonical Clathrin - mediated en - docytic routes , other prevalent endocytic pathways coexist [ 1 , 2 ] . For example , the internalization of MHC class I proteins , many GPI - linked receptors , and bacterial exotoxins rely on traf\ufb01cking compartments with heretofore unde\ufb01ned coat com - ponents . The data presented above strongly suggest that GRAF1 might function as a coat within a prevalent Clathrin - independent endocytic pathway . To characterize further the nature of GRAF1 - positive tubules , we incubated GRAF1 - over - expressing HeLa cells with cholera toxin B subunit ( CTxB ) , a marker that is used for the study of Clathrin - independent en - docytic pathways but that also enters via Clathrin - mediated routes [ 9 ] . We found that internalized CTxB colocalized with Myc - GRAF1 - positive tubules in HeLa cells ( Figure 2F ) as well as with endogenous GRAF1 - positive structures after 5 min in - cubation at 37 (cid:2) C ( Figure 2G ) . In addition , we found that GRAF1 BAR + PH overexpression ( which leads to static tubules ; Figure 1F ) halved the number of cells internalizing CTxB with - out effecting transferrin uptake ( Figures S4A \u2013 S4C ) . We then followed CTxB and transferrin internalization in real time in NIH 3T3 cells ( almost all of which are capable of binding and internalizing CTxB ; cf . HeLa cells , which often lack its glyco - lipid receptor , GM1 ) . NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with constructs encoding either GFP - tagged GRAF1 or GRAF1 BAR + PH and incubated with CTxB and transferrin on ice be - fore stimulation of endocytosis by incubation of cells with pre - warmed ( 37 (cid:2) C ) media . Imaging commenced immediately ( Figure S4D and Movie S3 ) . Newly forming dynamic GRAF1 - positive tubules were shown to contain CTxB at extremely early stages of its internalization and were unassociated with internalizing / internalized transferrin . Furthermore , the more static , elongated GRAF1 BAR + PH - positive tubules maintained the presence of CTxB , again independently of transferrin , suggesting that here the toxin is trapped in structures that can - not undergo \ufb01ssion from the plasma membrane and progress further ( data not shown ) . Although GRAF1 - positive carriers resemble the previously characterized Arf6 - dependent structures that are responsible for uptake of MHC Class I proteins [ 10 ] , we found no evidence for overlap between these pathways . Neither GRAF1 - nor GRAF1 BAR + PH - positive tubules were found to contain endo - cytosed or recycled MHC class I proteins at 5 , 15 , or 45 min af - ter stimulation of their internalization when speci\ufb01c antibodies were used , and the amount of total MHC class I protein endo - cytosis was not altered upon overexpression of the dominant - negative GRAF1 BAR + PH construct ( Figures S6A and S6B and data not shown ) . In addition , the tubular localization of GRAF1 was independent of overexpression of wild - type Arf6 or dom - inant - active Arf6 ( Arf6Q67L ; data not shown ) . In contrast , Arf6 Q67L overexpression was found to completely block the inter - nalization of MHC class I molecules ( [ 11 ] and data not shown ) . Electron - microscopy studies , focusing on the uptake of CTxB and GPI - linked receptors , have suggested that a large portion of these proteins are internalized by Cl athrin - i ndepen - dent c arriers ( CLICs ) seemingly into G PI - AP - enriched e arly e n - dosomal c ompartments ( GEECs ) , together with \ufb02uid - phase markers such as dextran [ 4 ] . Our data have shown that GRAF1 - positive structures morphologically and functionally resemble the endocytic structures of this CLIC / GEEC endo - cytic pathway [ 4 ] . We therefore examined whether GRAF1 could regulate the internalization of a model GPI - linked protein known to undergo endocytosis into the CLIC / GEEC pathway . Consistent with this , we found by using immuno - electron microscopy that GRAF1 labeled GFP - GPI - positive tubules ( Figure 3A ) . We then examined the internalization of GFP - GPI in mouse embryonic \ufb01broblasts by binding anti - GFP anti - bodies and transferrin ( as a control ) to cells on ice and subse - quently moving these cells to 37 (cid:2) C for variable chase periods . We did this in both wild - type ( data not shown ) and caveolin1 - knockout mouse embryonic \ufb01broblasts ( to exclude caveolae - associated uptake ) that we transfected with either a Myc - tagged GRAF1 or a Myc - tagged GRAF1 BAR + PH construct and examined after cytosol washout ( Figure 3B ; note that washout treatment damages GRAF1 - positive membranes but is necessary for the objective quantitative analysis of co - localization of GRAF1 with internalized GFP - GPI because cy - toplasmic GRAF1 would otherwise result in overestimation of colocalization ) . GRAF1 was found to signi\ufb01cantly colocalize with internalized GFP - GPI ( 79 % colocalization ) but not trans - ferrin after a 2 min chase ( Figures 3B and 3C and data not shown ) . A reduced level of colocalization was seen after a 10 min chase ( 47 % ) , and even lower colocalization levels were observed after a 40 min chase ( when the protein is recy - cling back to the plasma membrane ; 23 % ) . These data are consistent with our previous observations , strongly suggest - ing a role for GRAF1 function in sculpting the highly curved membranes of the CLIC / GEEC endocytic pathway . In contrast , GRAF1 BAR + PH consistently colocalized with GFP - GPI after 2 min ( 60 % ) , 10 min ( 68 % ) , and 40 min ( 75 % ) chase periods , further supporting a role for this protein as a dominant - negative protein that traps early CLIC / GEEC carriers . To char - acterize this dominant - negative effect in greater detail , we examined the effect of GRAF1 BAR + PH protein on GFP - GPI in - ternalization ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Compared with GFP - GPI in - ternalization in the presence of GRAF1 , the total amount of GFP - GPI internalization was profoundly reduced in the pres - ence of GRAF1 BAR + PH ( to around 10 % of control levels ) , Membrane Sculpting in Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis 1803 Figure 1 .

The histogram represents standardized values of anti - GFP pixels . Error bars indicate the stan - dard errors of the mean . Current Biology Vol 18 No 22 1806 suggesting further that this protein traps cargoes in rather static early endocytic carriers that are incapable of undergoing \ufb01ssion from the plasma membrane . Importantly , the steady - state surface levels of GFP - GPI were indistinguishable be - tween cells expressing GRAF1 and those expressing GRAF1 BAR + PH ( Figure S6C ) . CTxB has been shown to be endocytosed via caveolin and \ufb02otillin - positive structures [ 12 ] . Although we did not \ufb01nd cav - eolin1 or \ufb02otillin1 in GRAF1 - positive structures at steady state by \ufb02uorescence microscopy ( Figures S5A and S5B ) , stabiliza - tion of early GRAF1 - positive carriers by GRAF1 BAR + PH over - expression caused \ufb02otillin1 , and to a lesser extent caveolin1 , to be found in such regions with CTxB ( Figures S5C and S5D ) , suggesting that these membrane regions can communi - cate with the CLIC / GEEC pathway . Uptake through the CLIC / GEEC endocytic pathway has pre - viously been shown to be Cdc42 dependent [ 3 ] . Consistent with this , we observed that overexpressed dominant - active Cdc42 protein colocalizes with GRAF1 in basally located puncta ( Figure 3D ) . The absence of Cdc42 in long tubular structures might suggest that the role of Cdc42 in this pathway is restricted spatially and temporarily to the earlier endocytic stages or that progression is blocked through the dominant - active construct , which would be expected to have pleiotropic effects . To determine whether GRAF1 was necessary for endocyto - sis , we depleted GRAF1 levels by using siRNA . This treatment was capable of reducing the amount of GRAF1 to background levels as assessed by immunocytochemistry and immunoblot - ting of HeLa cells and their lysates , respectively ( Figure 4A ; also Figure S6D ) . GRAF1 - depleted cells were assessed for their ability to endocytose dextran ( allowing assessment of total endocytic capacity ) , both by epi\ufb02uorescence microscopy and by a quantitative \ufb02uorimetric assay ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . GRAF1 depletion resulted in a 50 % \u2013 60 % reduction of total dextran endocytosis , similar to that observed upon depletion of AP2 , the major Clathrin adaptor at the plasma membrane ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that GRAF1 - mediated endocytosis and Clathrin - mediated endocytosis account for roughly equal amounts of volume internalization in these cells . GRAF1 - depleted cells had no observable defects in their ability to en - docytose transferrin ( Figure 4D ) , demonstrating that GRAF1 is not necessary for Clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In this study we have shown that GRAF1 is found on tubular and vesicular membranes in vivo , and that these membranes de\ufb01ne a prevalent Clathrin - independent endocytic pathway . This endocytic pathway is capable of internalizing Cholera toxin , GPI - linked proteins , and large amounts of extracellular \ufb02uid , and it corresponds ( at least in part ) to the CLIC / GEEC en - docytic pathway .

Scale bars represent 10 m m . Membrane Sculpting in Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis 1807 ARHGAP10 , is necessary for uptake via the CLIC / GEEC path - way , and Arf1 activity modulation also interferes with Cdc42 dynamics , suggesting interplay between these proteins [ 13 ] . Indeed , GRAF1 is capable of downregulating the activity of Cdc42 [ 14 ] , which is known to be necessary for the CLIC / GEEC pathway [ 3 ] and which colocalizes with GRAF1 in vivo . The protein machinery responsible for the biogenesis and pro - cessing of CLIC / GEEC endocytic membranes is largely un - known . Although Dynamin certainly plays a role in CLIC / GEEC membrane processing ( it is necessary for delivery of CTxB to the Golgi apparatus [ 4 ] ) , its precise role in the CLIC / GEEC pathway is uncertain . Recent microinjection experi - ments with antibodies directed against speci\ufb01c isoforms of Dynamin , or with siRNAs directed against these , showed that Dynamin is involved in constitutive \ufb02uid - phase uptake and suggested that it might play an important role in high - vol - ume Clathrin - independent endocytic events [ 15 ] . We build on this work by showing that there exists a tight biochemical in - teraction between GRAF1 and Dynamin . Although we impli - cate Dynamin in this pathway , precisely determining whether it functions here in an analogous manner to Dynamin at Cla - thrin - coated pits or works via a noncanonical mechanism will require further work . Our experiments lead us to suggest that GRAF1 coordinates the highest volume Clathrin - independent endocytic pathway in HeLa cells . Although several Clathrin - independent endo - cytic pathways appear to coexist ( such pathways include cav - eolin1 - and \ufb02otillin1 - positive pathways , an Arf6 - associated tu - bular uptake pathway , and the CLIC / GEEC pathway ) , the precise contributions that each of these pathways makes to constitutive endocytosis , and the interrelationships between these pathways , are uncertain . Although we have found that GRAF1 - positive membranes contain little \ufb02otillin1 or caveolin1 at steady state , we have also shown that these membranes probably transiently communicate . We further show that GRAF1 - positive membranes are not associated with internal - izing or recycled MHC class I proteins . Taken together , our data link biochemical and cell biological observations to iden - tify the \ufb01rst important modulator of membrane curvature in a highly prevalent Clathrin - independent endocytic pathway . We believe that , in the context of our \ufb01ndings , study of Cla - thrin - independent endocytic pathways will reveal new layers of complexity underlying lipid and protein cargo selection , ap - propriate intracellular traf\ufb01cking of endocytic membranes , and the mechanisms of endocytic intermediate formation by mem - brane deformation and membrane - curvature stabilization .

GRAF2 SH3 domain was amplified similarly from IMAGE clone 6188298 and cloned into the pGEX - 4T - 2 vector . Fragments were also cloned into the pCMVmyc vector with added Not1 site ( a kind gift from JGW Anderson ) or EGFP - C3 ( Clontech ) for mammalian expression . Amino acid substitutions K131E , K132E and R412D were created using PCR directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) . The GFP - tagged Cdc42 L61 consrtruct was a kind gift from M .

Protein expression , protein purification and antibodies Recombinant proteins were expressed in a BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS E - coli strain as Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion proteins and purified using glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) and gel filtration on a sephacryl S - 200 column ( Amersham ) as previously described [ 1 ] . Polyclonal antisera against GRAF1 were generated by immunising Rabbits ( Ra83 / Ab1 directed against the SH3 domain ; Ra84 / Ab2 directed against the PH + GAP domains ; and RaZ1 / Ab3 directed against the full length protein ; all of these were used for Western blotting analyses , and Ab1 / 3 also used for immunofluorescence analyses ) and a chicken ( CH - 9798 / Ab4 , directed against the full length protein , used for immunofluorescence analyses ) with recombinantly expressed human GRAF1 proteins . Purchased antibodies were : mouse anti - myc clone 9E10 , mouse anti - tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , Rabbit anti - myc ( Cell Signalling Technology ) , mouse anti - Dynamin , ( BD Transduction Laboratories ) , Rabbit anti - synaptojanin Ra59 [ 1 ] , ( Affinity Bioreagents ) . All secondary antibodies and streptavidins were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 , 546 or 647 ( Invitrogen ) . Expression , immunoprecipitation and pull down experiments For analysis of endogenous protein expression , cell lines were grown according to instructions from American Tissue Culture Collection , harvested and lysed in 1 % NP - 40 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors . After a 20 , 000g centrifugation the supernatant was analysed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . For immunoprecipitation experiments , rat brain cytosol was generated by homogenization of rat brains in buffer ( 25mM HEPES , 150mM NaCl , 1mM DTT , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitors ) , before centrifugation at 50 , 000rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C . The supernatant was removed and added to protein A Sephorose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciensis ) to which antibodies had been previously bound and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 3 hours . Beads were washed three times in buffer ( 25mM HEPES , 150mM NaCl ) supplemented Current Biology Volume 18 2 with 1 % NP - 40 , and once in buffer without NP - 40 before analysis by SDS - PAGE combined with immunoblotting or Coomassie staining . Pull - down experiments against rat brain cytosol using purified proteins and identification by mass - spectrometry were performed as previously described [ 1 ] . Protein and lipid interaction assays Liposomes from total brain lipids ( FOLCH fraction I ) ( Sigma Aldrich ) or synthetic lipids ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) , and liposomes of a specified diameter or phosphoinositide enrichment were generated as previously described [ 2 ] . Liposome binding assays for lipid specificity and curvature sensitivity was performed as previously described [ 2 ] . Briefly , proteins were incubated together with liposomes followed by centrifugation and analysis of the pellet and supernatant by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . In vitro liposome tubulation assays were performed and analysed as previously described [ 2 ] . Isothermal titration calorimetry The binding of synthetic peptides from Dynamin1 to purified GRAF1 SH3 domain was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) using a VP - ITC ( MicroCal Inc . , USA ) . All experiments were performed in 100mM HEPES / NaOH pH 7 . 4 , 50mM NaCl and 2mM DTT at 10\u00b0C . Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280nm . 1 . 36ml of 51\u00b5M GRAF1 SH3 domain was loaded into the cell . The peptides ( at 1mM which were custom - designed and manufactured at the Institute of Biomolecular Sciences , University of Southampton , UK ) were injected from a syringe in 5\u00b5l steps every 3 . 5 minutes . The heat of the dilution of the ligand was subtracted from the data prior to fitting . Titration curves were fitted to the data using the ORIGIN program ( MicroCal Inc . ) which yielded the stoichiometry ( ~ 1 ) , the binary association constant K a ( = K d - 1 ) and the enthalpy of binding . The entropy of binding ( \u2206 S\u00b0 ) was calculated from the relationship \u2206 G\u00b0 = - RT \u2022 ln ( K a ) and the Gibbs - Helmholtz equation . Cell culture and transfections HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 or MEM media ( GIBCO ) supplemented with LGlutamine , 10 % foetal bovine serum , non - essential amino acids ( for MEM ) , and transfected using Genejuice ( Novagen ) for transient protein expression . For primary cultures , rat hippocampal neurons / astrocytes were prepared by trypsin digestion and mechanical trituration from E18 or P1 Sprague - Dawley rats and plated onto poly L - lysine coated coverslips . Cells were cultured in B27 - supplemented Neurobasal media . For GRAF1 depletion , HeLa cells were transfected with Stealth siRNAs specific against human GRAF1 using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturers instructions . The Invitrogen siRNA duplex sequences used were siRNAa ( UUA UCU CCC AUU CAG CAC AGA UAU C / GAU AUC UGU GCU GAA UGG GAG AUA A ) , and siRNAb ( UUU GAA ACU GGU ACA UCA UGA GUG G / CCA CUC AUG AUG UAC CAG UUU CAA A ) . Cells were cultured for an additional 48 hours for efficient silencing of the GRAF1 expression . Stealth Block - it siRNA ( Invitrogen ) was used as a control . AP2 siRNA was used as previously described [ 3 ] . Caveolin - 1 knock - out mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( KO MEFs ) were generated and grown as previously described [ 4 ] . NIH 3T3 cells were cultured as per ECACC guidelines . Trafficking assays For immunofluorescence trafficking assays , biotinylated holo - transferrin , ( Sigma Aldrich ) , Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) , Alexa Fluor 546 / 555 - conjugated CTxB ( Invitrogen ) , DiI ( Invitrogen ) , FITC - dextran ( 10kDa MW , used for fluorimetric uptake assay , Invitrogen ) , and biotinylated dextran ( 10kDa MW , used for immunofluorescent uptake assays , Invitrogen ) , were diluted in pre - warmed media , added to cells and incubated for time periods and temperatures as described in figure legends . After washing , cells were fixed and subjected to Current Biology Volume 18 3 immunofluorescence analysis as described below . For quantitative analysis of dextran endocytosis , HeLa cells in 35mm dishes were transfected with siRNAs / control siRNAs 48 hours prior to the experiment . Fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - dextran ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was diluted in media to a concentration of 1mg / ml and added to cells before incubation for 15 minutes at the indicated temperature . Cells were washed twice in media and once in PBS before lysis in 1 % NP - 40 in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors . The lysate was centrifuged at 20 , 000g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Pierce ) for normalization . The amount of FITC - dextran in the supernatant was measured as the emission at 515nm after exciting at 488nm using a FP - 6500 spectrofluorometer with Spectra Manager software ( JASCO ) . The MHC Class I uptake assay was performed according to reference [ 5 ] . Briefly , HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP - tagged GRAF1 or GRAF1 BAR + PH for 16 hours were incubated with W6 / 32 anti - MHC Class I antibody ( American Type Culture Collection ) diluted in culture media for 5 or 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow endocytosis . Cells were washed in PBS and surface - bound antibody was removed by a 30 second acid wash followed by a wash in culture media to re - adjust the pH . Cells were fixed and MHC Class I was visualised using Alexa568 - conjugated antibodies . Fixed sample and real time imaging For immunofluorescence analysis , HeLa cells were fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C ( to preserve intracellular tubules which are disrupted by fixation at lower temperatures ) , or 4\u00b0C ( to demonstrate this temperature dependence ) , then washed and blocked in 5 % goat serum , with 0 . 1 % saponin , in PBS before staining with the appropriate antibodies in 1 % goat serum , 0 . 1 % saponin in PBS using standard protocols . Confocal images were taken sequentially using a BioRad Radiance system and LaserSharp software ( BioRad ) . Epifluorescence images were taken using a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 system with AxioVision software . For real time microscopy of the dynamics of GRAF1 - and GRAF1 BAR + PH - positive tubules , transfected cells on glass - bottom Petri dishes ( WillCo Wells BV , Amsterdam ) were washed with buffer ( 125mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 10mM D - glucose , 1mM MgCl2 , 2mM CaCl2 and 25mM HEPES ) and images were taken using a 5 - live scanning microscope ( Zeiss ) or spinning disc confocal system ( Improvision ) with subsequent analysis in LSM Image Browser ( Zeiss ) , ImageJ ( freeware ) or Volocity ( Improvision ) . Caveolin1 - KO MEFs and control MEFs grown on 12mm coverslips were cotransfected with GFP - GPI and myc - tagged GRAF1 or GRAF1 BAR + PH . Anti - GFP was bound to cells on ice for 30 minutes in unsupplemented CO2 - independent medium ( Gibco ) . Cells were washed in CO2 - independent medium to remove unbound antibody prior to internalization in pre - warmed growth media ( 10 % foetal bovine serum ( Cambrix ) , 2mM L - glutamine in DMEM ( Gibco ) ) at 37\u00b0C , 5 % CO2 for 2 , 10 or 40 minutes . Post internalization , cells were washed in ice - cold CO2 - independent medium and acid stripped using 500mM glycine pH2 . 2 in ice cold PBS for 1 minute . To remove intensive cytosolic labeling , acid - stripped live cells were permeablized in ice - cold PBS containing 0 . 05 % saponin ( Sigma ) for 5 minutes . Cells were washed 2 x 1 minute in ice cold PBS before fixation in 2 % paraformaldehyde . Internalized anti - GFP was labeled with Alexa Fluor - 660 - conjugated goat anti - Rabbit secondary antibody . Myc - tagged GRAF1 FL or BAR + PH was labeled with anti - myc ( 9B11 ) primary and Alexa - Fluor - 555 goat - anti mouse secondary antibodies . Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using an Axiovert 200m SP LSM 510 META confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Zeiss ) . Images were captured under oil with a 63x plan - APOCHROMAT objective , at appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths . Images were processed using Adobe Current Biology Volume 18 4 Photoshop CS2 . Quantification of anti - GFP and GRAF1 / GRAF1 BAR + PH colocalization was carried out using Volocity 3 . 7 . 0 . In brief , target cells were cropped and blue and red channels overlaid to generate a colocalization coefficient based on a percentage of blue voxels that identify with red voxels . Background was subtracted using the automatic threshold feature . Five to seven images across three independent experiments were used to calculate average colocalization and standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Relative pixel numbers of anti - GFP in each image was calculated in Adobe Photoshop CS2 based on the histogram of each image . For real - time endocytosis experiments , NIH 3T3 cells grown in 35mmM glass bottom dishes were transfected with GFP - tagged GRAF1 or GRAF1 BAR + PH constructs . Cells were washed in ice - cold CO2 - independent medium before binding Alexa Fluor - 555 - conjugated CTxB and / or Alexa Fluor - 647 - conjugated transferrin for 30 minutes on ice . Appropriate cells were identified using an Axiovert 200m SP LSM 510 META confocal laser - scanning microscope in ice - cold CO2 - independent medium . Medium was exchanged for prewarmed CO2 - independent medium plus 10 % heat - inactivated Serum Supreme and images captured using Lasersharp 2000 4 . 0 . Frames were captured every 10 seconds for 50 - 100 frames . Images were processed using Image J v1 . 37 and converted to Quicktime files . Supplemental References 1 . Praefcke , G .

Activation of PI - 3 - OH kinase and subsequent PIP 3 production activates Rac through PIP 3 binding to Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Rickert et al . , 2000 ; Chung et al . , 2001 ) . PIP 3 is a lipid compo - nent of the cell membrane , and Rac is integrated into the mem - brane via lipid modifi cation ( Hall , 1998 ) . Therefore , the site of action downstream of PIP 3 and Rac should be the membrane . WAVE2 belongs to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family of proteins , which activate the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex to stimulate signal - induced actin polymerization . Five WASP family proteins have been identi - fi ed , and WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and neural WASP ( N - WASP ) are expressed ubiquitously ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ; Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ) . Studies of cells from WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and N - WASP knockout mice have shown that WAVE2 is the protein that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex downstream of the small GTPase Rac ( Snapper et al . , 2001 ; Suetsugu and Takenawa , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) . We have reported that WAVE2 is a PIP 3 - binding protein , although PIP 3 alone was not involved in regu - lating the ability of WAVE2 to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . A large protein complex has been proposed to suppress WAVE1 activity by trans - inhibition in which a trimeric protein complex , including PIR121 / Sra1 , Nap1 , and Abi , binds to WAVE1 and suppresses WAVE1 activity ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . WAVE2 also forms a large protein complex including HSPC300 , Abi1 , Nap1 , and Sra1 / PIR121 ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Studies of cultured cells have shown that Sra1 , Nap1 , and Abi are involved in stabilizing WAVE2 ; the knockdown of Abi1 , Nap1 , or Sra1 results in decreased amounts of all of the proteins in the WAVE2 complex ( Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Among proteins in the WAVE2 complex , Abi1 and HSPC300 bind directly to the NH 2 - terminal Optimization of WAVE2 complex \u2013 induced actin polymerization by membrane - bound IRSp53 , PIP 3 , and Rac Shiro Suetsugu , 1 , 2 Shusaku Kurisu , 1 , 2 Tsukasa Oikawa , 1 , 2 Daisuke Yamazaki , 1 , 2 Atsushi Oda , 3 and Tadaomi Takenawa 1 , 2 1 Department of Biochemistry , Institute of Medical Science , University of Tokyo , Minato - ku , Tokyo 108 - 8639 , Japan 2 Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology , Japan Science and Technology Corporation , Kawaguchi 332 - 0012 , Japan 3 Laboratory of Environmental Biology , Department of Preventive Medicine , Hokkaido University School of Medicine , Kitaku , Sapporo 060 - 8638 , Japan W AVE2 activates the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex for Rac - induced actin polymer - ization during lamellipodium formation and exists as a large WAVE2 protein complex with Sra1 / PIR121 , Nap1 , Abi1 , and HSPC300 . IRSp53 binds to both Rac and Cdc42 and is proposed to link Rac to WAVE2 . We found that the knockdown of IRSp53 by RNA interference decreased lamellipodium formation without a decrease in the amount of WAVE2 complex . Localization of WAVE2 at the cell periphery was retained in IRSp53 knockdown cells . Moreover , activated Cdc42 but not Rac weakened the association between WAVE2 and IRSp53 . When we measured Arp2 / 3 activation in vitro , the WAVE2 complex isolated from the membrane fraction of cells was fully active in an IRSp53 - dependent manner but WAVE2 isolated from the cytosol was not . Puri\ufb01 ed WAVE2 and puri\ufb01 ed WAVE2 complex were activated by IRSp53 in a Rac - dependent manner with PIP 3 - containing liposomes . Therefore , IRSp53 optimizes the activity of the WAVE2 complex in the presence of activated Rac and PIP 3 .

WHD - mediated association with Abi1 / 2 also contributes to the localization of WAVE2 at the leading edge of lamellipodia ( Leng et al . , 2005 ) . However , purifi ed HSPC300 , Abi1 , Nap1 , and Sra1 / PIR121 do not suppress the activity of WAVE2 purifi ed from a baculovirus system ( Gautreau et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , trans - inhibition does not appear to occur with WAVE2 purifi ed from baculovirus . The activity of the native WAVE2 complex has yet to be examined . A WAVE2 - binding protein that is not included in the aforementioned protein complex is IRSp53 / BAIAP2 / Bap2 \u03b1 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . The Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of IRSp53 binds to WAVE2 , and the NH 2 - terminal Rac - binding ( RCB ) domain ( residues 1 \u2013 228 ) binds to Rac ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Choi et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , IRSp53 might be the link between Rac and WAVE2 that is involved in lamellipodium formation . The NH 2 - terminal region of IRSp53 ( residues 1 \u2013 250 ) , including the RCB domain , is termed the IRSp53 / missing in metastasis homology domain ( IMD ) . The IMD possesses actin fi lament bundling activity , and the overexpression of IRSp53 induces microspike / fi lopodium formation ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Millard et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , Cdc42 does not bind to the RCB domain but binds to the Cdc42 \u2013 Rac interactive binding motif between the RCB and SH3 domains ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . These fi ndings have not been reconciled , and the role of IRSp53 in actin cytoskeletal reorganization remains to be clarifi ed . In this study , we investigated the activity of the WAVE2 complex purifi ed from various cellular preparations and exam - ined the contributions of WAVE2 - binding proteins to the regu - lation of WAVE2 downstream of Rac . Results Localization of WAVE2 and IRSp53 To purify the WAVE2 complex from cultured cells , we sta - bly expressed WAVE2 tagged with FLAG in A431 cells . The amount of WAVE2 in the FLAG - WAVE2 \u2013 expressing cell line was approximately twice that of control vector \u2013 transfected cells ( Fig . S1 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . This cell line and the control cell line were used throughout this study . WAVE2 in FLAG - WAVE2 \u2013 expressing cells was localized similar to WAVE2 in control A431 cells ( Fig . S1 A ) . A signifi cant portion of endogenous WAVE2 localized at cell \u2013 cell junctions and lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 A ) . In cells with decreased Abi1 expression by RNAi , the amount of WAVE2 was signifi cantly decreased in FLAG - WAVE2 \u2013 expressing cells , indicating that tagged WAVE2 under stable expression behaved similarly to endogenous WAVE2 ( Fig . 1 C ) . WAVE2 tagged with GFP did not localize properly in the absence of Abi1 , but it localized in a manner similar to endogenous WAVE2 in the presence of Abi1 as reported previ - ously , indicating that Abi1 is essential for the localization of WAVE2 ( Fig . 1 B ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ; Leng et al . , 2005 ) . We previously identifi ed IRSp53 as a WAVE2 - binding pro - tein . The presence of IRSp53 splice variants was indicated by the presence of IRSp53 bands at two positions on the Western blot . IRSp53 was also localized at cell \u2013 cell junctions and lamelli - podia ( Fig . 1 A ) . In cells with decreased IRSp53 expression , the amount of WAVE2 , Abi1 , Nap1 , or Sra1 in whole cell lysates was not altered ( Fig . 1 C ) , and WAVE2 remained at the cell pe - riphery ( Fig . 1 A ) . The amount of Abi in the WAVE2 protein complex was not signifi cantly altered by IRSp53 knockdown ( Fig . S1 B ) , as indicated by immunoprecipitation with anti - FLAG antibody . IRSp53 participates in lamellipodia formation In cells subjected to IRSp53 RNAi , lamellipodium formation in response to EGF treatment or expression of constitutively active ( CA ) Rac ( Rac CA ) was signifi cantly decreased ( Figs . 1 A and 2 , A and B ) . Time - lapse analysis confi rmed the decrease in lamellipodium formation , especially the speed of extension at the leading edge of cells treated with IRSp53 RNAi ( Fig . 1 D and Video 1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . The reduction in speed of the extension of cells treated with Abi1 RNAi was more drastic than of cells treated with IRSp53 RNAi ( Fig . 1 D and Video 1 ) . A similar protein , insulin receptor tyrosine kinase sub - strate ( IRTKS ) , was also found in A431 cells by RT - PCR analy - sis ( Fig . S1 B ) . RNAi for IRTKS was performed in A431 cells , and specifi c decreases in mRNA were observed for IRTKS ( Fig . S1 B ) . However , the reduction of IRTKS did not affect ruffl e formation ( Fig . 1 A ) . We then examined whether IRSp53 is essential for ruffl e formation in fi broblasts . Mouse embryonic fi broblasts ( MEFs ) from WAVE2 knockout mice were used . The expression of full - length ( wild type ) WAVE2 restored ruffl e formation upon the expression of Rac CA , but the expression of \u2206 PR WAVE2 with a deleted proline - rich region ( IRSp53 - binding region ) or of \u2206 WHD WAVE2 with a deleted WHD region ( Abi1 - binding region ) did not ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . The A5 mutant of WAVE2 ( defective in binding to PIP 3 ; Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) also failed to restore ruffl e formation ( Fig . S2 ) . Importantly , \u2206 PR WAVE2 localized at the cell periphery , whereas \u2206 WHD WAVE2 did not . Consistent with the localization of WAVE2 at the cell periphery in IRSp53 RNAi A431 cells ( Fig . 1 A ) , IRSp53 was not essen - tial for the localization of WAVE2 . In MEFs , ruffl e formation was severely impaired by Abi1 RNAi ( Fig . S2 and Video 2 ) . IRSp53 RNAi caused a decrease of ruffl e formation and exten - sion speed of the leading edge , indicating the involvement of IRSp53 in ruffl e formation in fi broblasts ( Fig . S2 and Video 2 ) . Negative regulation of WAVE2 \u2013 IRSp53 association by Cdc42 Because IRSp53 binds to both Rac and Cdc42 , we examined the interaction between IRSp53 and WAVE2 upon the expression of CA mutants . In the presence of Cdc42 CA , the interaction was signifi cantly decreased ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . In contrast , the inter - action between IRSp53 and WAVE2 was not signifi cantly per - turbed by Rac CA expression ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . The interaction between purifi ed WAVE2 and purifi ed IRSp53 was also de - creased in the presence of GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Cdc42 but not in the D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / r up r e ss . o r g / j c b / a r t i c l e - pd f / 173 / 4 / 571 / 1874880 / 571 . pd f b y U n i v e r s i t y O f W a s h i ng t on u s e r on 17 A ugu s t 2023 WAVE2 COMPLEX FROM THE CYTOSOL AND MEMBRANE \u2022 SUETSUGU ET AL . 573 presence of Rac ( Fig . 2 E ) . Therefore , Cdc42 appears to nega - tively regulate the binding of IRSp53 to WAVE2 . Enrichment of IRSp53 at the membrane and translocation of some WAVE2 to the membrane upon stimulation We fractionated cells and examined the subcellular localization of proteins by conventional ultracentrifugation ( Fig . 3 A ) . All of the proteins analyzed were found in all cell fractions , including the cytosol , membrane , and nucleus ( unpublished data ) . WAVE2 was somewhat enriched in the membrane fraction ; the mem - brane fraction contained 30 % more WAVE2 than the cytosol fraction . Abi1 was much more enriched in the membrane frac - tion , as the membrane fraction contained approximately twice that of the cytosol fraction . Most IRSp53 was present in the membrane fraction , as it contained four times that of the cytosol fraction ( Fig . 3 A ) . We then examined whether ruffl e - inducing stimuli could translocate WAVE2 from the cytosol and nucleus to the membrane . Upon EGF treatment , the amount of WAVE2 in the membrane fraction was increased 17 % ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . When Rac CA was expressed , the amount of WAVE2 in the membrane fraction in - creased 26 % ( Fig . 3 B ) . However , when dominant - negative ( DN ) Rac ( Rac DN ) was expressed , the amount of WAVE2 in the membrane fraction decreased 16 % ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) . The expression of Cdc42 CA also decreased the membrane localiza - tion of WAVE2 ( Fig . 3 D and S1 E ) . WAVE2 in the cytosol frac - tion was not signifi cantly reduced in response to these stimuli , presumably because of the presence of nuclear WAVE2 trans - located to the cytosol , as shown by antibody staining of the cells ( unpublished data ) . Thus , ruffl e - inducing stimuli induced the translocation of some WAVE2 to the membrane ( Fig . 3 E ) . We then examined the contribution of IRSp53 to the membrane lo - calization of WAVE2 . When we knocked down IRSp53 by RNAi , the amount of WAVE2 at the membrane decreased by 30 \u2013 40 % ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) . WAVE2 was not involved in the membrane lo - calization of IRSp53 because RNAi of WAVE2 did not have an effect on the amount of IRSp53 in the membrane ( Fig . 3 E ) . Figure 1 .

We purifi ed WAVE2 complex from the cytosolic fraction ; however , we were unable to resolubilize the pelleted membrane fraction . Therefore , we purifi ed the WAVE2 complex from cell lysates , including the membrane fraction , with Triton X - 100 . Thus , WAVE2 complex from the Triton X - 100 fraction contained cytosolic and membrane WAVE2 at a ratio of (cid:6) 1 : 1 . 3 ( Fig . 3 A ) . Examination of the proteins in the WAVE2 complex in the Triton X - 100 fraction by Western blotting showed the pres - ence of Abi1 and IRSp53 , as reported previously ( Fig . 4 A ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Abi1 also exists as several isoforms and splice variants , and several bands were identifi ed . EGF stimulation induces the phosphor - ylation of WAVE2 ( Miki et al . , 1999 ) . However , signifi cant alterations in the amounts of Abi1 and IRSp53 in WAVE2 immuno precipitates were not observed in response to EGF stim - ulation . Specifi c binding of IRSp53 and Abi to WAVE2 was con - fi rmed in experiments with vector - transfected cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Figure 2 .

Three independent experiments were performed . ( E ) GST fusion protein of WAVE2 was immobilized , and puri\ufb01 ed IRSp53 was incubated with GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Rac or Cdc42 .

Proteins coeluted with WAVE2 did not differ signifi cantly in response to EGF stimulation . Because WAVE2 in the mem - brane was increased only 17 % upon EGF stimulation ( Fig . 3 ) , a lack of difference in the WAVE2 complex before and after stimulation may be reasonable . The expression of Rac CA or Rac DN also did not cause signifi cant change in the WAVE2 complex ( unpublished data ) . Mass spectrometry and Western blotting identifi ed PIR121 / Sra1 , Nap1 / p125NckAP1 , and Abi1 / Abi2 / E3B1 in all WAVE2 complex preparations as reported previously ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ; unpub - lished data ) . We also identifi ed IRSp53 comigrating with Abi1 and IgG in the Triton X - 100 fraction only by SDS - PAGE inde - pendently of EGF stimulation ( Fig . 4 B , bottom ) . From the band intensity in Coomassie brilliant blue \u2013 stained gels ( unpublished data ) , the molar ratio of Abi , Nap1 , or Sra1 to FLAG - WAVE2 was determined to be (cid:6) 0 . 5 \u2013 0 . 6 ( Fig . 4 C ) , suggesting the presence of monomeric WAVE2 upon FLAG - WAVE2 expression . Importantly , the amounts of PIR121 / Sra1 , Nap1 , and Abi in the WAVE2 complex were consistently inde - pendent of stimuli or subcellular localization , indicating stable formation of the WAVE2 complex . The band corresponding to IRSp53 was not apparent in silver - stained gels ; there was no apparent difference in band in - tensities between the Triton X - 100 and the cytosolic WAVE2 complex in silver - stained gels despite the detection of IRSp53 only in the Triton X - 100 fraction by Western blotting . The mo - lar ratio of IRSp53 to WAVE2 in the Triton X - 100 fraction of purifi ed WAVE2 complex from cells was 0 . 0005 by quantitative Western blotting with standard proteins purifi ed from baculo - virus ( unpublished data ) . Because the ratio of cytosolic to mem - brane WAVE2 was 1 . 3 , the molar ratio of IRSp53 to WAVE2 in the membrane was estimated to be 0 . 001 , suggesting a transient interaction between IRSp53 and WAVE2 . Measurement of the binding constant and the intracellular concentrations of WAVE2 and IRSp53 Abi1 and IRSp53 bind to WAVE2 via the coiled - coil region of Abi1 and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Echarri et al . , 2004 ) .

We then measured the intracellular concentration of WAVE2 or IRSp53 by quantitative Western blotting with puri - fi ed WAVE2 or IRSp53 as standards . WAVE2 concentration in whole cell lysates was 30 \u2013 50 nM , whereas that of IRSp53 was 150 \u2013 300 nM . Given the Kd of 5 . 7 \u03bc M for WAVE2 and IRSp53 , only 2 . 5 nM WAVE2 was associated with IRSp53 in solution at WAVE2 and IRSp53 concentrations of 50 and 300 nM , respec - tively . Therefore , the Kd value between IRSp53 and WAVE2 suggests that these two proteins associate with the aid of other molecules such as Rac or PIP 3 or in a restricted location such as the cell membrane . Even if WAVE2 and IRSp53 associate under limited situations , the 10 - fold difference in Kd values appears to explain the lesser amount of IRSp53 in the aforementioned purifi ed WAVE2 complex . Three washes in 10 - fold volumes of buffer will result in a 1 , 000 - fold difference in protein amount . Similar activity of the WAVE2 complex to that of the WAVE2 monomer Most WAVE2 molecules are reported to complex with Sra1 / PIR121 , Nap1 , and Abi1 . We fractionated lysates of control A431 cells or cells expressing FLAG - tagged WAVE2 in a 3 \u2013 30 % sucrose gradient . Most of the WAVE2 in control cells formed a protein complex , but a small population of monomeric WAVE2 was found ( Fig . 5 A ) . Approximately half of the WAVE2 in cells stably expressing FLAG - WAVE2 was monomeric and not asso - ciated with Abi1 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Therefore , the presence of mono - meric WAVE2 in cells expressing FLAG - WAVE2 is caused by the ectopic expression of WAVE2 . We also created a WAVE2 knockout MEF cell line stably expressing FLAG - WAVE2 in Figure 4 . WAVE2 complex puri\ufb01 ed from A431 cells . ( A ) FLAG - tagged WAVE2 was immunoprecipitated from A431 cells stably expressing FLAG - WAVE2 or from control vec - tor \u2013 transfected cells by FLAG af\ufb01 nity immuno - precipitation ( IP ) .

The Triton X - 100 fraction indicates WAVE2 from both the cytosol and membrane fractions , and the cytosol fraction indicates WAVE2 from the cytosol fraction alone .

Most of the WAVE2 in WAVE2 knockout cells express - ing FLAG - WAVE2 formed a complex ( Fig . 5 C ) in a manner similar to wild - type cells ( unpublished data ) . In all of the lysates we prepared , IRSp53 was not coeluted with WAVE2 ( Fig . 5 , A \u2013 C ) , indicating that IRSp53 \u2013 WAVE2 association is very weak or transient . As reported previously , Abi1 was essen - tial for WAVE2 complex formation because RNAi of Abi1 increased the amount of monomeric WAVE2 compared with that of the WAVE2 complex ( Fig . 5 D ) . In contrast , RNAi of IRSp53 did not signifi cantly affect WAVE2 complex assembly ( Fig . 5 E and Fig . S1 C ) . We next examined the stability of the WAVE2 complex by sequential sucrose gradient . The high molecular weight fraction of the FLAG - WAVE2 preparation obtained from a sucrose gra - dient was further subjected to another sucrose gradient ( Fig . 5 E ) , showing that the WAVE2 complex was stable without any dissociation of the components in the second sucrose gradient . We then examined the dependence of protein complex forma - tion on WAVE2 localization or EGF stimulation . The amount of WAVE2 in the smaller molecular weight fraction was not increased upon stimulation ( Fig . 5 , F \u2013 I ; and Fig . S3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . A small population of IRSp53 was found in the WAVE2 complex fraction and monomeric WAVE2 fraction , but it appeared to dissociate during fractionation ( Fig . 5 , F and H ) . Differences in the localization of WAVE2 ( cytosolic or Triton X - 100 ) did not result in differences in the amounts of the two populations of WAVE2 ( Fig . 5 , F \u2013 I ; and Fig . S3 ) . We added GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Rac alone ( Fig . 5 J and Fig . S3 ) or a combination of GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Rac , IRSp53 , and PIP 3 - containing liposomes ( Fig . 5 K and Fig . S3 ) to cell - purifi ed WAVE2 . However , no signifi cant increase in WAVE2 in the smaller molecular weight fraction was observed . To examine the dependence of activities on WAVE2 com - plex formation , we analyzed the activity of each sucrose gradi - ent fraction from Triton X - 100 fractions of serum - starved cells in Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization assays . As a control , actin polymerization was induced in sucrose gradients prepared in the absence of protein . Increased sucrose concentration de - creased the rate of actin polymerization , but the maximum actin polymerization achieved was not altered ( Fig . 5 L ) . When the rate of actin polymerization of each fraction was normalized to that induced by Arp2 / 3 alone , WAVE2 protein concentration , as determined by Western blotting , was associated with Arp2 / 3 activation ( Fig . 5 , M and N ) . Therefore , actin polymerization between monomeric WAVE2 and the WAVE2 complex did not differ signifi cantly . High activity of WAVE2 complex from the membrane fraction independent of protein complex formation Because we did not detect signifi cant differences in Arp2 / 3 acti - vation between the two WAVE2 populations , we examined the activity of the entire WAVE2 elution . We did not detect any sig - nifi cant alterations in actin polymerization in WAVE2 protein complexes alone ( unpublished data ) . When we added purifi ed Arp2 / 3 , WAVE2 complex from various preparations showed Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . WAVE2 complex from the Triton X - 100 fraction showed greater Arp2 / 3 complex activation than that from the cytosol fraction ( Fig . 6 A ) . To assess differences in activity more quantitatively , we determined concentration - dependent activation curves for WAVE2 com - plexes from various preparations ( Fig . 6 B ) . From these curves , we confi rmed that WAVE2 complex from the Triton X - 100 frac - tion had greater activity than that from the cytosol fraction . WAVE2 complex activity from the Triton X - 100 fraction was similar to that of the VCA domain of WAVE2 ( Fig . 6 B ) . EGF stimulation did not alter WAVE2 activity . Thus , cytosolic WAVE2 was not fully activated but membrane WAVE2 was . Because WAVE2 from the Triton X - 100 fraction was fully active and WAVE2 in the protein complex had similar activity to that of WAVE2 not in the complex ( Fig . 5 H ) , WAVE2 in the protein complex may be fully activated . We also measured the activity of the WAVE2 complex in MEFs . Almost all of the WAVE2 was complexed ( Fig . 5 C ) . The activity of the WAVE2 complex prepared from the Triton X - 100 fraction was also higher than that of the cytosolic WAVE2 com - plex , and no signifi cant difference in the activities was induced by EGF stimulation ( Fig . 6 C ) . IRSp53 - dependent activation of the WAVE2 complex To determine the absence or presence of IRSp53 , we performed RNAi experiments to decrease IRSp53 expression . WAVE2 complex purifi ed from the Triton X - 100 fraction of cells with decreased IRSp53 expression by vector - based RNAi or by siRNA showed decreased Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Fig . 6 , D and E ; and not depicted ) . Restoration of IRSp53 in IRSp53 RNAi cells restored WAVE2 activity ( unpublished data ) . The activity of the cytosolic WAVE2 complex was not altered ( unpublished data ) , and the WAVE2 complex showed no detect - able changes in silver - stained gels and in Western blot analysis in response to RNAi of IRSp53 ( Fig . S1 C ) . We next examined whether exogenous IRSp53 activates the cytosolic WAVE2 complex . The addition of a 10 - fold molar excess of purifi ed IRSp53 to the cytosolic WAVE2 complex activated the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 6 F ) , strongly indicating that IRSp53 activates WAVE2 at the membrane . Rac - , IRSp53 - , and PIP 3 - dependent activation of WAVE2 independent of protein complex formation To confi rm the activation of WAVE2 by IRSp53 , we prepared recombinant proteins ( Fig . S4 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . We examined whether IRSp53 was able to activate recombinant WAVE2 alone or the reconstituted WAVE2 complex ( Fig . S4 ) . We also examined the effects of PIP 3 - containing liposomes or control liposome composed of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and PI and that of lipi - dated Rac . Recombinant WAVE2 alone was activated by IRSp53 in the presence of GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Rac and PIP 3 - containing PC / PI liposomes ( Fig . 7 , A and C ) .

We also examined the activation of the reconstituted WAVE2 complex . Abi1 , Nap1 , and PIR121 did not show the ac - tivation of WAVE2 ( Fig . 7 B ) . Lack of PIP 3 , Rac , and / or IRSp53 decreased the activation of WAVE2 . Cdc42 failed to activate the reconstituted WAVE2 complex in the presence of IRSp53 and PIP 3 - containing liposomes ( unpublished data ) . PIP 3 - containing liposomes alone were not suffi cient for activation of the WAVE2 complex . Rac did not activate the reconstituted WAVE2 in the presence of liposomes ( Fig . 7 B ) . To confi rm the PIP 3 - and Rac - dependent activation of WAVE2 by IRSp53 , various concentrations of IRSp53 were ex - amined ( Fig . 7 C ) . In the presence of PC / PI , IRSp53 did not acti - vate WAVE2 . However , in the presence of Rac and PIP 3 / PC / PI , IRSp53 activated WAVE2 in a concentration - dependent manner . Thus , Rac requires IRSp53 to activate WAVE2 in the presence of liposomes . The A5 mutant of WAVE2 , which is defective in PIP 3 binding ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) , failed to be activated by IRSp53 in the presence of Rac and PIP 3 - containing liposome ( Fig . 7 D ) . Interestingly , IRSp53 alone activated WAVE2 in the ab - sence of liposomes or the PIP 3 - binding ability of WAVE2 ( Fig . 7 , C \u2013 E ) . Indeed , the activation of WAVE2 by IRSp53 was much stronger in the absence of liposomes ( Fig . 7 C ) . Thus , liposomes may titrate out IRSp53 from WAVE2 by a nonspecifi c IRSp53 \u2013 lipid association . PIP 3 and Rac may then aid the association between IRSp53 and WAVE2 in the presence of liposomes . In the absence of liposomes , Abi1 , Nap1 , and PIR121 showed no signifi cant WAVE2 activation ( Fig . 7 F ) . The addi - tion of Rac to WAVE2 alone or the reconstituted WAVE2 com - plex did not affect actin polymerization in the absence of liposomes ( Fig . 7 F and not depicted ) . IRSp53 binds to lipid via the RCB domain PIP 3 - dependent activation of WAVE2 by Rac and IRSp53 indi - cates that IRSp53 also binds to lipids . The crystal structure of the NH 2 - terminal domain of IRSp53 , termed the IMD or RCB domain , has been reported previously ( Millard et al . , 2005 ) . The overall surface of the IMD is positively charged , suggest - ing that the IMD binds to the electronegative inner leafl et of the cell membrane . We determined the binding of the RCB domain , the shorter fragment of the IMD , to lipids by ELISA ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) , in which various lipids were coated onto plates . The RCB domain bound to almost all of the lipid species , with increased binding corresponding to increased negative charges ( Fig . 8 B ) . The RCB domain bound strongly to phosphatidyl - serine or weakly to PI , which are abundant lipids of the cell membrane ( Fig . 8 B ) . The affi nity of the RCB domains to vari - ous lipids indicated the nonselective binding of the RCB domain to the membrane . In the liposome cosedimentation assay , where bound proteins to the liposome were examined , no difference in affi nity was observed between PIP 3 - containing liposomes and PIP 3 - lacking liposomes ( Fig . 8 C and not depicted ) . Without liposome , only a trace amount of RCB protein was found in the precipitates ( Fig . 8 D ) . Therefore , although RCB domain bound to negatively charged lipids , there was no selective binding of the RCB domain to PIP 3 or other phosphoinositides . IRSp53 ap - pears to bind to the cell membrane via electrostatic interactions between the RCB domain and membrane . Rac - and PIP 3 - dependent association between WAVE2 and IRSp53 in the presence of liposomes We next examined the association of Rac , IRSp53 , and WAVE2 with PIP 3 - containing liposomes . Recombinant IRSp53 bound to PIP 3 / PC / PI liposomes ( Fig . 9 , A \u2013 C ) but also bound to PC / PI liposomes at this concentration . Rac purifi ed from Sf9 cells also associated with liposomes , presumably through lipid modifi ca - tion ( Fig . 8 , A and B ; Hall , 1998 ) . WAVE2 alone also bound to PIP 3 ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) , but in the presence of both activated ( GTP \u03b3 S loaded ) Rac and IRSp53 , the association of WAVE2 with PIP 3 - containing liposomes increased fi vefold ( Fig . 9 , A and C ) . Importantly , the increase in WAVE2 association in the presence of liposomes was not observed with GTP \u03b3 S - loaded Cdc42 , GDP - loaded Rac , or liposomes lacking PIP 3 ( Fig . 9 , A \u2013 C ) .

Thus , PIP 3 and Rac appear to greatly enhance the as - sociation between IRSp53 and WAVE2 or the WAVE2 complex on liposomes or cell membrane . The actin polymerization assay on PIP 3 - or PI - coated beads confi rmed the PIP 3 - dependent as - sociation and activation of WAVE2 ( Fig . S5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200509067 / DC1 ) . Discussion In this study , we showed that IRSp53 is involved for the activa - tion of WAVE2 in the membrane fraction of cells . IRSp53 was signifi cantly concentrated in the membrane fraction , whereas WAVE2 , Abi1 , Nap1 , and Sra1 were not . We also showed that both the WAVE2 complex from cells and the reconstituted WAVE2 complex could be fully active . IRSp53 enhanced the activation of WAVE2 in the absence of liposomes . However , Rac possesses a lipid modifi cation and exists at the membrane , and IRSp53 induced the Rac - dependent activation of WAVE2 or WAVE2 complex only in the presence of PIP 3 - containing liposomes . Therefore , PIP 3 at the membrane is essential for the Rac - dependent association of IRSp53 and WAVE2 . In the pres - ence of liposomes lacking PIP 3 , the weak binding of WAVE2 to liposomes inhibited its activation by IRSp53 . Cdc42 , another small GTPase that binds to IRSp53 , weakened the association between IRSp53 and WAVE2 . Regulation of WAVE2 and actin cytoskeletal reorganization Our experiments did not detect differences in WAVE2 activity in Arp2 / 3 activation between no stimulation , EGF stimulation Figure 9 . Rac - and PIP 3 - dependent actin polymerization mediated by IRSp53 and WAVE2 on PIP 3 . ( A and B ) Protein \u2013 lipid association was monitored by cosedimenta - tion assay . Cosedimented proteins with liposomes with or without PIP 3 were examined by Western blot analysis .

The activity of WAVE2 from MEFs was not signifi cantly increased upon stimulation ( Fig . 6 C ) , suggesting that overall WAVE2 activity remains constant be - fore and after stimulation . When we consider the relationship between membrane localization and activation of WAVE2 , EGF stimulation or expression of Rac CA induced only a 15 \u2013 20 % increase in membrane - bound WAVE2 in both A431 cells and MEFs ( Fig . 3 and not depicted ) , and membrane - localized WAVE2 comprised (cid:6) 60 % of WAVE2 in Triton X - 100 preparations ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , only an (cid:6) 10 % increase in membrane WAVE2 in the Triton X - 100 fraction appears to occur upon EGF stimulation . If EGF stimulation activates WAVE2 by inducing the membrane trans - location of WAVE2 , it may be too small to be detected in actin polymerization assays with WAVE2 prepared from whole cells . Possible regulation of WAVE2 by localization via formation of the WAVE2 complex and enhancement of its activity by IRSp53 We did not detect differences in WAVE2 activity from cells , as discussed in the previous section , but we were able to reconsti - tute Rac - dependent WAVE2 activation and found that IRSp53 associated with the membrane . IRSp53 possesses an NH 2 - terminal RCB domain that is also called the IMD . Electrostatic interaction may account for the nonspecifi c binding of IRSp53 to the membrane ( Fig . 8 ) . Rac is also lipidated , and activated Rac is thought to function at the membrane . Therefore , PIP 3 pro - duction may simultaneously activate Rac and recruit WAVE2 . Because IRSp53 bound to the membrane without specifi c bind - ing to phosphoinositides , IRSp53 is thought to constitutively bind to the membrane . Activated Rac may recruit IRSp53 to sites of PIP 3 production , where WAVE2 is also recruited . Thus , PIP 3 production may increase the possibility of IRSp53 \u2013 WAVE2 association at the membrane , resulting in membrane protrusion . Kinetic analysis and sucrose gradient fractionation re - vealed that the association of IRSp53 and WAVE2 is very transient . IRSp53 was copurifi ed with WAVE2 , but during sucrose gradi - ent fractionation , the majority of IRSp53 appeared to dissociate ( Fig . 5 ) . This transient association between IRSp53 and WAVE2 may be involved in the signal - dependent activation of WAVE2 . Recently , Tiam1 , a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor , was reported to enhance the association between IRSp53 and WAVE2 ( Connolly et al . , 2005 ) . Although we failed to detect Tiam1 in the WAVE2 complex by Western blotting , pre - sumably because of indirect association ( unpublished data ) , proteins such as Tiam1 may participate in the effi cient activa - tion of WAVE2 . In contrast to the association of IRSp53 with WAVE2 , the WAVE2 complex was very stable , at least in vitro . As reported earlier , Sra1 / PIR121 , Nap1 , and Abi1 binds to Rac , Nck , and Abl , respectively ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Echarri et al . , 2004 ; Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . We did not observe the dissociation of the WAVE2 complex upon the addition of Rac or Nck or upon simultaneous addition of IRSp53 , PIP 3 , and Rac ( Fig . 5 and not depicted ) . Phosphorylation of WAVE2 by Abl has also been reported to play a role in WAVE2 activation ( Leng et al . , 2005 ) . However , we did not detect any difference in WAVE2 activity upon EGF stimulation in the presence or ab - sence of STI - 571 , an Abl inhibitor ( unpublished data ) . It has also been reported that Abl is involved in Rac activation and that ruffl e formation downstream of Rac is independent of Abl fam - ily kinase activity ( Sini et al . , 2004 ) . However , Abl - mediated phosphorylation of WAVE2 may be involved in other cells . In our experiments , the knockdown of IRSp53 did not induce defects in lamellipodium formation as severe as those induced by the knockdown of Abi1 ( Figs . 1 and 2 , and Video 1 ) . WAVE2 is essential for the invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella , and increased IRSp53 binding to WAVE2 was reported upon Salmonella infection ( Shi et al . , 2005 ) . However , IRSp53 was not essential for the invasion itself . These results indicate that WAVE2 is regulated mainly by its localization via formation of the WAVE2 complex ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , IRSp53 may optimize WAVE2 activity by enhancing its activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . In a previous study of the WAVE1 protein complex in the brain , dissociation of WAVE1 from the partial protein complex of Abi , Nap1 , and Sra1 / PIR121 was observed upon incubation with Rac or Nck , and the WAVE1 complex alone was sub - stantially inactive , suggesting the activation of WAVE1 upon dissociation from the complex ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . We have also observed that cytosolic WAVE2 had less activity than mem - brane - bound WAVE2 from A431 cells and MEFs . Also , we found that the WAVE2 complex , both reconstituted and purifi ed from cells , can be fully active without dissociation of the complex . The reason for this discrepancy is not known , but it may be caused by different WAVE complex purifi cation proto - cols ; Eden et al . , ( 2002 ) used ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytosolic fraction of the brain to purify WAVE1 , whereas we immunoprecipitated WAVE2 directly from cell lysates . Protocol differences may result in the loss of unidentifi ed complex com - ponents that activate WAVE2 in our preparations . Alternatively , differences between WAVE1 and WAVE2 may be involved . Materials and methods Cells and puri\ufb01 cation of the WAVE2 complex A431 cells were transfected with FLAG - tagged WAVE2 in pCMV - Tag 2 ( Stratagene ) or with vector alone . FLAG - tagged WAVE2 is functional be - cause the transfection of FLAG - tagged WAVE2 into WAVE2 knockout cells eliminated WAVE2 de\ufb01 cits . After selection with G418 , cells with stable FLAG - WAVE2 expression were grown . These cells did not show any sig - ni\ufb01 cant change in growth or appearance compared with vector - transfected cells or parental cells . The amount of FLAG - WAVE2 expression was similar to the amount of endogenous WAVE2 . 10 6 cells were plated onto 15 - cm dishes and cultured for 5 d . After serum starvation overnight , some cul - tures were stimulated with EGF . To purify the WAVE2 complex from the cytosol ( cytosol fraction ) , cells were harvested in buffer A containing 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM NaF , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM PMSF , 10 \u03bc g / ml aprotinin , and 10 \u03bc g / ml leupeptin . To purify the WAVE2 complex , including that from the membrane fraction ( Triton fraction ) , cells were harvested in buffer A supplemented with 1 % Triton X - 100 and 10 % glycerol . Cells were sonicated and clari\ufb01 ed by cen - trifugation at 20 , 000 g for 20 min . The resulting supernatant was mixed with FLAG - agarose af\ufb01 nity gel ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After being mixed for 1 h , gels were washed with buffer A supplemented with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and 10 % glycerol and were washed with buffer XB containing 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 9 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 5 mM EGTA .

The eluted protein was analyzed or processed with sucrose gradient fractionation . 3 \u2013 30 % sucrose gradient was prepared in buffer XB supplemented with 10 % glycerol , and the gradient was centri - fuged at 200 , 000 g for 15 h . After sucrose gradient , the WAVE2 complex at high molecular weight fraction ( typically fraction No . 8 \u2013 10 ) was used for further experiments after concentration by the Ultrafree \ufb01 lter ( Millipore ) . Transfection and RNAi experiments Cells were transfected with FuGene 6 ( Roche ) . 10 6 cells in 15 - cm dishes were cultured for 24 h , and these cells were transfected for 24 h and cul - tured for 24 h . Cells were then starved overnight and used for assays . RNAi was performed as described previously with pSuper vector ( Kurisu et al . , 2005 ) or stealth RNAi ( Invitrogen ) . The sequence of IRSp53 RNAi was G G A G C T G C A G T A C A T C G A C . Abi1 RNAi was performed as de - scribed previously ( Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . Control RNAi was performed with pSuper vector with a sequence that caused no reduction of protein expression . Transfection ef\ufb01 ciency was (cid:6) 80 % when monitored by transfection with GFP - expressing plasmid . For cotransfection with WAVE2 - GFP ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) , WAVE2 - GFP and RNAi vector plasmids were mixed at 1 : 4 ratios to ensure the cotransfection of GFP - positive cells . Rac G12V and Cdc42 G12V were used as CA Rac and Cdc42 , respectively , and were expressed in the pEF - BOS vector ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . IRSp53 was tagged with Venus , a brighter variant of GFP ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) . siRNA was performed with stealth RNAi ( Invitrogen ) . The siRNA sequence targeting was as follows : IRSp53 # 1 , 5 \u2032 - A G U A C U C G G A C A A - G G A G C U G C A G U A - 3 \u2032 ; IRSp53 # 2 , 5 \u2032 - A C U C G G A C A A G G A G C U G C A G U - A C A U - 3 \u2032 ; IRTKS # 1 , 5 \u2032 - C A A U C C U G G G C U G C G A A A U U U A A U A - 3 \u2032 ; IRTKS # 2 , 5 \u2032 - C G U G A A A U A U A U G A A C G C A A C U C U A - 3 \u2032 ; IRTKS # 3 , 5 \u2032 - C G U G A - A A U A U A U G A A C G C A A C U C U A - 3 \u2032 ; IRTKS # 4 , 5 \u2032 - C A A G G A A G C C G A A A - C G C A C U C A A A U - 3 \u2032 ; control # 1 , 5 \u2032 - A G U G G C U A A C A G A G G C G U C A C A G U A - 3 \u2032 ; control # 2 , 5 \u2032 - A C U A G A C G A A G C G G U A C U G A G C C A U - 3 \u2032 ; control # 3 , 5 \u2032 - C A A G U C C G G C G U A A G U U A A U U C A U A - 3 \u2032 ; control # 4 , 5 \u2032 - C A A G A A G - C C A A A C G C U C A A C G G A A U - 3 \u2032 ; Abi1 # 1 , HSS115189 ( Invitrogen ) ; Abi1 # 2 , HSS115190 ( Invitrogen ) ; and Abi1 # 3 , HSS115191 ( Invitrogen ) . A431 cells were transfected with 2 . 6 \u03bc l of 20 \u03bc M siRNA in 120 \u03bc l OPTI - MEM and 1 . 2 \u03bc l LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) in 120 \u03bc l OPTI - MEM in a six - well plate with 1 ml DME + 10 % FCS . After 24 h , a second trans - fection was performed , and the cells were cultured for 48 h and subjected to RT - PCR or various experiments . The mRNA from RNAi - treated A431 cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . A \ufb01 rst - strand cDNA was syn - thesized from the mRNA by the SuperScript First - strand synthesis system for RT - PCR ( Invitrogen ) . The PCR ampli\ufb01 cation was performed using the \ufb01 rst - strand cDNA . Ampli\ufb01 cation conditions were as follows : 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0 C , 30 s at 60 \u00b0 C , 60 s at 72 \u00b0 C , and a \ufb01 nal extension of 10 min at 72 \u00b0 C . IRSp53 expression construct that was resistant for RNAi was prepared by g486a and c495a mutations . Antibodies Anti - IRSp53 and anti - Abi1 antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with full - length IRSp53 and Abi1 proteins puri\ufb01 ed from Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins . Anti - WAVE2 was raised as described previously ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) . Anti - GFP antibody was purchased from MBL Inter - national Corporation , and anti - FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Cell staining was performed as described previously , and actin \ufb01 laments were stained with phalloidin ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were then observed by confocal microscopy ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Anti - IRTKS antibody ( M051 - 3 ) was purchased from MBL International Corpora - tion and was found to be anti - IRSp53 antibody ( Fig . S1 B ) . Cell fractionation Cells were harvested in buffer A and sonicated . Lysates were clari\ufb01 ed by centrifugation at 3 , 000 g for 30 min to remove nuclei and debris . Supernatants were then clari\ufb01 ed by ultracentrifugation at 400 , 000 g for 45 min . The resulting supernatant was the cytosol fraction , and the pellet was the membrane fraction . Both were mixed with SDS - PAGE sample buffer to the same \ufb01 nal volume , and the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting . Recombinant proteins All recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells with the Bac - to - Bac Baculovirus Expression System ( Invitrogen ) . WAVE2 and Abi1 were tagged with GST at their COOH termini and expressed with pFastBac . PIR121 was tagged with GST at its COOH terminus and was coexpressed with Nap1 in the pFastBac Dual vector . WAVE2 tagged with GST and Abi1 were also coexpressed in the pFastBac Dual vector for better expression . Approximately half of WAVE2 that coexpressed with Abi1 was complexed with Abi1 after puri\ufb01 cation . Proteins were puri\ufb01 ed as described previously ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . Determination of Kd value using a dual polarization interferometer The interaction of WAVE2 with the coiled - coil region of Abi1 or the SH3 domain of IRSp53 using a dual polarization interferometer was investi - gated with AnaLight Bio 200 ( Far\ufb01 eld ) as described previously ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . WAVE2 was cross - linked on sensortip coated with amine with BS3 cross - linker ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The Kd values were calculated from curve \ufb01 tting . Actin polymerization assay Actin polymerization assays were performed in XB buffer as described previously ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was used at a concen - tration of 50 nM . Liposome cosedimentation assay and actin polymerization assay on PIP 3 - coated beads PIP 3 , PC , and PI as well as PIP 3 - coated beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences . Liposome cosedimentation assays were performed as de - scribed previously ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . For actin \ufb01 lament formation as - says on PIP 3 beads , 40 \u03bc g / ml WAVE2 - GST coexpressed with Abi1 , 100 \u03bc g / ml GST - IRSp53 , and 30 \u03bc g / ml GTP \u03b3 S - or GDP - loaded GST - Rac in 10 \u03bc l XB buffer were incubated with 2 \u03bc l PIP 3 - coated beads . WAVE2 complex from A431 cells ( 0 . 5 \u03bc g / ml WAVE2 ) was also incubated with PIP 3 - coated beads and Rac . After incubation at room temperature for 20 min , beads were washed with 100 \u03bc l XB buffer . Beads were then mixed with 50 \u03bc l XB buffer containing 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 2 \u03bc M G - actin , 2 mg / ml BSA , and 2 unit / ml rhodamine - labeled phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) on ice . After incubation for 20 min on ice , 10 \u03bc l of bead - containing solu - tion was placed between 18 \u00d7 18 - mm BSA - coated glass and slide glass . After 10 min at room temperature , actin \ufb01 laments were observed by phal - loidin \ufb02 uorescence . Fluorescence intensity was calculated by ImageJ soft - ware with the Oval pro\ufb01 le plug - in ( National Institutes of Health ) . Image acquisition and processing All \ufb02 uorescent images were taken through a microscope ( Eclipse E600 ; Nikon ) with a confocal microscopy system ( Radiance 2000 ; Bio - Rad Labo - ratories ) at room temperature . Fluorochromes used include AlexaFluor488 , 546 , and 647 and rhodamine ( all purchased from Invitrogen ) . A 60 \u00d7 NA 1 . 40 oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) was used . Images were assembled with Adobe Photoshop . In each plate , photographs were cropped , and each \ufb02 uorochrome was adjusted identically for brightness and contrast to represent the observed images . Time - lapse images were taken through a phase - contrast microscope ( Axiovert S100 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) with a camera ( CCD - 782 - Y / HS ; Princeton Instruments ) . A 40 \u00d7 NA 1 . 30 FLUAR oil immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) was used . Western blotting and densitometry The samples were electrophoresed in SDS - PAGE gels , transferred to polyvi - nylidene di\ufb02 uoride membrane , blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in PBS and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , incubated with primary antibodies , and incubated with alkaline - phosphatase \u2013 conjugated goat IgG secondary antibodies ( Promega ) followed by incubation with NBT / BCIP substrate ( Roche ) . Result - ing blots were scanned with a calibrated densitometer ( GS - 710 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) and quanti\ufb01 ed with ImageJ software . Online supplemental material Fig .

For instance , acto - myosin - dependent contraction forces exerted at focal adhesions ( FAs ) allow the cell to actively probe substrate elasticity . Here , we report that a subset of long - lived and \ufb02 at clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) , also termed plaques , are contractility - independent mechanosensitive signaling platforms . We observed that plaques assemble in response to increasing substrate rigidity and that this is independent of FAs , actin and myosin - II activity . We show that plaque assembly depends on \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 integrin , and is a consequence of frustrated endocytosis whereby \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 tightly engaged with the stiff substrate locally stalls CCS dynamics . We also report that plaques serve as platforms for receptor - dependent signaling and are required for increased Erk activation and cell proliferation on stiff environments . We conclude that CCSs are mechanotransduction structures that sense substrate rigidity independently of cell contractility .

Besides chemical signals sensed by speci \ufb01 c receptors , cells also respond to mechanical stimuli with important consequences for cell migration , proliferation and differentiation 1 \u2013 3 . It is gen - erally accepted that cells probe mechanical features of the micro - environment by applying forces on it 4 \u2013 6 . Contractile forces gen - erated by the acto - myosin network and transmitted to the sub - strate at integrin - rich cell adhesions endow these adhesions to grow and mature into focal adhesions ( FAs ) , in a matrix rigidity - dependent manner 7 , 8 . In turn , FAs maturation has profound consequences for the cell as it modulates signaling pathways regulating migration , survival and proliferation . Clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) are mostly described to control the uptake of cell - surface receptors , including some integrins . However , it is now clear that in some conditions , CCSs can also serve as integrin - dependent adhesion structures 9 . Many cell types , including HeLa cells , display two distinct types of CCSs : cano - nical , dynamic clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and long - lived , large and \ufb02 at clathrin lattices also called plaques . Although plaques have been widely described and shown to be enriched in signaling receptors and integrins 10 \u2013 12 , it is still not clear how they form and what is their function . CCSs have mostly been studied in cells growing on glass which is an extremely stiff substrate . A whole range of tissue rigidity is encountered in vivo with some tissues being very soft ( Young \u2019 s modulus , E \u2248 0 . 1 kPa ) like the brain or fat tissues , while some other are stiffer like muscles ( \u2248 30 kPa ) 13 . Here , we set out to investigate CCSs dynamics on substrates of controlled elasticity . We report that clathrin - coated plaques assemble as a consequence of increasing substrate rigidity . Sur - prisingly , plaque formation on stiff environments is independent of cell contractility but is the consequence of a frustrated endo - cytosis process whereby \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - integrin prevents CCSs budding by anchoring the structure to the substrate . We further report that receptor clustering at clathrin - coated plaques potentiates intracellular signaling and increases cell proliferation . In sum - mary , we propose that clathrin - coated plaques are mechan - osensitive structures instructing the cell about the rigidity of its environment . Results Clathrin - coated plaques are sensitive to substrate rigidity . When HeLa cells were grown on collagen - coated glass , ventral plasma membrane CCSs marked with the \u03b1 - adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 appeared as a mix of dot - like , diffraction - limited structures corresponding to CCPs , and large , heterogeneous structures corresponding to plaques , as previously reported 11 , 12 , 14 ( Fig . 1a ) . Strikingly , cells seeded on soft ( 0 . 1 kPa ) collagen - coated polyacrylamide gels only showed dot - like CCSs suggesting that plaques cannot form in these conditions ( Fig . 1a ) . Similar results were obtained with cells cultured on 5 kPa gels ( Fig . 1a ) . However , cells seeded on 31 kPa gels showed a mix of diffraction - limited CCPs and larger structures potentially corre - sponding to plaques ( Fig . 1a ) . Super - resolution STED microscopy analyses further con \ufb01 rmed the presence of many large CCSs in cells grown on glass or on 31 kPa gels while only dot - like structures were detected on 0 . 1 and 5 kPa gels ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Scanning electron microscopy analyses of unroofed cells con \ufb01 rmed the presence of large , \ufb02 at clathrin - coated plaques at the adherent plasma membrane of cells cultured on glass or on 31 kPa gels ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Importantly , such large and \ufb02 at clathrin lattices were mostly absent in cells seeded on 0 . 1 or 5 kPa gels ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . We next performed live cell ima - ging of genome - edited HeLa cells engineered to express GFP - tagged , endogenous \u03bc 2 - adaptin subunit of AP - 2 . Many CCSs were large and long - lived when cells were grown on glass , re \ufb02 ecting the mostly static nature of clathrin - coated plaques ( Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Fig . 2a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Similar results were obtained when cells were seeded on 31 kPa gels ( Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Fig . 2a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . However , the proportion of long - lived CCSs dramati - cally dropped in HeLa cells cultured on softer gels ( 0 . 1 and 5 kPa ; Fig . 1b , c , Supplementary Fig . 2a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Similar to HeLa cells , HepG2 and Caco - 2 cell lines harbored both dynamic CCPs and large , static CCSs when cultured on glass or on 31 kPa gels while only short - lived CCPs were detectable on softer gels ( Supplementary Fig . 2b \u2013 e ) . However , we did not measure any elasticity - dependent modulation of CCSs dynamics in MDA - MB - 231 cell line that was previously reported to only harbor CCPs 15 ( Supplementary Fig . 2f , g ) . Together , our results demonstrate that clathrin - coated plaques are mechanosensitive structures that some cell types assemble in response to stiff substrates . Substrate rigidity sensing is described as an active process involving actin - dependent contraction forces transmitted to the ECM at FAs 4 \u2013 6 . Thus , we tested whether acto - myosin - generated forces and FAs are required for plaques formation . Inhibiting myosin - II activity or actin polymerization with blebbistatin or cytochalasin D respectively , did not prevent the formation of large and static CCSs in HeLa cells grown on glass ( Fig . 1d , e ) and large , \ufb02 at clathrin lattices were still detected by scanning electron microscopy in cells treated with blebbistatin ( Fig . 1f ) . In addition , interfering with FAs assembly using Talin1 - speci \ufb01 c siRNAs did not prevent but rather increased the formation of long - lived , large CCSs ( Supplementary Fig . 2h \u2013 j ) . These results demonstrate that plaque formation does not rely on cell contractility and suggest that plaques represent a new type of mechanosensitive structures . Integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 is required for plaque assembly . In the classical mechanosensation model , cell - generated forces are transmitted through integrins binding the ECM at FAs . Although they assemble in a contractility - independent manner , plaques have been proposed to adhere to the substratum 16 , 17 . Integrin \u03b2 5 was reported to be highly enriched at plaques 10 , 18 . \u03b2 5 interacts with \u03b1 v - integrin to form the high - af \ufb01 nity vitronectin receptor 19 , 20 . We observed that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 strongly colocalized with CCSs at the ventral plasma membrane of HeLa cells cultured on glass ( Fig . 2a ) . Close inspection revealed that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 was highly enriched in plaques as compared to CCPs ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The degree of association between \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and AP - 2 - marked CCSs signi \ufb01 cantly decreased on softer gels ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . We next tested whether \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 was required for plaque formation on hard surfaces . Knockdown of either \u03b1 v or \u03b2 5 integrins using speci \ufb01 c siRNAs resulted in a complete loss of large and static CCSs ( Fig . 2d \u2013 f , Supplementary Fig . 4a \u2013 d and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . We did not observed any effect of \u03b2 1 or \u03b2 3 integrins depletion on CCS dynamics ( Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) . Inhibiting \u03b2 5 in HepG2 cells also precluded the formation of large CCSs ( Supplementary Fig . 4g ) . In addition , plaque formation was rescued by expressing a siRNA - resistant \u03b2 5 - encoding construct in \u03b2 5 - depleted HeLa cells ( Fig . 2g ) . Of note , MDA - MB - 231 cells that mostly harbor dynamic CCSs ( Supplementary Fig . 2e , f ) displayed drastically lower levels of \u03b1 v and \u03b2 5 integrins as compared to HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . Overexpression of \u03b1 v and \u03b2 5 integrins in these cells resulted in a ~ 4 - fold increase in long - lived CCSs ( Supplementary Fig . 4i ) . Together , our results demon - strate that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - integrin is required for plaque formation on rigid environments . Integrins are generally recruited at CCSs through binding to speci \ufb01 c adaptors of the Phosphotyrosine Binding ( PTB ) ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 3825 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications domain - containing protein family . For instance , \u03b2 5 - integrin has been shown to interact with the clathrin adaptors Numb and Dab2 21 . Both Numb and Dab2 are present at plaques ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5a ) and inhibiting their expression using speci \ufb01 c siRNAs led to a strong reduction of the size of CCSs as well as a moderate reduction of the proportion of long - lived structures ( Supplementary Fig . 5b \u2013 e ) . In these experiments , we noticed a strong delocalization of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 to peripheral structures that were positive for the FA marker phospho - Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) .

This suggested that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 may shuttle to FAs in the absence of clathrin - coated plaques . \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 is only poorly associated with FAs in control cells and , accordingly , \u03b2 5 - depletion did not modulate FAs number and size , nor the activation status of FAK ( Supplementary Fig . 6a \u2013 e ) . However , preventing CCSs formation with AP - 2 siRNAs resulted in larger FAs and this was dependent on \u03b2 5 - integrin expression ( Supple - mentary Fig . 6f , g ) . Thus , in the absence of CCSs , \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 shuttling to FAs induces an overgrowth of these adhesion structures . Together , our data suggest that Dab2 / Numb - dependent recruit - ment of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 at CCSs results in the formation of clathrin - coated plaques and that in the absence of plaques , \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 is targeted to and modulates the dynamics of FAs . Plaque formation is a consequence of frustrated endocytosis . We reasoned that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 engagement with the ECM may prevent CCSs budding , leading to the formation of plaques .

We observed an increased density of large and stable CCSs when the glass was \ufb01 rst coated with vitronectin before allowing HeLa cells to adhere in the presence of complete medium ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . However , vitronectin coating did not result in more static CCSs on the soft environment ( Supplementary Fig . 7c , d ) . In addition , most large and long - lived CCSs were detected at cell / ECM con - tact areas rather than at non - adherent regions of the ventral plasma membrane when cells were cultured on ring - shaped , collagen - coated micropatterns ( Supplementary Fig . 7e \u2013 g ) . These data suggest that local and strong engagement of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 with the ECM may be required for plaque assembly . To test this hypothesis , cells seeded on glass were incubated in the presence of trypsin . We reasoned that trypsin - mediated \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 proteolysis may lead to the disassembly of clathrin - coated plaques . Indeed , we observed a fast dissolution of plaques upon trypsin treatment ( Fig . 3a ) . Dot - like structures seemingly emanating from dissol - ving plaques were frequently observed before they abruptly vanished ( Fig . 3a , arrows ) . These observations suggest that CCPs may bud in the vicinity of disassembling plaques , potentially participating in the dissolution of these structures . Along this line , we observed that auxillin bursts , a feature of budding CCPs 24 , were signi \ufb01 cantly more frequent at disassembling plaques as compared to plaques of untreated cells ( Fig . 3b , c and Supple - mentary Movie 3 ) . Because trypsin treatment is not speci \ufb01 c towards \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , we next monitored plaque dynamics in cells treated with Cilengitide , a drug that binds the RGD - binding cleft of this integrin and outcompetes ECM ligands 25 \u2013 27 . CCSs of HeLa cells grown on glass and treated with Cilengitide were highly dynamic as compared to untreated cells ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b and Supplementary Movie 4 ) , demonstrating that direct binding of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 to the substrate is required to maintain plaques . Moreover , we observed a fast dissolution of plaques when monitoring CCS dynamics immediately after adding Cilengitide in the medium ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary Fig . 8c and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Similar to experiments performed with trypsin , plaques seemingly disassembled into dot - like structures evoking CCPs ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , acute inhibition of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 binding to the substrate may allow the clathrin machinery to bud , leading to plaques dissolution . Accordingly , we observed that overexpressed , GFP - tagged \u03b2 5 - integrin accumulated into mCherry - tagged transferrin receptor ( TfR ) - positive vesicles after but not before treating cells with Cilengitide ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . This demonstrates that the integrin was internalized upon adding the drug , in agreement with our hypothesis . Based on a theoretical model , it has been proposed that integrin adhesion strength is reduced on soft environments because local elastic recoil upon stochastic integrin / ligand unbinding would lower chances to rebind , independently of forces 28 , 29 . Such a mechanism may explain why plaques only assemble on relatively stiff but not on more elastic substrates . We observed that the kinetics of plaque disassembly upon Cilengitide treatment were directly correlated with the stiffness of the substrate as plaques disassembled faster on softer environments ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . Because Cilengitide acts by outcompet - ing integrin ligands , these results suggest that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 adhesion strength is reduced on soft substrates . Our data suggest that plaque assembly results from a frustrated endocytosis process whereby strong receptor - mediated anchoring to the stiff substrate prevents CCSs budding . To further test this hypothesis , we made use of a construct encoding the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) carrying a mCherry tag in its extracellular domain . \u03b2 5 - integrin - depleted HeLa cells expressing or not TfR - mCherry were plated on anti - mCherry antibody - coated glass . We reasoned that immobilizing the TfR , which has a strong af \ufb01 nity for AP - 2 , may stall endocytosis and result in plaque formation . Indeed , while CCSs of \u03b2 5 - depleted cells were dot - liked and short - lived on the anti - mCherry antibodies - coated glass , cells expressing TfR - mCherry displayed many large and long - lived structures ( Fig . 3e \u2013 g and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . We further controlled that TfR - mCherry was present at CCSs in these conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Of note , TfR - mCherry - expressing cells seeded on a coverslip functionalized with an irrelevant antibody where not able to assemble plaques upon \u03b2 5 - depletion ( Fig . 3g ) . In addition , immobilizing the TfR on soft gels resulted in the accumulation of long - lived and large CCSs , although to a lesser extend as compared to the glass condition ( Supplementary Fig . 8f ) . Thus , strong receptor engagement with the substrate is suf \ufb01 cient to prevent CCSs budding and to lead to plaque formation . Overall , our results demonstrate that plaques assemble as a consequence of frustrated endocytosis . Plaques are signaling platforms for different receptors . It has been proposed that plaques are a hub for the recruitment / sorting of many signaling receptors 11 , 12 , 30 . Prolonged CCS lifetime has been associated with sustained signaling and CCSs have been envisaged as signaling platforms , independently of their role in endocytosis 31 . Thus , long - lived clathrin - coated plaques may modulate signaling pathways . In agreement with this hypothesis , we observed that the inhibition of plaque formation in \u03b2 5 - integrin - depleted cells cultured on glass resulted in a reduced steady - state signaling in the Erk pathway ( Fig . 4a , b ) . However , \u03b2 5 knockdown did not modulate Erk activity on a soft gel that do not allow plaque formation ( Fig . 4c , d ) . This suggested that plaque assembly , but not simply \u03b2 5 expression , is required to tune Erk activity . Surprisingly , AP - 2 or clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) knockdown did not modulate Erk activation status on a rigid surface ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . Because in these latter condi - tions , \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 shuttling to FAs leads to the enlargement of these structures ( Supplementary Fig . 6f , g ) and because FAs are also known to signal in the Erk pathway 32 , we aimed at testing whether FAs could mask a potential role for plaques in regulating Erk activity . We \ufb01 rst observed that AP - 2 or CHC knockdown induced a strong accumulation of phosphotyrosines at the enlarged FAs ( Supplementary Fig . 9b \u2013 d ) , in a \u03b2 5 - integrin - dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig . 6f \u2013 g ) . In agreement with our hypothesis , these results suggest that the signaling activity of FAs is increased in the absence of CCSs . In addition , while the inhibition of FA formation in Talin1 - depleted cells only slightly inhibited steady - state Erk activity , co - knockdown of Talin1 and AP - 2 or CHC strongly reduced it ( Supplementary Fig . 9e , f ) . Together , our results suggest that Erk activity is mostly controlled by CCSs in HeLa cells but that in the absence of CCSs , \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - mediated FA enlargement maintains steady - state Erk activity . To test more directly whether clathrin - coated plaques regulate Erk signaling , we took advantage of the possibility to rescue plaque formation in \u03b2 5 - depleted cells with the antibody - coating system described above . In these experimental conditions , cells are seeded on a layer of antibodies deposited onto a Poly - L - lysine coated glass . Poly - L - lysine is known to inhibit FAs maturation 33 and indeed , we could con \ufb01 rm that HeLa cells plated on such a substrate displayed fewer and smaller FAs ( Supplementary Fig . 10a \u2013 c ) . Cells expressing TfR - mCherry and Erk - GFP were treated with control or \u03b2 5 - integrin - speci \ufb01 c siRNAs and plated onto control or anti - mCherry antibody - coated glass . We observed that Erk - GFP nuclear enrichment , which re \ufb02 ects Erk activation , was similar for control cells plated on irrelevant or on anti - mCherry - coated surfaces ( Fig . 4e , f ) .

However , nuclear Erk accumulation was restored when plaque formation was allowed by plating cells on anti - mCherry anti - body - coated glass ( Fig . 4e , f ) . This results suggest that clathrin - coated plaques regulate steady - state Erk activity independently of \u03b2 5 - integrin . Accordingly , we observed that CHC and AP - 2 were required to restore Erk nuclear levels in these conditions ( Fig . 4f ) . Together , our data demonstrate that plaques serve as signaling platforms . We next aimed at investigating the mechanisms of plaque - regulated Erk activation . Con \ufb01 rming previous \ufb01 ndings 34 , 35 , we observed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) accumulates at plaques upon stimulation ( Supplementary Fig . 10d ) and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( HGFR ) behaved similarly ( Supplementary Fig . 10e ) .

Smaller structures corresponding to CCPs were also positive for the anti - phosphotyrosine staining but to a lesser extend ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Anti - phosphotyrosine staining was absent from both large and small CCSs when cells were \ufb01 rst treated with Ge \ufb01 tinib , a drug that inhibits EGFR kinase activity ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Thus , our data suggest that plaques may serve as signaling platforms in the EGFR pathway . Accordingly , EGF - induced Erk activation was reduced upon plaques ablation in \u03b2 5 - integrin - depleted cells ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Of note , cell - surface EGFR levels where not signi \ufb01 cantly modulated in these later conditions , excluding the possibility that reduced Erk activity is due to a down - modulation of the surface - exposed receptor ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . In addition , a speci \ufb01 c enrichment of phosphotyrosine staining at plaques was also observed upon stimulation with HGF ( Supplementary Fig . 11b , c ) . Collectively , these data strongly suggest that plaques serve as signaling platforms for different receptors . In addition to EGFR and HGFR , many other signaling receptors are known to be recruited at plaques 11 , 12 , and we propose that this is critical to regulate the observed steady - state Erk activity . Indeed , we observed that EGFR and HGFR are still recruited to immobilized TfR - induced plaques in the absence of \u03b2 5 - integrin and that phosphotyrosine staining still accumulate at these arti \ufb01 cial structures upon stimulation ( Fig . 5e \u2013 g ) . Thus , our model is that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 controls plaque formation on stiff environ - ments but that it is the subsequent recruitment of different signaling receptors at plaques that is the cause of Erk activity modulation .

Because their formation does not require a functional acto - myosin machinery ( Fig . 1 ) , plaques may represent a distinct , contractility - independent mechanotransduction sys - tem . Along this line , blebbistatin or cytochalasin treatments did not prevent phosphotyrosine accumulation at plaques upon EGF stimulation ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Erk activity has been reported to be mechanosensitive in a manner that is independent of acto - myosin forces 36 , 37 . Indeed , we observed that phosphorylated - Erk levels were reduced on soft as compared to hard environment ( Fig . 6c , d ) and inhibiting myosin - dependent contractility using blebbis - tatin did not modulate Erk activation status ( Fig . 6e , f ) .

However , vitronectin coating does not overcome the need for a stiff environment in order for plaques to assemble ( Supplementary Fig . 7a \u2013 d ) and thus , it did not modulate Erk activation status on 0 . 1 kPa gels ( Fig . 6c , d ) . In agreement with the role of Erk in controlling cell proliferation , we noticed that cells proliferated faster on vitronectin - as compared to collagen - coated glass ( Fig . 6g ) and inhibiting plaque formation with \u03b2 5 - speci \ufb01 c or \u03b1 v - speci \ufb01 c siRNAs reduced proliferation rate ( Fig . 6h ) . In addition , rescuing plaque formation in \u03b2 5 - integrin - depleted cells through immobilizing the TfR on the substrate resulted in an increased proliferation rate ( Fig . 6i ) . Thus , plaque assembly on rigid environments results in increased Erk activity and sustained cell proliferation . Discussion Overall , we showed that clathrin - coated plaques are mechan - osensitive signaling platforms that assemble on rigid substrates as a consequence of frustrated endocytosis . Clathrin - coated plaques have been consistently observed in diverse cell types but have overall received little attention as compared to canonical CCPs , possibly re \ufb02 ecting the lack of speci \ufb01 c markers for these structures . Yet , past investigations have pointed to a possible role of plaques in cell adhesion because of the close association of these 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 0 P - T y r / \u03b1 - adap t i n f l uo r e sc en c e i n t en s i t y r a t i o B l ebb i s t a t i n C on t r o l C y t o c ha l a s i n * \u03b1 - Adaptin P - Tyr B l ebb i s t a t i n C y t o c ha l a s i n Merge P - Erk Total - Erk G l a ss 0 . 1 k P a G l a ss 0 . 1 k P a Collagen Vitronectin 35 35 A v e r age band i n t en s i t y ( % o f v i t r one c t i n - g l a ss ) 0 . 1 k P a * * G l a ss 0 . 1 k P a G l a ss Collagen Vitronectin * P - Erk Total - Erk s i C on t r o l s i \u03b2 5 - 1 s i \u03b2 5 - 2 s i C on t r o l + B l ebb i s t a t i n 35 35 A v e r age band i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l ) s i C on t r o l s i \u03b2 5 - 1 s i \u03b2 5 - 2 * * * s i C on t r o l + B l ebb i s t a t i n Glass Vitronectin Collagen 0 1 2 C e ll nu m be r Days after seeding * * * siControl 0 1 2 Days after seeding si \u03b2 5 - 1 si \u03b2 5 - 2 si \u03b1 v - 1 si \u03b1 v - 2 * 0 1 2 0 1 . 0 . 10 5 1 . 5 . 10 5 2 . 0 . 10 5 2 . 5 . 10 5 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 6 . 10 5 5 . 10 5 4 . 10 5 3 . 10 5 2 . 10 5 1 . 10 5 0 si \u03b2 5 - 1 + TfR - mCherry / control Ab si \u03b2 5 - 1 + TfR - mCherry / anti - mCherry Ab * Days after seeding C e ll nu m be r C e ll nu m be r 6 . 10 5 5 . 10 5 4 . 10 5 3 . 10 5 2 . 10 5 1 . 10 5 0 a b c e g d f h i NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 3825 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 structures with the substrate 16 , and because they were shown to be enriched in integrins , and in particular in \u03b2 5 - integrin 10 . We report here that \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - integrin is required for plaque formation and can be considered as a marker of these structures although it can also be found at FAs in some cases . \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 engagement with the substrate prevents the clathrin machinery to bud . This is reminiscent of the \u03b2 1 - integrin - mediated frustrated endocytosis of clathrin - coated tubes found on collagen \ufb01 bers 9 . However , in this later case , frustration was only transient while plaques can be extremely long - lived . It has recently been reported that actin polymerization can participate in plaque disassembly upon LPA - receptor activation 12 . It is possible that actin polymerization provides an extra force needed for the clathrin machinery to overcome \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - mediated adhesion and to bud at plaques . Along this line , inhibiting actin polymerization resulted in a slight increase in plaque size ( Fig . 1e ) . Together , these data suggest that a force balance between endocytosis and adhesion regulates the dynamics of these structures . The equilibrium between these forces is modulated by the rigidity of the substratum so that plaques can only assemble on relatively stiff substrates . Plaques have also been proposed to have a role in signal transduction 11 , 12 although direct evidences have been missing because of the lack of tools to speci \ufb01 cally impair plaque assembly . How plaques regulate signaling is not clear yet . Others have proposed that CCSs are platforms for signaling 31 , independently of endocytosis . The capacity of CCSs to compartmentalize the plasma membrane is certainly an important , underestimated factor that will need to be investigated in the future . In that respect , large CCSs such as plaques may be more ef \ufb01 cient in transducing the signal . Because the formation of these structures does not rely on a functional acto - myosin network , we propose that plaques represent an alternative , contractility - independent rigidity sensing mechan - ism . The use of different strategies to sense the environment \u2019 s elasticity may re \ufb02 ect the importance of this mechanical parameter that has fundamental biological consequences , ranging from cell proliferation to differentiation . Because \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 - integrin and vitro - nectin levels , together with tissue rigidity , are often modulated in different physio - pathological conditions 38 \u2013 42 , CCSs - dependent mechanotransduction may have a universal role in regulating the cell response to changing environmental conditions .

Immuno \ufb02 uorescence microscopy and \ufb02 uorescence quanti \ufb01 cation . Cells were \ufb01 xed in ice - cold methanol unless stated otherwise and processed for immuno - \ufb02 uorescence microscopy by using the indicated antibodies . For anti - Phosphotyrosine staining ( P - Tyr ) , cells were brie \ufb02 y extracted for 30 s using 0 . 1 % Triton prior to \ufb01 xation . Depending on experiments imaged either through a \u00d7100 1 . 40NA UPlanSApo objective lens of a wide - \ufb01 eld IX73 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with an Orca - Flash2 . 8 CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) and steered by CellSens Dimension software ( Olympus ) , or by spinning microscopy ( see description below ) .

Total \ufb02 uorescence was measured on at least 50 cells per con - dition in three independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean \u00b1SD . For expansion microscopy 43 , cells grown on coverslips were immunostained and then treated for 10min with glutaraldehyde 0 . 25 % . The coverslips were washed and incubated in monomer solution for 1min ( 1 \u00d7PBS , 2M NaCl , 2 . 5 % ( w / w ) acrylamide , 0 . 15 % ( w / w ) N , N \u2032 - methylenebisacrylamide , 8 . 625 % ( w / w ) sodium acrylate ) . 120 \u00b5l drops of Gel solution ( 1 . 3 \u00b5l of TEMED , 1 . 3 \u00b5l of APS 10 % , 197 . 4 \u00b5l of monomer solution ) were deposited on para \ufb01 lm and the coverslips were deposited on top .

All quanti \ufb01 cations on immuno \ufb02 uorescence images were done with FIJI after background subtraction . To measure the size of CCSs on expansion microscopy images , \u03b1 - adaptin - positive structures were manually delimited and the area was measured using ImageJ . Dot - like objects with area lower or equal to 0 . 0175 \u00b5m 2 ( radius 0 . 075 \u00b5m ) were classi \ufb01 ed as clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) , whereas irregularly shaped objects with an area larger than 0 . 0175 \u00b5m 2 were classi \ufb01 ed as clathrin - coated plaques .

Fluorescence enrichment index of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 or of P - Tyr at CCPs or plaques was measured by manually delimitating \u03b1 - adaptin - positive structures in order to measure the \ufb02 uorescence intensity of \u03b1 - adaptin and of \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 or of P - Tyr staining . Values were subsequently normalized to the average \ufb02 uorescence of the \u03b1 - adaptin channel and normalized intensity values were used for the analysis . At least 100 structures ( 50 for the HGF stimulated cells ) per condition and per experiments were counted in three independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean\u00b1 SD .

Coverslips were incubated in a sterile solution of sodium bicarbonate ( 0 . 1 M , pH 9 . 5 ) for 1h at 37 \u00b0C . Coverslips were then incubated with poly - L - lysine 0 . 01 % ( Sigma , diluted in water ) for 1h at 37\u00b0C , washed once with PBS , dried and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with the desired antibody ( mCherry antibody or anti - rabbit A647 from Invitrogen ; \ufb01 nal concentration of 1 . 25 \u00b5g / ml ) diluted in the bicarbonate solution . Acrylamide gels were \ufb01 rst coated with Protein G ( Sigma ) diluted in sodium bicarbonate ( 0 . 1M , pH 9 . 5 ) to a \ufb01 nal concentration of 5 \u00b5g / ml for 1h at 37\u00b0C , then treated with poly - L - lysine 0 . 01 % ( Sigma , diluted in water ) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C , washed once with PBS , dried and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with the desired antibody . Acrylamide gels of controlled stiffness . Coverslips or \ufb02 uorodishes were incu - bated with APTMS ( 3 \u2010 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ) for 15min at RT , then washed extensively with water and incubated for 30min with Glutaraldehyde 0 . 5 % in PBS and washed again with water . Acrylamide 40 % and bis - acrylamide 2 % were mixed ( respectively 5 % and 0 . 04 % for 0 . 1 kPa gels , 7 . 5 % and 0 . 06 % for 5 kPa gels , 18 % and 0 . 4 % for 31 . 7 kPa gels , and 16 % and 0 . 96 % for 80 kPa ) with PBS , APS 10 % and TEMED . 9\u00b5l of this solution were polymerized on the treated glass . Gels were washed with PBS , followed by a 30 min incubation with 300 \u03bc l 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 + 100 \u03bc l sulfo - sampah ( 1 mg / ml in 50mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ) + 100 \u03bc l EDC ( 10 mg / ml in 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ) . Gels were subsequently cross - linked under UV light for 10min , washed and incubated with 50\u00b5g / ml collagen - I for 1h at 37 \u00b0C . Elasticity of the different gels was controlled by Atomic Force Microscopy as indicated in Betz et al . 44 The generation of 80 kPa gels was performed according to a previously published protocol 45 . Micropatterns . Coverslips were cleaned by washing in 70 % ethanol and sub - sequent irradiated under UV light for 5 min . The activated side of the coverslips was then covered with 0 . 1 mg / ml PLL - g - PEG ( Surface Solutions , Zurich ) for 1 h at RT . Coverslips were then washed twice in water and ring - shaped areas were exposed to deep UV during 5min using a photomask . Coverslips were recovered and coated with Alexa - 568 - labeled Collagen - I at 50 \u00b5g / ml overnight at 37 \u00b0C . The following day , 50 - 80 , 000 HeLa cells were plated on micropatterns in complete medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin . Cells were either \ufb01 xed or imaged 5 \u2013 6 h after plating . Eight to ten cells per experiment were measured per experiments in three independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean\u00b1 SD . Electron microscopy of unroofed cells . HeLa cells were plated on Poly - L - lysine coated coverslips in 12 well plates . 24h after plating , medium was aspirated and replaced with 4ml of stabilization buffer ( 3 mM EGTA , 5mM MgCl 2 , 70mM KCl , 30 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 ) . To unroof cells , 1ml of 2 % PFA was pipetted directly on the cells with a pipette kept perpendicular to the glass at 1mm from the surface . The coverslips were then immediately transferred to 2 % glutaraldehyde for 30min and then left in Cacodylate buffer . Scanning electron microscopy observations of unroofed HeLa cells were performed as previously described 46 . Brie \ufb02 y , \ufb01 xed HeLa cells were dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations . Critical point was dried using carbon dioxide in a Leica EMCPD300 . After coating with 2 nm platinum , cells were examined with a FEI Quanta FEG250 scanning electron microscope . Spinning disk microscopy of live cells . Cells were imaged at 5 s intervals for the indicated time using a spinning disk microscope ( Andor ) based on a CSU - W1 Yokogawa head mounted on the lateral port of an inverted IX - 83 Olympus microscope equipped with a \u00d760 1 . 35NA UPLSAPO objective lens and a laser combiner system , which included 491 and 561 nm 100mW DPSS lasers ( Andor ) . Images were acquired with a Zyla sCMOS camera ( Andor ) . The system was steered by IQ3 software ( Andor ) . For CCS dynamics quanti \ufb01 cation , we measured the lifetime of CCSs using the TrackMate plugin of ImageJ 47 . Tracks below 5 s of duration ( detected on only 1 frame ) were discarded . Measured individual lifetimes were pooled into two groups : the \u201c dynamic \u201d group corresponding to structures with a lifetime below the duration of the movie ( 5 min ) and the \u201c static \u201d group with a lifetime of 5min . Of note , the relative percentage of dynamic versus static structures depends on the duration of the movie because static structures are only counted once while NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 3825 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 06367 - y | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 dynamic structures continuously nucleate and disappear during the movie . For this reason , all quanti \ufb01 cations of CCS dynamics represent the relative number of static or dynamic events detectable at the plasma membrane at a given time point . At least 1000 CCSs from at least \ufb01 ve cells per conditions and per experiments were tracked in 3 \u2013 5 independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean \u00b1SD . To measure Auxillin bursts , cells were imaged at 1 frame every 2s for 3 min . Then , trypsin to a \ufb01 nal concentration of 0 . 0375 % was added and imaging was immediately started until disappearance of plaques . Ninety structures ( plaques ) from a total of six cells were analyzed from two independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean\u00b1 SD . Total internal re \ufb02 ection \ufb02 uorescence microscopy . For total internal re \ufb02 ection \ufb02 uorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) , HeLa cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were imaged through a \u00d7100 1 . 49 NA TIRF objective lens on a Nikon TE2000 ( Nikon France SAS , Champigny sur Marne , France ) inverted microscope equipped with a QuantEM EMCCD camera ( Roper Scienti \ufb01 c SAS , Evry , France / Photo - metrics , AZ , USA ) , a dual output laser launch , which included 491 and 561 nm 50 mW DPSS lasers ( Roper Scienti \ufb01 c ) , and driven by Metamorph 7 software ( MDS Analytical Technologies , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . A motorized device driven by Metamorph allowed the accurate positioning of the illumination light for evanes - cent wave excitation . Stimulated - emission - depletion microscopy . Image acquisitions were performed with a \u00d7100 oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) through gated Continuous Wave ( gCW ) Stimulated - emission - depletion ( STED ) imaging ( TCS SP8 - 3\u00d7 ; Leica Microsystems ) with optimized parameters for Alexa Fluor 568 detection . Samples ( zoom 4 , pixel size = 14 nm ) were excited with a 575 nm wavelength of a super - continuum laser and a 660 - nm laser for depletion . For Alexa Fluor 568 , 30 % AOTF , conventional scanner ( 400Hz , Line Average 2 , Accumulation 4 ) and 50 % of depletion lasers were used . Fluorescence ( 585 \u2013 630 nm ) was collected with a hybrid detector ( Gain 30 % ) in the gated mode ( 0 . 5 \u2013 6ns ) and a pinhole for 1 Airy Unit . Deconvolution of raw data from STED imaging was obtained through image processing with Huygens professional 4 . 5 . 1 software . Cell proliferation assays . Cells were seeded at a density of 100 , 000 per well in 12 wells plates coated with 50\u00b5g / ml collagen - I , or 0 . 5\u00b5g / ml vitronectin , or uncoated .

Here we use a three - dimensional model of a motile endocytic invagination ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) to investigate factors affecting elongation of the invaginations . We found that differences in turgor pressure in the two yeast species can largely explain the paradoxical differences observed experimentally in endocytic motility . INTRODUCTION As in plant cells , endocytosis in yeast cells occurs under high turgor pressure estimated to be \u223c 10 atm in fission yeast ( Basu et al . , 2014 ; Lacy et al . , 2018 ) and about a fifth to half of that in budding yeast ( de Maranon et al . , 1996 ; Schaber et al . , 2010 ) . Transient assembly of small , dense networks of actin filaments at endocytic sites ( termed \u201cactin patches\u201d ) is necessary for robust endocytosis in yeast ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Basu et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting that assembly of an actin patch around a nascent invagi - nation of the plasma membrane may generate a pulling force suffi - cient to elongate the invagination under such pressures . Many stud - ies have investigated the mechanisms of force generation at endocytic sites in yeast ( Carlsson and Bayly , 2014 ; Scher - Zagier and Carlsson , 2016 ; Carlsson , 2018 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Lacy et al . , 2018 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) . A comparative study of endocytosis in fission and budding yeast ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) found that with the exception of twofold more polymerized actin in fission yeast the abundances of proteins partici - pating in patch assembly are more similar than previously thought . Nevertheless , elongation of an endocytic invagination is twofold faster ( \u223c 52 nm / s ) in fission yeast than in budding yeast ( \u223c 24 nm / s ) . The fast elongation rates in both yeasts indicate that driving forces generated at endocytic sites substantially overpower resistance from turgor pressure , not just withstand it . For the turgor pressure of 10 atm , a rough estimation of a resist - ing force acting on a cylindrical tubule with a typical radius of \u223c 30 nm yields \u223c 3000 pN ( Carlsson , 2018 ; Lacy et al . , 2018 ) . Simulations based on a spatial model of a motile invagination proposed by Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) showed that an actin patch assembling around such a tubule can generate tangential pulling forces of \u223c 2500 pN that can withstand a turgor pressure of \u223c 9 atm . For lower turgor pressures , the tubule would elongate , albeit slowly , for ex - ample , at only \u223c 2 nm / s against a turgor pressure of \u223c 7 atm . Yet the simulations of the model made another prediction that the assembling patch would also generate normal forces , which squeeze the tubule at its base and stretch it at its middle , thus trans - forming the invagination shape from cylindrical to flasklike ( or \u201chead \u2013 neck\u201d ) as observed in electron micrographs of budding yeast ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Buser and Drubin , 2013 ) . Previous mod - eling studies also predicted endocytic invaginations with head \u2013 neck shapes ( Dmitrieff and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec , 2015 ; Ma and Berro , 2021 ) . Since the resisting force is the product of turgor pressure and the cross - sectional area at the base of the invagination , the transition to the Monitoring Editor Alex Mogilner New York University Received : Jul 20 , 2021 Revised : Nov 23 , 2021 Accepted : Dec 10 , 2021 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Nickaeen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell head \u2013 neck shape may dramatically reduce resistance due to turgor pressure , leading to faster elongation rates even for turgor pres - sures of \u223c 10 atm . Our previous study , as well as works of others ( Carlsson and Bayly , 2014 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ) , modeled the invaginations as sphe - rocylinders . In those simulations , we approximated the reduction in resistance due to the putative shape change by replacing fixed re - sistance with a resistance decreasing over time . The elongation rate increased fourfold , to \u223c 8 nm / s , which is still significantly lower than the 25 \u2013 50 nm / s range reported by Sun et al . , ( 2019 ) . In this study , we solved our model in geometries mimicking flask - like invaginations . The solutions yielded higher driving forces , be - cause , in contrast with cylindrical shapes for which pulling forces are viscous in nature , active stresses also contribute to the forces driving flasklike invaginations . Consistent with the experimental data ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) , invagination is faster and deeper at high turgor pres - sures , because at higher initial resistance , more actin filaments ac - cumulate by the time the driving force overcomes the resistance , producing higher driving forces during elongation . RESULTS Model Our model , described in detail in Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) , couples kinetics of actin nucleation , polymerization , and turnover con - strained by counts of each participating protein over time ( Berro et al . , 2010 ) , with the mechanics of the assembling filamentous meshwork approximated as that of a visco - active gel ( Kruse et al . 2005 ; Prost et al . , 2015 ) . Mathematically , the model consists of ad - vection - reaction equations governing densities of proteins involved in patch assembly ( see Eq ( S1 ) in the Supplemental Material ) , and a force - balance equation yielding actin velocities [ Eq ( S2 ) of the Sup - plemental Material ] . In the advection - reaction equations , reaction rates and rate constants from the experimental literature ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; see also Supplemental Table S1 in the Supplemental Material ) were modified to reflect effects of forces and filament den - sities on polymerization kinetics . The equation , which governs actin flow , balances active forces , originating from impingement of po - lymerized subunits on existing filaments , with viscous forces that arise due to entanglement and cross - linking of branched filaments . The active and viscous forces derive , respectively , from repulsive and viscous stresses in the meshwork of overlapping actin filaments , which are both proportional to the square of local density of poly - merized subunits ; the viscous stresses are also proportional to the local average of filament lengths [ Gardel et al . , 2003 ; Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ; see also Eq ( S3 ) in the Supplemental Material ] . The co - efficients determining scales of the stresses were inferred from rheo - logical properties of actin filament networks ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Gardel et al . , 2003 ; Tseng and Wirtz , 2004 ) . Through interactions with the membrane , the flow of polymer - ized actin exerts on the invagination driving forces parallel to its axis . The resultant driving force ( f drive ) and resistance due to turgor pres - sure ( f resist ) are the factors determining elongation rate in our model . We ignore small resistive forces due to membrane surface tension . We also assume sufficient supply of lipids by way of exocytosis and lateral diffusion and impose no constraint on total area of the invagi - nated membrane . To determine the time - dependent driving force f drive ( t ) , we inte - grate over the surface of the invagination , for each t , the active and viscous forces exerted on the invagination by actin flow and then project the resultant force on the invagination axis [ see Supplemen - tal Material , Eq ( S4 ) ] . As mentioned in the Introduction , the resistive force can also depend on time , even at a fixed turgor pressure . Indeed , our previ - ous study revealed that an assembling actin patch produces not only a pulling force but also generates orthogonal forces that squeeze the base of the invagination and stretch its middle ( Figure 1A ) . As actin filaments accumulate around a nascent spherocylindri - cal invagination , squeezing forces at the base of the invagination can reach the magnitude amounting to additional pressure of \u223c 8 . 5 atm ( Figure 1B ) . It is therefore likely that at some point during patch assembly , the nascent invaginations , such as the one shown in Figure 1A , acquire head \u2013 neck shapes ( Figure 1C ) . Such shapes were observed in electron micrographs of invaginations in budding yeast ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Buser and Drubin , 2013 ) and predicted theo - retically for a membrane elongated under high turgor pressure by a point force exerted at its tip ( Dmitrieff and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec , 2015 ; Ma and Berro , 2021 ) . Because turgor pressure is isotropic and thus pushes on the upper surface of the head of the invagination as well , the transition from cylindrical shape to flasklike shape , such as in Figure 1C , results in f resist ( t ) decreasing with time ( Figure 1D ) . We specify this function later in this subsection ( see also Figure 1D , Eq ( 2 ) below , and Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) ] . Solving for dynamics of the invagination shape would involve mechanics of a moving membrane ( Powers , 2010 ) and require FIGURE 1 : An assembling endocytic actin patch exerts strong squeezing forces at its base of an initial invagination .

( C ) Cartoon of a head \u2013 neck ( flasklike ) shape with radii r neck and R head ; since turgor pressure P is isotropic , f resist for this shape diminishes to \u03c0 r P neck 2 .

Volume 33 March 1 , 2022 Modeling endocytic motility in yeast | 3 reliable experimental data describing rheological characteristics of both the membrane and its protein coat . Lacking this information , we initialize invaginations as already having head \u2013 neck shapes with specified head and neck radii R head and r neck , which do not change as the neck elongates . As in Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) , we assume that all points of the membrane move with the same speed u ( t ) de - scribed by a linear force - velocity relation , ( ) ( ) ( ) = \u00b5\u22c5 \u2212 \uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb u t f t f t drive resist ( 1 ) where \u03bc is the invagination mobility coefficient . The inverse of the mobility , representing \u201cresistivity\u201d of the invagination with respect to a net driving force , is likely determined by viscosity of the mem - brane and its protein coat , including links to actin filaments . Our model is only modestly sensitive to \u03bc ( see The head \u2013 neck invagi - nations elongate faster and to greater depths under higher turgor pressures ) , so this parameter is not critical for explaining the twofold differences in elongation rates and depths reported in Sun et al . ( 2019 ) . Note that for the invagination to elongate , the driving force must exceed the resistance of turgor pressure ; therefore , Eq . ( 1 ) holds only for f t f t drive resist ( ) ( ) \u2265 , whereas for f t f t u t , 0 drive resist ( ) ( ) ( ) < = . Because the resistance of turgor pressure is proportional to the invagination cross - section area near its base ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) , we can gain insight into general behavior of f resist ( t ) by estimating the time dependence of this area , A ( t ) , for the example illustrated by Figure 1A . To compute the resistive force normalized to its maxi - mum , ( ) ( ) ( ) = \u03c0 f t f A t R / / max resist resist head2 , where = \u03c0 f R P max resist head2 and P is the turgor pressure , we assumed Hookean elasticity of the protein coat for this case ( i . e . , that the diameter of the opening decreases in proportion to the squeezing force shown in Figure 1B ) with such stiff - ness that the opening would close when the squeezing force reached its maximum . Notably , the results ( dotted curve in Figure 1D ) are accurately fitted by the function { } ( ) + \u2212 \u03c4 \uf8ee\uf8f0 \uf8f9\uf8fb \u2212 t t 1 exp / 0 1 with suitable timing t 0 and duration \u03c4 of the resistance descent ( solid curve in Figure 1D with t 0 \u2248 11 . 1 s and \u03c4 \u2248 1 . 2 s ) . While the assumptions made above may be simplistic ( e . g . , the coat elasticity may not be Hookean ) , the formulation of f resist ( t ) in terms of the timing and dura - tion of the resistance drop is fairly general . We therefore approxi - mate the resistive force in this study by the following function of time , f t R P e 1 t t resist head2 0 ( ) = \u03c0 + \u2212 \u03c4 ( 2 ) and treat t 0 and \u03c4 as model parameters [ see also Eq ( 2 * ) in The head \u2013 neck invaginations elongate faster and to greater depths un - der higher turgor pressures ] . Note that because the reduction of resistance occurs due to the shape change , t 0 in our model also represents the time around which the transition to a head \u2013 neck shape takes place . Nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) \u2014the proteins that stimu - late Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate branched actin filaments\u2014reside on the invaginating membrane where they concentrate in narrow rings around the membrane . Fission yeast has two rings of NPFs , one that remains in the initial position at the base of the invagination at the plasma membrane and the other that moves with the tip of the tubule ( Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Arasada et al . , 2018 ) , whereas budding yeast has one ring of NPFs that remains near the base of the invagination ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . As with cylindrical shapes ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) , simulations of both arrangements of NPFs on head \u2013 neck surfaces yielded similar elongation rates and tip displacements . To avoid duplication , we employ the two - zone ar - rangement of NPFs characteristic of fission yeast to illustrate our findings throughout this paper . In summary , we assume that a nascent endocytic invagination begins to elongate when the driving force exerted on it by the assembling actin patch overcomes resistance of turgor pressure , and that the elongation rate is proportional to the difference of the two forces [ ( Eq ( 1 ) ] . Dynamics of the driving force depend on mechanical stresses developing in the patch . Thus the driving force is ultimately determined by the nucleation and polymeriza - tion kinetics of actin and by the flow of actin filaments . The latter is governed by local force balance in the patch subjected to a no - slip condition at the interface with the invaginated mem - brane . Given that the invagination shape likely transforms in the process from cylindrical to flasklike , we further assume that the turgor resistance decreases with time [ Eq ( 2 ) ] . A mathematical description of the model and its numerical solution are detailed in the Supplemental Material [ Eqs ( S1 ) \u2013 ( S4 ) ] and in Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) . Because the invaginations in our model are axially symmetric , we compute and present actin densities in ( r , z ) coordinates ( see Methods ) . Changing the shape of the invagination from cylindrical to flasklike amplifies driving forces , yielding faster elongation and longer displacements If only the reduction of resistance , described by Eq ( 2 ) , is taken into account , cylindrical invaginations did not elongate as fast as ob - served experimentally ( see Introduction ) . Seeking faster elonga - tions , we noted that the shape change should also affect the driving force . Indeed , driving forces originate from stresses in the actin fila - ment meshwork surrounding the invagination , and while the forces pulling cylindrical invaginations derive from viscous stresses , the driving forces exerted on curved invaginations would have addi - tional contributions from active stresses due to the actin flow push - ing on the upper surface of the invagination head . This would not only increase the driving force during elongation but might also make elongation rates more sensitive to the invagination mobility coefficient \u03bc [ Eq ( 1 ) ] . The elongation rates of cylindrical invaginations are essentially insensitive to \u03bc because the viscous driving forces depend on shear rates of actin flow at the invagination that are lower for invaginations with higher mobility ( see the black and gray dashed curves in Figure 3 , A and B discussed later in this section ) . As a result , the increase of \u03bc is counterbalanced by the drop in the viscous pulling force , leav - ing the elongation rate u ( t ) virtually unchanged ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , the forces driving a flasklike invagination might be less sensitive to reductions in shear rates . The reason is that ac - tive stresses are by definition independent of shear rates and so are their contributions to the driving force . We tested these hypotheses by solving the model in geome - tries mimicking invaginations with head \u2013 neck shapes . To maxi - mize elongation rates , we explored shapes with small ratios r neck / R head ( the head radius was fixed at 30 nm ) . Given the re - ported similarity of protein abundances in fission and budding yeast , we ran all simulations with the same set of reaction rate constants and abundances of soluble proteins taken from Berro et al . ( 2010 ) and Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) . Similarly , we uniformly applied coefficients setting the scales for active and viscous stresses as they were derived in our previous study . Results were consistent with our expectations , as exemplified by a solution obtained for an invagination with r neck / R head = 0 . 1 ( Figure 2 ) using the same parameters as for the cylindrical invagination in our 4 | M . Nickaeen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell previous study ( Figure 7 in Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) , with the excep - tion of the mobility coefficient value \u03bc = 0 . 08 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) , which is twice the one used for the cylindrical invagination 1 . The snapshots of the ( r , z ) sections in Figure 2A correspond to the beginning of elongation ( left ) , actin half - maximum ( middle ) , and actin peak ( right ) . The times in this figure and below are offset by \u2013 20 s so that on the transformed scale , actin peaks , which are thought to coincide with the scission of the endocytic vesicle ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) , occur around time zero ( Figure 2B ) . Thus the offset readings are close to times before scission . A nascent invagination begins to elongate ( Figure 2D ) at the time t begin when the solid curve in Figure 2C , depicting the driving force , intersects with the dashed graph of the resistance of turgor pressure . FIGURE 2 : Modeling an elongating invagination with head \u2013 neck shape . We simulated elongation of the head \u2013 neck invagination described by r neck / R head = 0 . 1 using the following parameters : P = 9 atm , t 0 = \u2013 7 s ( 13 s into patch assembly ) , \u03c4 = 0 . 66 s , and \u03bc = 0 . 08 nm / s / pN . Similar to experimental studies , the time here and below is offset by \u2013 20 s so that the times of actin peaks would be around time zero . ( A ) The ( r , z ) sections of 3D distributions of actin densities ( pseudocolors ) and velocities ( white arrows ) are shown for three times : ( left ) beginning of elongation , ( middle ) actin half maximum , and ( right ) actin peak . Extracellular space is white ; vertical dashed lines represent the axis of symmetry of model geometry . Velocity scale bars correspond to 60 nm / s . ( B ) Polymerized actin as a function of time . The numbers of subunits were counted inside a growing cylinder embedding the moving invagination : r cyl = 0 . 06 \u03bcm , \u222b \u03b4 ( ) = + + \u2032 \u2032 z l l u t dt cyl t t begin , where t begin denotes the beginning of elongation and lengths are in \u03bcm : the initial invagination length l = 0 . 07 \u03bcm and short extra length \u03b4 l = 0 . 003 \u03bcm . ( C ) Time dependence of driving force ( solid curve ) and resistance due to turgor pressure described by Eq ( 2 ) ( dashed curve ) ; the invagination mobility used is \u03bc = 0 . 08 \u03bcm / s / pN . ( D ) Displacement is \u223c 180 nm at the time actin peaks , which is thought to coincide with scission , yielding average elongation rate \u223c 30 nm / s over the duration of elongation , t scission \u2013 t begin . In this particular example , t begin coincides with t 0 , but generally may deviate from it , as discussed in the next section . The driving force , rising at t < t begin , starts \u201cshadowing\u201d the descending f resist ( t ) immediately after t begin ( Figure 2C ) . This transition is largely a result of an abrupt drop of the viscous com - ponent of f drive caused by the decrease in the shear rate , as the moving invagination catches up with the surrounding actin flow . Assuming the vesicle scission coincides with the time of maximum actin , the simu - lated duration of elongation is 6 . 2 s . Notably , the maximum displacement 179 nm ( Figure 2D ) yielded by the model is within the range of displacements measured in yeast : \u223c 125 nm in budding yeast and \u223c 200 nm in fission yeast ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) . The average elonga - tion rate is then 179 nm / 6 . 2 s = 28 . 9 nm / s . The maximum elongation rate , achieved at t = \u2013 3 . 3 s , is 38 nm / s . Both the average and the maximum values are in the range of speeds reported by Sun et al . ( 2019 ) . Thus , solving the model in geometries mimicking curved flasklike invaginations and with the amplified invagination mobility produced elongation rates and displacements compa - rable with experimental data . The factors contributing to the greater speeds and displacements can be elucidated further by comparing simulations that differ only by invagination shape and mobility . For this , we reran the simulation described above with \u03bc = 0 . 04 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) and compared re - sults of both simulations with the solutions of the same model for the cylindrical invagina - tion with \u03bc = 0 . 04 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) from our previ - ous study and for the cylindrical invagination with \u03bc = 0 . 08 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) ( Figure 3 ) . Changing the shape from cylindrical to flasklike produced a threefold higher maxi - mum of the net driving force , f net ( t ) = f drive ( t ) \u2013 f resist ( t ) ( dotted and black dashed curves in Figure 3A ) . Because all four solutions were obtained with the same f resist ( t ) , the higher f net reflects the anticipated increase of f drive . Note that both head - neck and cy - lindrical invaginations with higher mobility experience lower f net ( dotted vs . solid and black vs . gray dashed curves in Figure 3A ) be - cause the contributions of viscous stresses to f drive depend on shear rates , which are lower for higher \u03bc , as discussed above . Yet overall , the elongation rates u ( t ) = \u03bc f net ( t ) are noticeably faster for the head \u2013 neck invagination with the higher \u03bc ( solid and dotted curves in Figure 3B ) , which validates the prediction that the elongation of curved invaginations is more sensitive to \u03bc than that of the cylindri - cal invaginations ( dashed curves in Figure 3 , B and C ) . The maxi - mum elongation rates in Figure 3B were as follows : ( solid curve ) 38 . 0 nm / s , ( dotted curve ) 31 . 2 nm / s , ( black dashed curve ) 9 . 9 nm / s , and ( gray dashed curve ) 10 . 5 nm / s . Higher elongation rates trans - late into larger maximal dispacements z u t dt ( ) t t tip begin scission \u222b \u2206 = \u2032 \u2032 , where t scission is intepreted as the time of the peak of actin ( Figure 3C ) . The Figure 3 legend gives the values of t begin and t scission for each of 1 All simulations in our previous study were run with \u03bc = 0 . 04 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) , not \u03bc = 0 . 4 nm / ( s\u2219pN ) as misstated in Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) . The typographical error had no effect on the results of Nickaeen et al . ( 2019 ) . Volume 33 March 1 , 2022 Modeling endocytic motility in yeast | 5 the solutions . Based on these data , the average elongation rates u z t t / scission begin ( ) = \u2206 \u2212 are ( solid curve ) 28 . 9 nm / s , ( dotted curve ) 23 . 9 nm / s , ( black dashed curve ) 7 . 7 nm / s , and ( gray dashed curve ) 8 . 3 nm / s . In this study , we do not explicitly model the transition of a nascent cylindrical invagination into a flask shape . Instead , initial invaginations in our simulations are already of a head \u2013 neck shape , with R head and r neck that the invagination would assume as a result of shape change . Obviously , this contradicts the premise of Eq ( 2 ) that the transforma - tion of shape occurs around time t 0 . However , the errors caused by this inconsistency are likely small for two reasons . First , both the time dependence of the driving force before elongation and t begin are es - sentially independent of initial shape . Indeed , according to Figure 3 , the cylindrical and head \u2013 neck invaginations , simulated with the same f resist ( t ) , begin to elongate at approximately the same time , suggest - ing that during the time before the elongation , f drive ( t ) is similar for all shapes . Simulations of invaginations with different r neck / R head and f resist ( t ) , described in the next section , also show that the pre - elonga - tion f drive ( t ) are virtually independent of shape ( see Figure 4A ) . This gives us leeway in defining shapes during the time before the elonga - tion . Second , by using at t < t begin a fixed head \u2013 neck shape with the head and neck radii that would arise from shape transformation , we capture a makeup of the driving force in terms of active and viscous components at t = t begin . Unlike the total driving force , the pre - elon - gation active and viscous components significantly depend on shape , and the composition of f drive ( t ) at = t begin in terms of these compo - nents defines the behavior of the driving force during elongation and , ultimately , the characteristics of motility of the invagination . The head \u2013 neck invaginations elongate faster and to greater depths under higher turgor pressures One might assume that elongation would be fastest if the resistive force were fixed at a low value . However , simulations of a head \u2013 neck invagination moving against a constant resistive force of 28 . 3 pN yielded average elongation rates of only \u223c 15 nm / s ( Table 1 ) in spite of resistance two orders of magnitude lower than experienced by a cylindrical invagination under a turgor pressure of 10 atm . This counterintuitive behavior arises because the driving force overcomes the resistance early during patch formation . At this point , the actin flow is slow and the viscous component dominates the driving force , resulting in slow elongation . When the active com - ponent subsequently grows stronger , the viscous component de - creases and even becomes resistive . These factors keep the overall driving force down , yielding relatively slow rates during the entire elongation . Conversely , a stronger and longer lasting initial resis - tance gives the driving force a chance to build up and may produce faster elongation rates and deeper invaginations once the driving force overcomes the resistance . To test this prediction , we compared simulations with lower tur - gor pressure representative of budding yeast and the other with high turgor pressures characteristic of fission yeast . We also varied the invagination mobility coefficient \u03bc and the parameter t 0 approxi - mating the timing of shape change ; as above , t 0 was offset by \u2013 20 s . In all simulations , the neck \u2013 head ratio was r neck / R head = 0 . 1 and the duration of shape change was \u03c4 = 0 . 33 s . Table 2 summarizes the simulation parameters and results including : the duration of elonga - tion computed as t scission \u2013 t begin with t scission intepreted as the time FIGURE 3 : Invaginations with \u201chead \u2013 neck\u201d shape have higher driving forces than cylindrical invaginations , yielding faster elongation and longer displacements . Dependence of ( A ) net driving force , f net = f drive \u2013 f resist , ( B ) elongation rates , and ( C ) displacements on the invagination geometry and \u03bc . The model was solved with the same parameters ( with the exception of invagination mobility ) for the invagination with head \u2013 neck shape ( r neck / R head = 0 . 1 ) and mobility coefficients \u03bc = 0 . 08 \u03bcm / s / pN ( solid curves ) and 0 . 04 \u03bcm / s / pN ( dotted curves ) and for the cylindrical invagination with \u03bc = 0 . 08 \u03bcm / s / pN ( gray dashed curves ) and 0 . 04 \u03bcm / s / pN ( black dashed curves ) . The head \u2013 neck invaginations began to move at t begin = \u2013 7 s , and the cylindrical invaginations started to elongate at t begin = \u2013 6 . 8 s . Vesicle scission , terminating elongation , is thought to occur when polymerized actin reaches its maximum . For the head \u2013 neck invaginations , t scission = \u2013 0 . 8 s for \u03bc = 0 . 08 \u03bcm / s / pN and \u2013 0 . 6 s for \u03bc = 0 . 04 \u03bcm / s / pN , and for the cylindrical invaginations , t scission = 0 s for \u03bc = 0 . 04 \u03bcm / s / pN and 0 . 9 s for \u03bc = 0 . 08 \u03bcm / s / pN . The displacements at t scission were 179 nm ( solid curve ) , 153 nm ( dotted curve ) , 64 nm ( gray dashed curve ) , and 52 nm ( black dashed curve ) .

Nickaeen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell of the peak of actin , the maximum displacement defined as the dis - placements at t t scission = , the average elongation rate ( the ratio of the maximum displacement and the corresponding duration of elongation ) , and the peak amount of polymerized actin computed as described in the Figure 2 legend . As predicted , the simulated elongation rates were faster and the displacements longer at higher turgor pressures . Also , the timing of the resistance reduction t 0 correlated positively with elongation rates ( see simulations 2 and 3 ) and the simulation outcomes were only modestly sensitive to \u03bc , consistent with results in Figure 3 , B and C . While both P and t 0 influence the motility of invaginations ( Table 2 ) , the impact of P is overarching because turgor pressure limits the effect of t 0 on both t begin and f drive ( t ) at t > t begin . Indeed , both f drive ( t begin ) and t begin saturate with increasing t 0 at the values controlled by turgor pressure , R P head2 \u03c0 and f R P drive \u2013 1 head2 ( ) \u03c0 , respec - tively [ f drive \u2013 1 stands for the inverse function of f drive ( t ) ] . This is because the time t begin is the solution of f drive ( t ) = f resist ( t ) and f resist ( t ) \u2264 R P head2 \u03c0 [ Eq ( 2 ) ] ; note also that f drive ( t begin ) is the absolute maximum of f drive ( t ) ( Figures 1 , C and D , and 3 , A and C ) . The saturation begins at t f R P 0 . 8 0 drive \u2013 1 head2 ( ) \u2248 \u03c0 + 1 . 3 \u03c4 , for which f t R P 0 . 8 resist begin head2 ( ) \u2248 \u03c0 ( see the Supplemental Material ) . Interestingly , the \u201cnear - saturation\u201d values of t 0 used in simulations 1 , 2 , and 6 \u2013 9 ( Table 2 ) resulted in longer elongations at lower turgor pressures , which is consistent with results in Figure 3 of Sun et al . ( 2019 ) . The simulation results in Table 2 agree qualitatively with the ob - servations that invaginations in budding yeast move slower and are shorter than in fission yeast ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) , which is consistent with the different turgor pressures explaining these differences in the two species . Quantitatively , though , our simulations significantly overestimated the displacements in budding yeast . Note also that the elongation rates in simulations 3 and 9 are similar to those in budding and fission yeast , but they were obtained with the fourfold difference of the invagination mobility in the two yeasts , which may not be realistic . We ran additional simulations with varying model parameters to find better agreement with reported data . Simulations with para - meter sets termed \u201coptimized\u201d ( Table 3 ) yielded results more con - sistent with the measurements by Sun et al . ( 2019 ) ( Table 4 ) . In these sets , mobility coefficients \u03bc and durations of resistance reduction \u03c4 are similar for both yeasts . Parameters that differ include turgor pressure P , pressure - dependent \u201cnear - saturation\u201d values of t 0 , and neck \u2013 head ratios r neck / R head ( recall that all simulations in Table 2 FIGURE 4 : Output of simulations of models using optimized parameters for budding yeast ( gray curves ) and fission yeast ( black curves ) .

Volume 33 March 1 , 2022 Modeling endocytic motility in yeast | 7 were run with the same r neck / R head = 0 . 1 ) . The shapes of the invagi - nations may differ in the two species because of different normal forces or rigidities of the protein coat , or both . The coat rigidities are unknown , but the compressing force might be weaker in budding yeast because of lower turgor pressure , which contributes to squeez - ing the invagination neck , so the invaginations in budding yeast would likely have larger ratios r neck / R head . We solved the model for budding yeast with two values of r neck / R head . Simulations with r neck / R head = 1 / 5 ( r neck = 6 nm ) yielded elongation rates closer to the observations , whereas simulations with r neck / R head = 1 / 3 ( r neck = 10 nm ) better approximated the observed displacements ( Table 4 ) . We introduced additional minor changes to simulations run with optimized parameters , aimed at improving the overall consistency of the model and the agreement of the simulation results with ex - perimental observations . We replaced Eq ( 2 ) with a more accurate version of f resist ( t ) that after the invagination changes shape does not drop to zero but rather approaches Pr neck2 \u03c0 , f t PR r R e r R 1 ( / ) 1 ( / ) t t resist head2 neck head 2 neck head 2 0 ( ) = \u03c0 \u2212 + + \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 \u03c4 ( 2 * ) In determining durations of elongation and average elongation rates , we took into account that immediately after t begin , the invagi - nations elongate much slower than during the ensuing near - linear increase in displacement ( see Figures 1D and 2C ) . Similar to the experimental study ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) , we evaluated the elongation durations and rates for the fast near - linear increase of displace - ments , starting at the inflection point and ending when polymerized actin reaches its maximum . The inflection points of the displace - ment time dependencies for the budding yeast invaginations were \u2013 6 . 9 s with r neck / R head = 1 / 5 and \u2013 6 . 8 s with r neck / R head = 1 / 3 and \u2013 2 . 8 s for fission yeast with r neck / R head = 0 . 1 . The corresponding end times were \u2013 1 . 2 s , \u2013 0 . 8 s , and 1 . 9 s . Figure 4 compares results for budding and fission yeast obtained with the optimized parameter sets . Graphs in panels A and B illus - trate how turgor pressure affects f drive ( t ) and f net ( t ) = f drive ( t ) \u2013 f resist ( t ) . In panel A the dashed curves are f resist ( t ) described by Eq ( 2 * ) with the maximum resistance R P head2 \u03c0 controlled by turgor pressure and thus is lower in budding yeast . Consequently , in budding yeast elongation begins earlier during patch assembly and requires a weaker driving force , yielding lower f net ( panel B ) , slower elongation , and shorter displacements ( panel C ) . Simulation results obtained with optimized parameter sets agree reasonably well with the experimental data of Sun et al . ( 2019 ) ( Table 4 ) . The comparison reinforces the conclusion that different turgor pressures in the two yeast species are a major determinant in the observed differences of elongation rates and depths of their endo - cytic invaginations . The model predicts that the peak numbers of actin are lower in budding yeast than fission yeast Feedback between kinematics of the invagination and the accumu - lation of actin around the invagination explains why simulations of the model produce more polymerized actin in patches assembling under higher turgor pressures ( Table 2 ; Figure 4D ) in spite of using a fixed set of kinetic parameters for actin nucleation , polymerization , and severing ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) . Indeed , the amounts of actin polymerizing in patches under different turgor pressures are similar until the invaginations begin to move ( Figure 4D ) when the rate of polymerization and elongation increases abruptly ( Figure 2 , B and D ) . The velocities of actin filaments ( and of active Arp2 / 3 ) in the im - mediate vicinity of a stationary initial invagination are close to zero ( due to the no - slip condition reflecting the binding of actin filaments to the coat proteins ) , so actin dendritic nucleation is confined to a limited space around the invagination neck ( Figure 2A , left ) , and as the density of actin filaments increases over time , polymerization slows due to excluded volume effects . Once the invagination starts to move , its elongation speed and consequently the velocities of the filament network in the vicinity of the invagination increase sharply , as evident from the time dependences of net driving force ( Figure 4B ) [ recall that according to Eq ( 1 ) , u ( t ) \u221d f net ( t ) ] . As a result , the space where new filaments can nucleate and grow expands as well . Therefore , the rate with which the invagination elongates influ - ences the rate of actin accumulation in the patch , which is cumula - tively reflected in the peak amounts of polymerized actin ( Table 2 ) . The peak amounts of actin in endocytic patches estimated with traces of GFP - actin are \u223c 4100 \u2013 7500 subunits for fission yeast ( Sirot - kin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ) and \u223c 3600 subunits for budding yeast ( Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) . The maximum numbers of actin in patches are higher in the simulations than the experimental values for both yeasts , but the ratios are roughly similar : the opti - mized fission yeast parameters yielded the maximum of 9829 po - lymerized subunits , whereas simulations of budding yeast produced maxima of 5637 subunits with r neck / R head = 1 / 5 and 5165 subunits with r neck / R head = 1 / 3 .

Molecular Biology of the Cell results by integrating actin densities inside an elongating cylindrical surface that encompasses the high - density filament meshwork of the patch . The white rectangular box in Figure 5 represents a cross - section of this surface . Figure 5A is a snapshot of the actin density distribution at the time of maximum patch actin in fission yeast ( t = 1 . 9 s ) obtained with optimized parameters ( Table 3 ) . Note that the white box includes light - blue spaces with relatively low densities of actin filaments , which may not be detected experimentally . Contributions from such spaces can be eliminated by imposing a density threshold . Figure 5B shows a patch of filament meshwork with densities exceeding 6 mM . Such thresholding lowers the number of subunits from 9829 to 5469 subunits , in the range of the experimental estimates for fission yeast . Importantly , applying the same threshold to simulation results obtained with the budding yeast parameters ( Table 3 ) yielded a near proportionate decrease of the patch subunit count from 5637 to 2591 subunits for r neck / R head = 1 / 5 and from 5165 to 2489 subunits for r neck / R head = 1 / 3 , thus maintaining the approximately twofold ra - tio of the numbers of subunits in the patches of the two yeasts . The differences between the experimental estimates and simu - lated numbers of polymerized subunits may also reflect a modest bias against the incorporation of GFP - actin into filaments . DISCUSSION Sun et al . ( 2019 ) recorded endocytic events in budding and fission yeast in the same microscope field . The side - by - side comparison revealed remarkable similarities of the abundance of proteins at sites of endocytosis in the two yeasts , yet endocytic invaginations elongated twice as fast to twofold greater depths in fission yeast than budding yeast ( Sun et al . , 2019 ) . In this study , we show that a molecularly explicit model of forces exerted by actin filaments on endocytic invaginations ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) explains these differ - ences . Counterintuitively , higher turgor pressures favor faster , deeper membrane invaginations using the same parameters of ac - tin nucleation and polymerization . At the core of our theory is an observation that polymerization of a dense network of actin filaments around an endocytic invagination not only produces a driving force parallel to the axis of invagination but also exerts orthogonal forces that compress the base of the in - vagination and stretch its middle . If sufficiently strong , these forces deform the nascent , cylindrical invagination into a flasklike shape as observed in electron micrographs of invaginations in budding yeast ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Buser and Drubin , 2013 ) . The estimates of or - thogonal forces exerted by actin at the invagination base ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) amount to an extra squeezing pressure with the maxi - mum of \u223c 8 . 5 atm , transforming the invagination shape from cylindri - cal to flasklike . Interestingly , the flask shapes , also predicted by the models of a membrane pulled under high turgor pressure by a point force at its tip ( Dmitrieff and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec , 2015 ; Ma and Berro , 2021 ) , had wider necks than in electron micrographs . The orthogonal forces exerted by actin at the base of invagination could help nar - row the neck . The shape change , in turn , affects the driving and resistive forces . Since turgor pressure is isotropic , its resistance declines during the transition to a head \u2013 neck shape ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) . We find that this transition also changes composition of the driving force in terms of viscous and active components due to active stresses that the polymerization of the actin filament network pro - duces on the upper side of the invagination head . Once the driv - ing force overcomes the declining resistive force and the invagina - tion begins to elongate , the active component of the driving force becomes dominant and produces faster elongations and deeper invaginations ( Figure 3 ) . Further , we find that higher turgor pressure favors faster elonga - tions and longer displacements . For higher turgor pressure , the driv - ing force has a chance to grow before it matches higher initial resis - tance . This results in higher net driving force during elongation as the resistive force drops . Thus the difference of turgor pressure in the two yeasts is a plausible explanation for the observed differ - ences in motility characteristics of their endocytic invaginations . The model also predicts , in qualitative agreement with experi - mental data on actin accumulation in endocytic patches ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Arasada and Pollard , 2011 ; Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) , that the peak amounts of actin in the patches must be lower in bud - ding yeast than in fission yeast because of feedback between the elongation rate and the rate of actin accumulation . Another predic - tion is that the ratio r neck / R head of the invaginations is lower in bud - ding yeast than in fission yeast . The modeling in this study employs certain simplifications . We describe actin filament meshwork continuously in terms of concen - trations of proteins participating in actin assembly without resolving individual filaments . Given the large numbers of polymerized sub - units in the patch , this approach yields reasonably accurate results while avoiding logistical burdens of discrete stochastic simulations . In this approximation , the concentration of barbed ends serves as an estimate for the local filament density , and the ratio of the density of polymerized subunits to barbed ends estimates the local average number of subunits per filament . Our model does not include membrane mechanics and , there - fore we do not solve for shape dynamics . We model elongation of a head \u2013 neck invagination by increasing the length of its neck at a rate governed by Eq ( 1 ) without changing the predefined radii of the head or neck . Parameters associated with the shape of the invagina - tion , such as the ratio of radii r neck / R head and the time t 0 around which shape change takes place , are constrained by available experimental data . A more rigorous approach , based on mechanics of moving membranes ( Powers , 2010 ) , would yield the dynamic FIGURE 5 : Deriving the number of actin subunits in patches from simulated actin densities . We determined the number of actin subunits in a patch by integrating actin densities within a cylinder outlined in white , which elongates with the invagination ( see Figure 2 legend ) .

( Vertical dashed lines represent the axis of symmetry of model geometry . ) Volume 33 March 1 , 2022 Modeling endocytic motility in yeast | 9 geometry of the invagination along with the distributions of veloci - ties and densities of polymerized actin . Of note , solving a free boundary model of invaginations elongating in a visco - active envi - ronment is significantly more involved than the determination of shapes of static invaginations , which was carried out in Dmitrieff and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec ( 2015 ) , Zhang et al . ( 2015 ) , and Ma and Berro ( 2021 ) . Not - withstanding the challenges , formulating and solving such a model will be possible once detailed knowledge is available on the com - position and rheological properties of the endocytic membrane and its protein coat . Even with its simplifications , our model reproduced experimen - tally observed elongation rates and displacements of endocytic in - vaginations in fission and budding yeast and uncovered the connec - tion between turgor pressure and motility of endocytic invaginations in yeast . METHODS Request a protocol through Bio - protocol . The coupled system of the reaction - transport equations [ Eqs ( S1 ) , ( S1 * ) , and ( S1 * * ) ] , force - balance equation [ Eq ( S2 ) ] , and Eq ( 1 ) was solved using a moving - mesh solver of COMSOL Multiphysics , a software package for solving spatial multiphysics problems on finite element meshes ( COMSOL Multiphysics , 2015 ) . Because the invagi - nations were modeled as axially symmetric , computations were sim - plified by reducing the original three - dimensional ( 3D ) problem to an equivalent 2D model formulated in ( r , z ) coordinates . Mathemati - cal details of the model and its numerical solution are discussed in the Supplemental Material [ Eqs ( S1 ) \u2013 ( S4 ) ] . More details about the model and its numerical solution can be found in the supplemental material of ( Nickaeen et al . , 2019 ) . The supplemental COMSOL simulation file , Figure2 . mph , in - cludes all details of the model implementation with parameters yielding the results of Figure 2 . Using this file , one can reproduce other results reported in this study by running it in the COMSOL Multiphysics environment with accordingly modified parameters .

Taylor 1 , 5 The serine / threonine kinase , PINK1 , and the E3 ubiquitin ligase , Parkin , are known to facilitate LC3 - dependent autophagosomal encasement and lysoso - mal clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria , and defects in this process contribute to a variety of cardiometabolic and neurological diseases . Although recent evidence indicates that dynamic actin remodeling plays an important role in PINK1 / Parkin - mediated mitochondrial autophagy ( mitophagy ) , the underlying signaling mechanisms remain unknown . Here , we identify the RhoGAP GRAF1 ( Arhgap26 ) as a PINK1 substrate that regulates mitophagy . GRAF1 promotes the release of damaged mitochondria from F - actin anchors , regulates mitochondrial - associated Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin remodeling and facilitates Parkin - LC3 interactions to enhance mitochondria capture by autophagosomes . Graf1 phosphorylation on PINK1 - dependent sites is dysre - gulated in human heart failure , and cardiomyocyte - restricted Graf1 depletion in mice blunts mitochondrial clearance and attenuates compensatory meta - bolic adaptations to stress . Overall , we identify GRAF1 as an enzyme that coordinates cytoskeletal and metabolic remodeling to promote cardioprotection . Mitochondriaareessentialfordiversecellularprocesses . Inadditionto generating ATP for energy , they produce reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as a byproduct of their ATP - yielding electron transport activity and provide metabolites for anabolism and substrates for signaling reactions . Thus , even slight mitochondrial dysfunction can disrupt cellular redoxbalance , impaircalcium homeostasis , andreadily leadto cell death 1 , 2 . Consequently , several ef \ufb01 cient quality control mechan - isms have evolved to ensure mitochondrial homeostasis including mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion , fusion , biogenesis , and selective autophagic clearance ( i . e . mitophagy ) . Highly metabolic , long - lived cells like cardiomyocytes and neurons are particularly reliant on mitophagy as they have limited capacity for cell division - dependent dilution of damaged mitochondria or for altered mitochondrial dynamics 3 . Indeed , dysregulation of mitophagy has been linked to the develop - ment of heart failure and several neurological disorders including Parkinson \u2019 s and Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ( PD , AD ) 4 . Unfortunately , effective strategies to promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria are currently lacking .

A major mechanism involves the serine / threonine kinase PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase , Parkin . In healthy mitochon - dria , PINK1 is transported to the inner membrane ( IMM ) and is degraded by mitochondrial proteases . This translocation event is inhibited in depolarized damaged mitochondria leading to PINK1 accumulation on the outer membrane ( OMM ) 5 , 6 . PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of OMM ubiquitin ( pUb ) and mitofusin - 2 ( Mfn2 ) , a dual regulator of fusion and mitophagy leads to the recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria 4 , 7 , 8 . Subsequent phosphorylation of ParkinbyPINK1combinedwithParkin \u2019 sassociationwithpUbinducesa conformational change that enables E2 conjugating enzyme binding and full activation . Upon full activation , Parkin ubiquitinates several OMM substrates 9 that subsequently recruit ubiquitin - binding adapter proteins such as p62 , NBR1 , NDP52 , Tax1BP1 , and optineurin ( OPTN ) that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosome - associated protein , microtubule - associated protein light chain 3 ( LC3 ) , providing a critical link between the cargo to be degraded and the autophagosome 4 \u2013 13 . While certain forms of mitophagy ( such as those that involve Rab9 - mediated endosomal - mediated clearance pathways ) occur in a Parkin - independent fashion 14 , it is clear from studies performed in multiple tissues and cell types that the PINK1 - Parkin pathway renders mito - phagy more ef \ufb01 cient . Accordingly , mutations in PINK1 and Parkin contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and other rela - ted metabolic diseases in patients 15 . Parkin - dependent mitophagy has also been shown to be required for metabolic maturation of postnatal cardiomyocytes 16 , for cardioprotection provided by ischemic preconditioning 17 and for limiting cell death following myocardial infarction 18 , 19 . What is less known is how mitochondrial clearance processes are spatially controlled . During cell growth and differentiation , coordi - nated microtubule and actin dynamics position functional mitochon - drial to speci \ufb01 c intracellular locales that couple local energy production with metabolic needs . Following damage , mitochondria relocate to subcellular regions that facilitate their clearance which , in many cell types , involves retrograde traf \ufb01 cking to peri - nuclear lysosomes 20 , 21 . While recent studies indicate that actin remodeling can facilitate Parkin - dependent mitochondrial clearance 22 \u2013 27 , the underlying players that coordinate localized cytoskeletal remodeling to facilitate the traf \ufb01 cking and clearance of damaged mitochondria remain unclear . The GRAF family of RhoA GTPase activating proteins ( GAP ) are poised to co - regulate actin - and lipid - dynamics by virtue of their shared multi - domain structure 28 \u2013 32 . We previously reported that Arh - gap26 which encodes for GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with Focal adhesion kinase ) is strongly expressed in highly metabolic tis - sues ( i . e . heart , brain , andskeletalmuscle ) andisimportant forlimiting RhoA - dependent F - actin formation and for maintenance of striated muscle tissues 28 \u2013 33 . We now demonstrate that GRAF1 is rapidly recrui - ted to damaged mitochondria where , upon phosphorylation by PINK1 ( and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases ) , it facilitates mitophagosome for - mation by controlling localized actin remodeling , mitochondrial traf - \ufb01 cking , and Parkin - LC3 interactions . This pathway is conserved between various cell types , and data from patient samples and pre - clinical mouse models indicate that GRAF1 dysregulation contributes to ( and may be a viable therapeutic target for ) heart failure and per - haps other cardiometabolic or neurological diseases that result from failed mitochondrial clearance . Results GRAF1 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart We previously demonstrated that GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly exa - cerbated cardiac and skeletal muscle degeneration in the mdx model of Duchenne \u2019 s muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) 32 . Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a well - known pathological feature of DMD and stress - induced cardiomyopathies and that myo \ufb01 ber necrosis occurs because of failed clearance of damaged mitochondria in such models 34 , 35 , we explored the possibility that GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency alone might impact mitochondrial function . In support of this possibility , ultrastructural imaging of wild type ( WT ) mouse hearts revealed uniform ovoid mitochondria arranged as parallel arrays alongside myo \ufb01 brils while hearts isolated from a GRAF1 - germline de \ufb01 cient mouse line , GRAF1 gt / gt ( which harbors the gene trapping vector VICTR48 within the \ufb01 rst intron of Graf1 33 ) had a signi \ufb01 cantly higher number of mitochondria that were small , more round and more randomly dispersed ( Fig . 1a \u2013 c ; Fig . S1a \u2013 c ) suggesting compromised cardiac mitochondrial \ufb01 tness . Accordingly , siRNA - mediated depletion of GRAF1 from neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ( NRVCMs ; Fig . S1d , e ) led to mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization ( reducedred : greenratioofJC - 1staining ; Fig . 1d , e ) , and reduced respiratory capacity ( assessed by Seahorse stress test ; Fig . 1f , g ) . To con \ufb01 rm a cardiomyocyte - autonomous role for GRAF1 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis , we developed a mouse line using \u2018 knock - out - \ufb01 rst \u2019 targetingvectorsfromEucommtoconditionally target the GRAF1 allele . Southern blot analysis con \ufb01 rmed successful targeting in embryonic stem cells ( ES ) and germline transmission chimeras ( Tm1a ) , which were subsequently crossed with Flp recom - binase mice to remove a neomycin resistance cassette used for ES cell selection . We next established a cardiomyocyte - speci \ufb01 c GRAF1 knockoutmouseline ( GRAF1 CKO ) bycrossingGRAF1Tm1c ( \ufb02 oxed ) mice withthe \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer ( MCM ) line ( J AX line005657 ) whichledtoa signi \ufb01 cant reduction in cardiac GRAF1 following tamoxifen treatment . As shown in Fig . 1h \u2013 j and Table S1 , cardiac physiology was maintained in adult GRAF1 CKO mice following acute GRAF1 depletion . However , treatment with isoproterenol ( ISO ) , an \u03b1 - adrenergic agonist that increases cardiacenergy demand 36 , provoked dysfunction in GRAF1 CKO mice , indicatingthatGRAF1 de \ufb01 ciencyconferssusceptibilitytocardiac stress . Notably , dysfunction was not accounted for by changes in compensatory hypertrophy as no signi \ufb01 cant differences were observed in cardiomyocyte cross - sectional areas ( Fig . S1f , g ) . GRAF1 facilitates mitochondrial quality control Given the accumulation of small , dysfunctional mitochondria in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient hearts and the lack of adaptation of GRAF1 CKO mice to anISOchallenge , wereasonedthatGRAF1mightplayanimportantrole in regulating mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion and / or mitochondrial quality con - trol . In support of the latter , GRAF1 depletion attenuated levels of activated LC3 as assessed by turnover of autophagosome - localized , cleaved , and lipidated form ( LC3 - II ) in the presence and absence of the lysosome inhibitor , chloroquine ( Fig . S1h , i ) . Activated LC3 is a protein marker reliably associated with completed autophagosomes 37 and our \ufb01 ndings are consistent with a prior study which reported that GRAF1 promotes LC3II production and autophagosome number in Hela cells 38 . Importantly , LC3II / LC3I ratios were also signi \ufb01 cantly lower in saline and ISO treated GRAF1 CKO hearts relative to similarly treated controls ( Fig . 1k , l ) . Moreover , we quanti \ufb01 ed the presence of mitochondria - associated autophagic vacuoles in hearts from ISO - treated wild - type ( wt ) and GRAF1 CKO mice by TEM , and as shown in representative Fig . 1m , we observed signi \ufb01 cantly fewer mitophago - somes per unit area in GRAF1 CKO hearts . Additionally , we observed increased mitochondria - associated glycogen accumulation ( Fig . 1m , Fig . S1j ) , consistent with defects in autophagy and / or inef \ufb01 cient utili - zation of glycogen as a substrate . Taken together , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 facilitates cardiac autophagy under both physio - logical and high energy demand situations . LC3 - mediated , autophagosome - dependent clearance processes can be non - selective ( which generally occurs in response to energy starvation and randomly engulfs various organelles ) or selective which typicallyoccursinresponsetochangingenvironmentalconditionsand Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 2 results in the elimination of speci \ufb01 c damaged organelles . To distin - guish between these processes , we next examined levels of p62 ( also known as Sequestosome 1 , or SQSTM1 ) a substrate degraded by gen - eral autophagy . As shown in Fig . S1h , i , p62 did not accumulate in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs . Instead , GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCM exhibited higher levels of cleaved Caspase 3 , indicative of increased presence of dysfunctional mitochondria . To further explore a role for GRAF1 in mitochondrial - selective autophagy , we next used a well - characterized model that involves subjectingcellstoatreatmentwitholigomycin - Aandantimycin - A ( OA ) to induce respiratory - failure mediated mitochondrial damage . As shown in Fig . S1k , l , OA treatment led to a signi \ufb01 cant accumulation of inner mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial matrix proteins in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs , suggesting that GRAF1 is necessary for Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 WT GRAF1 KO LVID ; d LVID ; s LVID ; d LVID ; s GRAF1 CKO ISO WT ISO GRAF1 LC3B Merge V eh i c l e O A 20h O A 20h + B a f il o m yc i n ( 4h ) LC3ILC3II GAPDH GRAF1 WT CKO WT CKO Saline ISO 75 15 37 kDa - - - 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 L C 3 II / L C 3 I Saline ISO WT CKO WT CKO Tamoxifen IP ECHO ECHO ECHO ISO Infusion Sample collection Day - 7 Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 L V F S % ns ns Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 L VE F % KOWT ns ns Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 20 40 60 A T P P r odu c t i on r e l a t ed O CR ( p m o l e s / m i n ) ATP production G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 500 1000 1500 M a x i m a l R e s p i r a t i on ( p m o l e s / m i n ) Maximal Respiration G F P S i 0 500 1000 1500 S pa r e R e s p i r a t o r y C apa c i t y ( p m o l e s / m i n ) Spare Respiratory Capacity G R A F 1 S i 0 20 40 60 80 100 6 8 10 12 Time ( minutes ) O CR ( Log 2 p m o l e s / m i n ) OligomycinCCCP Rotenone & Antimycin A GFP Si GRAF1 Si h i j k l m n o HSP60 GRAF1 Merge O A 6h C oun t Aspect Ratio 250 200 150 100 50 01 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 GRAF1 gt / gt Mean WT Mean GRAF1 gt / gt WT Area ( microns 2 ) C oun t 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 50 100 0 GRAF1 gt / gt Mean WT Mean GRAF1 gt / gt WT W T G R A F 1 g t / g t f g 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 10 6 10 6 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 10 6 10 6 R ed F l uo r e sc en c e Green Fluorescence Green Fluorescence GFP Si GRAF1 Si G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 J C 1 S t a i n i ng ( r ed / g r een r a t i o ) * * a b c d e Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 3 maintaining homeostatic control of mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance . Mitofusin1 , whichisknowntobedegradedbytheubiquitin - proteosomesystemfollowingmitochondrialdamage , wasdegradedto a similar extent in control and GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cells , indicating that mitochondria were equally damaged by this treatment ( Fig . S1k ) . PGC1 \u03b1 , a transcriptional co - activator and central mediator of mito - chondrial biogenesis was signi \ufb01 cantly reduced ( not increased ) in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs ( Fig . S1m ) . Taken together , these data indi - cate that the increase in mitochondria in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cardiomyo - cytes is likely due to failed mitochondrial clearance . In strong support of a role for GRAF1 in mediating cardiomyocyte mitophagy , using a combination of confocal and structured illumination microscopy in NRVCM , weshowedthatOApromotedtherecruitmentofendogenous GRAF1 to circularized structures that co - labeled with Parkin ( Fig . S1n , o ) , the outer mitochondrial membrane marker , Tomm20 ( Fig . S1p , q ) , and LC3 ( Fig . 1n ; a phenotype particularly obvious when cells were treated with ba \ufb01 lomycin A to inhibit lysosome activity ) , and surround the mitochondrial matrix as marked by HSP60 ( Fig . 1o ) . GRAF1 promotes Parkin - mediated recruitment of autophago - somes to damaged mitochondria To explore a direct role for GRAF1 in mediating mitophagy , we next turned to a well - validated Hela / YFP - Parkin cell line in which stable expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin enables marked mito - chondrial clearance within 24 hr following OA or CCCP - induced mitochondrial dysfunction 39 . Importantly , GRAF1 depletion by siRNA treatment ( or by CRISPR - mediated knock - out ) signi \ufb01 cantly mitigated OA - induced mitochondrial turnover in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells as asses - sed either by stabilization of mitochondrial inner membrane and matrixprotein levels by Western blotting or by mitochondrialstaining , suggesting that GRAF1 plays a critical role in Parkin - mediated mito - phagy ( Fig . 2a \u2013 c , Fig . S2a \u2013 g ) . As further con \ufb01 rmation that this model involves autophagosome - dependent clearance , we showed that , like depletion of GRAF1 , depletion of the core autophagosomal elongation protein , autophagy related gene 12 ( ATG12 40 ) fully attenuated OA - mediated degradation of inner membrane and matrix proteins ( but not mitofusin 1 ) in YFP / Parkin Hela cells ( Fig . S2a , b ) . Moreover , Atg12 depletion led to a marked increase in GRAF1 levels indicating that endogenous GRAF1 may be degraded in an autophagy - dependent fashion ( Fig . S2a , b ) . Providing additional con \ufb01 rmation of GRAF1 \u2019 s role in Parkin - mediated mitophagy , while GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency suppressed mitochondrial clearance in Hela cells expressing YFP - Parkin when subjected to OA treatment , GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency did not impact the degradation of mitochondria in the parent , Parkin - de \ufb01 cient sHela cells ( Fig . S2c and d ) . This observation reinforces the notion that GRAF1 plays a crucial role in the context of Parkin - dependent mitophagy triggered by OA treatment . Moreover , while OA treatment promoted signi \ufb01 cant degradation of mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix proteins in YFP / Parkin - Hela cells , it led to a slight but signi \ufb01 cant increase in levels of P62 ( Fig . S2e ) , a protein typically targeted for degradation within autolysosomes , serving as an indicator of autop - hagic degradation activity . Notably , P62 also functions as an adapter protein for the clearance of mitochondria . This \ufb01 nding suggests that under the conditions of OA - induced mitophagy , the general autop - hagy machinery undergoes a shift from the conventional autophagy pathway to a selective clearance pathway , speci \ufb01 cally aimed at degrading damaged mitochondria . To begin to understand how GRAF1 might facilitate mitophagy , we \ufb01 rst undertook an af \ufb01 nity puri \ufb01 cation - mass spectrometry approach to identify mitophagy - dependent GRAF1 binding proteins . Surprisingly , Parkin itself was identi \ufb01 ed as a GRAF1 binding partner in OA - treated cells as assessed byLC - MS / MS ( 16 . 8 % peptide coverage ) . In support of this possibility , using confocal imaging we found that , like in cardiomyocytes , OA treatment promoted the recruitment of endo - genous GRAF1 to the Tomm20 - labeled OMM of Parkin - associated mitochondria ( Fig . 2d , Fig . S2h ) . Moreover , reciprocal co - IPs ( Fig . 2e , f ; Fig . S2i ) con \ufb01 rmed a physical association between GRAF1 and Parkin . Using a standard deletion analysis , we proceeded to map the GRAF1 interaction site on Parkin to two strings of highly conserved residues ( aa101 - 110 and aa116 - 123 ) within a linker region located between the N - terminal ubiquitin - like domain ( UBL ) and the RING - between - RING ( RBR ) super - domain that is only fully exposed upon Parkin activation ( Fig . 2f ) 41 , 42 . Notably , reduced GRAF1 association was observed with both the ubiquitination - defective Parkin variant ( C431S ) and the linker variant ( hereafter referred to as \u0394 18 ; Fig . S2j ) . Since \u0394 18 is equally modi \ufb01 ed by ubiquitination , these data indicate that it is the exposure of this activation - induced linker , not Parkin ubiquitination that is cri - tical for GRAF1 binding . To our knowledge , GRAF1 is the only protein identi \ufb01 ed to date to interact within this activation - dependent domain . In keeping with the idea that GRAF1 acts downstream of Parkin to facilitate mitophagy , we found that Parkin , GRAF1 and LC3 form a complex in cells upon Parkin activation by PINK1 ( Fig . S2k ) and that GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly reduced LC3 \u2019 s interactions with Parkin , suggesting that GRAF1 may function to target autophagosomes to damaged mitochondria ( Fig . 2g ) . To further explore this possibility , we employed a validated mitophagy reporter cell line that co - expresses mCherry - ParkinandGFP - LC3 .

However , mitochondria - autophagosome associations were signi \ufb01 cantly reduced in similarly treated GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 promotes mitophagy by driving mitophagosome production .

While some mitochondrial clustering does occur in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells after 16 hr OA treatment as assessed by ATP5B staining ( Fig . S2f ) or TEM ( Fig . S2l ) , the extent of clustering was still diminished relative to similarly treated control cells . Thus , GRAF1 \u2019 s presence makes peri - nuclear clustering more ef \ufb01 cient . Moreover , consistent with the idea that peri - nuclear mitochondrial clustering facilitates delivery of damaged mitochondria to lysosomes , the association between mitochondria and LAMP1 - labeled lysosomes was markedly reduced in OA - treated GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient Hela / Parkin cells relative to similarly treated controls ( Fig . S2m ) . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 acts downstream of Parkin to promote autophagosome capture and to facilitate traf \ufb01 cking events that enhance mitochon - drial clearance .

Subsequent cell fractionation studies revealed that the mod - i \ufb01 ed GRAF1 form localized almost exclusively to mitochondria in CCCP - treated cells ( Fig . 3a , see Fig . S3a for quanti \ufb01 cation ) . Further studies in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells revealed that an OA - dependent mobility shift was apparent at 1h and peaked by 6h following treat - ment ( Fig . 3b ) , a time course consistent with clustering of depolarized mitochondria 20 . Accordingly , this modi \ufb01 cation was induced to a much greater extent in conditions that promote Parkin dependent mito - phagy ( i . e . OA treatment ) compared to those that promote Parkin - independent macroautophagy ( i . e . serum and glucose deprivation ; Fig . S3b ) . A requirement for active Parkin was con \ufb01 rmed by comparing GRAF1 mobility in lysates from OA - treated sHela cells ( that are Parkin - de \ufb01 cient ) with the YFP - Parkin stable expressing HeLa cell line ( Fig . S3c ) . Since this mobility shift was even more apparent when a phosphate - trapping electrophoresis method was applied ( Phos - tag ) andwaslargelyreversedbytreatmentwithcalf - intestinalphosphatase , we reasoned these modi \ufb01 cations were most likely due to phosphor - ylation ( Fig . 3b ) . We initially applied a proteomic approach to identify mitophagy - dependent GRAF1 modi \ufb01 cations . Unfortunately , while we did detect several phosphorylated GRAF1 peptides , no phosphopeptides were recovered that exhibited signi \ufb01 cant PINK1 / Parkin \u2014 dependent phos - phorylation . Upon closer evaluation of the 44 % peptide coverage observed , we noticed lack of coverage of the serine / proline ( SP ) - rich region of GRAF1 . As further in silico approaches indicated lack of reasonable protease cleavage sites within this region , we proceeded with a standard deletion approach that focused on this area . As shown in Fig . 3c and d , deletion of amino acids 658 - 703 nearly completely mitigated OA - dependent GRAF1 phosphorylation in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells . We next individuallymutated the 20 serine or threonine residues in this domain to a phosphor - de \ufb01 cient alanine and explored the mobility of these variants in un - treated ( Fig . S3d ) and OA - treated conditions ( Fig . 3e ) . Using this deconstructive approach , we identi \ufb01 ed three major sites of phosphorylation , S668 , T670 and S671 each of which were evolutionarily invariant in GRAF1 ( Fig . 3e , f ) . These amino acids were also conserved in other GRAF family members ( albeit in different combinations ) indicating the likely importance of this reg - ulatory region . For example , T670 and S671 are conserved in human GRAF2 , S668andS671inhumanGRAF3andT670wasconservedinthe related human protein Oligophrenin . We next developed a speci \ufb01 c antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of GRAF1 on S668 , T670 , and / or S671 and con \ufb01 rmed that OA treatment induced GRAF1 phos - phorylaiton of these sites ( Fig . S3e ) . We also used this tool to con \ufb01 rm that phosphorylated GRAF1selectivelyaccumulatesondamagedmitochondria . Tothisend , we developed a sophisticated APEX2 - based enzyme - catalyzed proxi - mity biotinylation system 43 . This method involves the fusion of a peroxidase enzyme to a bait protein ( in this case an OMM targeting domain ) that ef \ufb01 ciently biotinylates proteins within a 10 nm radius following addition of biotin - phenol ( BP ) and hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) . Biotinylated proteins can then be puri \ufb01 ed ( and quanti \ufb01 ed ) following precipitation with streptavidin - labeled beads . As shown in Fig . S3f , immunoblotsofstreptavidinprecipitatesfromvehicle - treated APEX2 - OMM / Hela - Parkin cells stimulated with H 2 0 2 and BP for 30s , revealed a small but detectible level of GRAF1 . But , consistent with our cell fractionation studies , signi \ufb01 cantly more GRAF1 was apparent in streptavidin precipitates from APEX2 - OMM / Hela - Parkin cells treated with OA for 2 hr prior to 30 s stimulation with H 2 0 2 and BP . Moreover , immunoblotting with GRAF1 p668 / 670 / 671 Ab and Parkin revealed mitochondrial - exclusive biotinylation of phosphorylated GRAF1 and active ( polyubiqutinated ) Parkin in OA / H 2 0 2 / BP - treated cells . These data con \ufb01 rm that phosphorylated GRAF1 accumulates on mitochon - dria in a depolarization - dependent fashion . Given the accumulation of phosphorylated GRAF1 on damaged mitochondria , we next explored the exciting possibility that GRAF1 might be one of a select few bona \ufb01 de PINK1 substrates . In support of this likelihood , siRNA - mediated depletion of PINK1 reduced OA - stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous GRAF1 in Hela / YFP - Par - kinasassessedbybothachangeinmobilityonSDS - PAGEandPhos - tag gelsandbyintensityofdetectionwithourphosphorylation - speci \ufb01 cAb ( Fig . 3g ) . Importantly , the capacity of active PINK1 to directly phos - phorylate full length GRAF1 was con \ufb01 rmed using in vitro kinase assays with puri \ufb01 ed PINK1 and GRAF1 fusion proteins ( Fig . 3h ) . Notably , mutation of either S668 or S671 to alanine signi \ufb01 cantlyreduced PINK1 - mediated phosphorylation of GRAF1 . Collectively , these studies pro - vide strong support for GRAF1 as a substrate for PINK1 itself and / or additional PINK1 / Parkin - dependent kinases . PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 promotes mito - chondrial WAVE2 complex formation and mitochondrial clustering As noted above , one of the \ufb01 rst defects observed in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells was a lack of perinuclear clustering following mitochondrial depolarization . Of major importance , WT GRAF1 , but not a 668 / 670 / 671 triple alanine GRAF1 variant ( hereafter referred to as GRAF1 AAA ) , restored OA - induced perinuclear mitochondrial clustering and degradation in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient Hela / YFP - Parkin cells . This \ufb01 nding indicated an important functional consequence of PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation ( Fig . 3i \u2013 k ) . We next used LC - MS / MS to identify pro - teins that differentially IP \u2019 d with WT GRAF1 versus GRAF1 AAA in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells following OA treatment ( ProteomeXchange ID PXD043212 ) . Given the impact of GRAF1 phosphorylation on mito - chondrialclustering , wefocused further efforts on proteins that might be expected to impact mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking . One such protein , Abelson - interactor adaptor - 2 ( ABI2 ) was signi \ufb01 cantly enriched in WT versus GRAF1 AAA IPs . This was intriguing because ABI2 is known to play a role in the positioning and activation of the Wiskott \u2013 Aldrich syn - drome protein family member , WAVE2 a major regulator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation that was previously implicated in Fig . 2 | GRAF1 promotes Parkin - dependent mitophagy in Hela cells by facil - itating autophagosome capture . a , b siRNA transfected Hela / YFP - Parkin cells weretreatedwithOAforindicatedtimesandlevelsofmitochondrialproteinswere detected and quanti \ufb01 ed by Western blot / densitometry ( b ) n = 3 independent experiments . c Quanti \ufb01 cation of mitochondria in Hela / YFP - Parkin cellsasassessed by ATP5B staining ( n = 50 cells from 3 independent experiments ; see Fig .

Con \ufb01 rmatory studies revealed that ABI2 co - IPd with GRAF1 in an OA - dependent fashion and revealed that this interaction was dependent on GRAF1 phosphorylation ( note reduced binding of the AAA variant ; Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , in strong support of a functional consequence of this interaction , GRAF1 depletion markedly reduced ABI2 : WAVE2 complex formation ( Fig . 4b see Fig . S3g for quanti \ufb01 cation ) . Using GST - fusion precipitation , we further con \ufb01 rmed a direct association between ABI2 and GRAF1 and mapped the interaction site to the GRAF1 SH3 domain ( Fig . S3h ) . While ABI2 strongly interacted with the isolated SH3 domain , it failed to interact with a construct that also contained the upstream serine / proline ( SP ) rich domain that harbors PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation sites ( Fig .

In strong support of this idea , mutation of S668 / T670 / S671 to phosphorylation mimetic DDD or EEE variants rendered the GRAF1 SP - SH3 fusion protein capable of ABI2 binding ( Fig . 4c ) . Moreover , co - IP experiments revealed that the full length phosphomimetic variant ( GRAF1DDD ) strongly interacted with ABI2 even in the absence of OA treatment ( Fig . 4d ) , further con \ufb01 rming the function of PINK1 - dependent phosphorylations . GRAF1 facilitates actin remodeling to promote PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy There is a growing realization of the importance of actin cytoskeletal remodeling in macro - and selective autophagy 21 , 44 . Generally , RhoA dependent F - actin cables limit mitophagy , while Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin polymers facilitate the process by promoting autop - hagosome formation and lysosomal transport . However , it is not cur - rently clear how these processes are controlled in a spatial and temporal fashion following mitochondrial depolarization . Given that GRAF1 limits RhoA - dependent F - actin formation 28 \u2013 33 , and is dynami - callyrecruitedtodepolarizedmitochondriawhereitassociateswithan Arp2 / 3 regulator in a PINK1 / Parkin - dependent fashion , we postulated that GRAF1 might function to interconnect actin remodeling with mitochondrial depolarization to facilitate mitophagy . In strong sup - port of this possibility , GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly reduced OA - dependent recruitment of the WAVE2 complex ( WAVE2 , ABI2 and CYFIP1 ) to mitochondria as assessed by subcellular fractionation ( Fig . 4e , f ) . We next used super resolution microscopy ( SR - SIM ) and confocal imaging to monitor mitochondrial - associated actin following OA treatment . In control cells , OA treatment led to the dissolution of linear F - actin \ufb01 laments and the formation of small actin bundles and this remodeling was temporally associated with mitochondrial clus - tering . In contrast , OA - mediated F - actin dissolution was attenuated in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells and mitochondria failed to cluster and remained associated with peripheral linear actin bundles ( Fig . 4g , h , Fig . S3i , see Fig . S3jforquanti \ufb01 cation ) . Treatment withtheArp2 / 3inhibitor , CK666 partially phenocopied the impairment of F - actin remodeling and mitochondrial clustering ( Fig . S3k ) , and the impairment of mitochon - drial clearance ( as assessed by HSP60 levels ; Fig . S3l , m ) observed in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells . Treatment with the F - actin polymerization drug , latrunculin B ( LatB ) , which limits stress \ufb01 ber formation , signi \ufb01 cantly ( although not completely ) rescued mitochondrial clustering defects in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cells ( Fig . 4i and j , Fig . S3n ) . Collectively , these data support a model in which following mitochondrial depolarization , GRAF1 facilitates localized F - actin depolymerization which both releases mitochondria from F - actin cablesandgeneratesG - actinmonomersfornascent polymerization . In turn , GRAF1 phosphorylation is induced in a PINK1 - Parkin dependent fashion on damaged mitochondria which leads to ABI2 recruitment , WAVE2 complex formation and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin formation that is necessary for mitochondrial clearance . Thus , GRAF1 is distinctive from other mitophagy receptors because it facilitates mitophagy by serving not only as a Parkin to autophagosome scaffold , but also as an enzyme that promotes local mitochondria \u2010 associated actin remodeling ( see Fig . 4k ) . GRAF1 CKO hearts exhibit impaired metabolic \ufb02 exibility following isoproterenol challenge Given that cardiomyocytes exhibit a unique cytoskeletal and mito - chondrial organization , we sought to con \ufb01 rm that GRAF1 also pro - motes mitochondrial clearance in a PINK1 / Parkin / LC3 and actin remodeling - dependent fashion in these cells . In support of this pos - sibility , OA treatment induced rapid PINK1 - dependent phosphoryla - tion of GRAF1 on 668 / 670 / 671 in isolated cardiomyocytes ( Fig . 5a \u2013 d ) . Furthermore , OA treatment promoted the recruitment of endogenous GRAF1 to mitochondria that were associated with branched actin \ufb01 la - ments ( Fig . 5e ) . Importantly , OA \u2014 induced actin remodeling and mitochondrial circularization and clustering were all signi \ufb01 cantly reduced in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cardiomyocytes ( Fig . 5f , g ) . Mounting evidence in the \ufb01 eld indicates that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are intrinsically linked ( i . e . mitophagy pro - motesmitochondriabiogenesisviaPINK / Parkin - mediateddegradation of apowerful PGC - 1 \u03b1 transcriptional repressor , PARIS ) 45 . Thus , wenext sought to test the extent to which GRAF1 was necessary for a mitophagy - dependenthomeostaticcircuitinintacthearts . Tothisend , we subjected WTand GRAF1 gt / gt mice to hyperoxia - a stress that loosely mimics the changes in oxygen exposure that occurs at birth and has been shown to promote mitophagy - dependent mitochondrial biogenesis 46 . As shown in Fig . 5h , hyperoxia induced mitochondrial biogenesis in WT hearts as assessed by increased expression of PGC1 \u03b1 target genes that regulate mitochondrial transcription ( PPAR \u03b3 ) , the TCA cycle ( citrate synthase ) , and OXPHOS ( COXIV ) . In contrast , hyperoxia treatment did not signi \ufb01 cantly alter expression of these genes in GRAF1 gt / gt hearts . These data further substantiate a role for GRAF1 inpromoting mitochondrialquality control in the myocardium . Consistent with prior studies that ISO treatment also induces car - diac mitophagy 36 , acute treatment of mice with ISO also led to pro - nounced phosphorylation of GRAF1 ( Fig . 5i , j ) . To further con \ufb01 rm that GRAF1 plays a crucial role in adult cardiomyocyte mitophagy , we per - formed additional experiments using the powerful mt - Keima mouse model . Mt - Keima is a pH sensitive \ufb02 orescent protein that is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the N - terminal targeting signal of COX8A and has been validated as a rigorous and reproducible reporter to track PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy in vivo 47 . Using this model system , we show that hearts from ISO - treated mt - Keima / GRAF1 CKO mice have signi \ufb01 cantly lower levels of mitophagy than hearts from similarly trea - ted mt - Keima / GRAF1 + / + mice ( Fig . 5k , l ) . Thus , when taken together with evidence that mitophagy - dependent mitochondrial biogenesis Fig . 3 | PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 promotes retrograde mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking and clustering . a siRNA transfected Hela / YFP - Parkin cells were treated with CCCP or vehicle .

S3o ) . These \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 CKO hearts exhibited impaired ability to ef \ufb01 ciently utilize carbohydrate as an alternative substrate for energy production , a \ufb01 nding consistent with our ultra - structural data that revealed notable accumulation of glycogen around mitochondria in GRAF1 CKO hearts ( see Fig . 1m ) . In support of these \ufb01 ndings , similar ( albeit more modest ) differences were observed in serum metabolites isolated from the ISO - treated mice ( e . g . ISO - treated WT mouse serum exhibited signi \ufb01 cantly higher levels of metabolites derived from fructose / mannose metabolism , the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis / gluconeogenesis ) , whereas none of these metabolites were signi \ufb01 cantly different between saline - treated WT and GRAF1 CKO mice . Indeed , only 5 of the 224 metabolites detected in serum samples differed between saline treated animals , consistent with the notion that GRAF1 - dependent processes are employed under condi - tionsofhighenergydemand . Thehighlevelsofglycolyticintermediates observed in serum from WT animals is consistent with prior studies showing that cardiac stress promotes a change in fuel utilization in the myocardium from predominantly fatty acid consumption to glycolysis 49 . Instead , GRAF1 CKO hearts had altered amino acid metabo - lism and produced lower levels of ATP , indicating a lack of metabolic \ufb02 exibility \u2014 a process recently linked to mitochondrial quality control mechanisms including mitophagy 50 . Finally , in strong support of a critical role for GRAF1 - dependent mitophagy in the pathological progression of human disease , we found that GRAF1 phosphorylation at PINK1 / Parkin - dependent sites was dysregulated in cardiac samples from patients diagnosed with either hypertrophicor dilated cardiomyopathy ( HCM or DCM ) relative to age and sex matched controls ( Fig . 5o , Fig . S3p , see Table S2 for individualized patient data ) . When taken together with the signi \ufb01 cant reduction in mitochondrial content ( as assessed by Hsp60 levels ) and total GRAF1 protein , these \ufb01 ndings are in keeping with disruptions in mitochondrial homeostasis in HF . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that dysregulation of GRAF1 expression or activity may exacerbate heart failure and possibly other disorders that result from defects in PINK1 / Parkin - mediated mitochondrial quality control . Discussion Recent \ufb01 ndings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the overriding pathophysiological hallmarks of numerous cardiometa - bolic , skeletal - , and neuro - degenerative diseases 15 , 35 , 51 , 52 . Unfortunately , effective strategies to promote the clearance of damaged mitochon - dria are currently lacking . This is due , at least in part , to the fact that severalproteins involved in this processhave redundant functions and relatively few of the essential proteins identi \ufb01 ed to date have targe - table enzymatic moieties . Herein , we identi \ufb01 ed GRAF1 as a mitophagy regulator that plays a fundamental role in facilitating PINK1 / Parkin - dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria . Our data support a model in which mitochon - drial membrane depolarization triggers partial GRAF1 translocation to theOMMofdamagedmitochondriawhereitisphosphorylatedbyPINK1 and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases . Phosphorylated GRAF1 then forms a physical interaction with active Parkin and promotes capture and encasement of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes . Our tem - poral approaches suggest that GRAF1 does not impact the initial recruitment of Parkin or the autophagy receptor OPTN 20 , 52 , but acts downstream as an enzyme that promotes localized actin remodeling to facilitatemitochondrialtraf \ufb01 cking and clearance . Thefutureapplication of high powered , real time imaging to track the fates of individual mitochondria and localized actin \ufb01 bers during mitochondrial clearance will be necessary to provide further support for this conclusion and to shed light on additional unanswered questions in the \ufb01 eld regarding the precise mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal clearance of damaged mitochondria in various cell types . Actin dynamics and mitochondrial homeostasis Actin has been long known to regulate mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion , fusion and traf \ufb01 cking , and more recent studies indicate that actin plays a wider role in mitochondrial clearance 21 , 22 , 44 . Cytoplasmic actin exists as monomeric units ( G - actin ) or in polymerized states that can be bran - ched or linear ( F - actin ) . F - actin \ufb01 laments are formed by RhoA \u2014 dependent activation of mDia and the formin family of actin binding proteins while branched actin is formed by Rac1 - dependent processes and the coordinated activity of the Actin - related protein 2 / Actin - rela - ted protein 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex and various nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , including WAVEs , WASP , WASH , and others . Recent studies have shown that during general autophagy , local assembly of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin \ufb01 laments is necessary to support formation of nascent autophagosomes and for the expansion , trans - port , and fusion of the autophagsomes with lysosomes 23 \u2013 25 , 53 . During mitophagy , Arp2 / 3 - and myosin ( MyoV1 ) - mediated actin remodeling has been further implicated in forming protective shells around dysfunctional mitochondria and in dispersing clumps of damaged mitochondria to facilitate subsequent autophagosome cap - ture and clearance 26 , 53 . The prevailing model is that rapid formation of protective shells or cages can shield the cell from dangerous mito - chondrial byproducts ( i . e . ROS ) and / or contents ( i . e . cytochrome C , mitochondrial DNA ) that are released by dysfunctional mitochondria and , at the same time , prevent re - fusion of the damaged mitochondria with their healthy neighbors until autophagosomes can be generated andrecruitedtocleartheseorganelles . However , anumberofimportant questions remain with respect to the formation of these structures such as : What is the mechanism by which Arp2 / 3 is activated following mitochondrial depolarization ? Which NPFs are involved in mitochondrial - localized Arp2 / 3 activation ? How are the actin shells removed or dissambled to allow encapsulation by the autophagosome ?

Mitochondrial poisoning promotes rapid F - actin depolymerization , and the impor - tance of this event is underscored by recent studies indicating that F - actin impedes mitophagy and exacerbates Parkinson \u2019 s - like pheno - types in animal models . Indeed , Moskal et . al . identi \ufb01 ed Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitors in a discovery - based screen for small molecule activators of mitophagy and further showed that ROCK inhibitors provided protection from paraquat - mediated neurodegeneration in \ufb02 ies . Likewise , Sarcar et . al . showed that neurodegeneration in trans - genic \u03b1 - synuclein expressing \ufb02 ies was associated with excess F - actin stabilization , and the degenerative phenotype was attenuated by co - expression of the actin severing protein , gelsolin 54 .

Firstly , consistent with prior studies from our lab and others demonstrating that GRAF1 is necessary for limiting RhoA mediated F - actin formation 29 , weshowthatGRAF1aidsinpromotingmitochondrialpoison - inducedF - actin de - polymerization which both releases mitochondria from F - actin cables to facilitate mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking and generates G - actin monomers for nascent polymerization . In turn , GRAF1 is recruited to theOMMofdamagedmitochondria , isphosphorylatedbyPINK1and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases , which facilitates WAVE2 complex formation and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin formation that is necessary for mitochondrialclearance . Thismodelissupportedbythesimilarkinetics ofPINK1 - dependentphosphorylationandtheexclusiveaccumulationof fully phosphorylated GRAF1 on mitochondria . We provide strong evi - dence that PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 relieves auto - inhibition between the GRAF1 serine - proline rich and SH3 domains to facilitate ABI2 / WAVE2 / Arp2 / 3 recruitment and mitochondrial cluster - ing . Our \ufb01 ndings that WT GRAF1 but not the triple phosphor - de \ufb01 cient GRAF1 variant can rescue mitochondrial clustering in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cellslendsstrongsupporttothismodel . However , itisformallypossible that other GRAF1 SH3 binding partners and / or RhoA - dependent mechanisms are involved . Because GRAF1 also facilitates autophago - some recruitment , we posit that GRAF1 has the capacity to \ufb01 ne - tune actin polymerization / depolymerization in a spatial and temporal fash - ion to ensure the quick and ef \ufb01 cient capture and clearance of damaged mitochondria . RecentstudiesinAtg7knockoutmicerevealeddefectsin both autophagosome formation and actin assembly 21 , further sup - porting an actin - mitophagy interconnection . While our studies in Hela cells support a role for GRAF1 in pro - moting retrograde traf \ufb01 cking of damaged mitochondria , very recent studies suggest that some cells including neurons , brown adipocytes , and cardiomyocytes can also eliminate damaged mitochondria into the extracellular space by autophagy - dependent anterograde traf - \ufb01 cking to the plasma membrane 21 , 55 \u2013 57 . While these events likely also require coordinated membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling events , future studies are necessary to determine the relative impact of this clearance mechanism in the heart and the extent to which GRAF1 might be involved . Likewise , while our data strongly support the contention that GRAF1 selectively promotes PINK1 - Parkin dependent mitophagy in settings in which mitochondrial membrane depolariza - tion or dysfunction is induced , it is formally possible that GRAF1 plays additional roles in general macroautophagy in conditions that favor this response , as suggested by a prior report 38 . GRAF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria Under basal conditions in healthy muscle cells , GRAF1 physically interacts with FAK in actin - associated adhesion complexes 28 and we now show for the \ufb01 rst time that upon mitochondrial damage , GRAF1 redistributes to the OMM of Parkin and LC3 - labeled mitochondria . While further studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms by which GRAF1 is recruited to damaged mitochondria , we propose a model in which the GRAF1 BAR - PH domain may mediate binding to depolarization - exposed phospholipids on the outer mito - chondrial membrane . Notably , a PH domain ligand , cardiolipin ( CL ) is rapidly transferred to the outer lea \ufb02 et of the OMM by phospholipid scramblase 3 , and its externalization is known to promote mitophagy through mechanisms that involve direct interactions with LC3 11 . Moreover , depolarization - mediated accumulation of additional phos - pholipids such as phosphatidyl serine , phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidic acid induce curvature of damaged mitochondrial membranes 11 , which could drive BAR domain - mediated interactions . The lipid - bending BAR domainof GRAF1 may serve to further facilitate inward membrane curvature - dependent mitochondrial encasement of LC3B - containing autophagosomes 58 , 59 . Future studies are warranted to determinetheextenttowhichthesemodi \ufb01 cationsmightcontributeto GRAF1 recruitment to and / or retention on damaged mitochondria . In vivo consequences and putative clinical relevance of GRAF1 - dependent mitophagy We provide strong evidence that GRAF1 is necessary for mediating PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart fol - lowing an adrenergic challenge and that GRAF1 is dysregulated in human heart failure . These data are in keeping with our prior studies showing that co - depletion of GRAF1 and dystrophin 32 unmasked car - diac and skeletal muscle phenotypes that were associated with meta - bolic dysfunction . Under each of these conditions , GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient hearts exhibited widespread \ufb01 brosis , focal necrosis , in \ufb02 ammation , signi \ufb01 cantlydecreasedejectionfractionandfractionalshortening , and ultrastructural mitochondrial defects 31 , 32 . Consistently , overall meta - bolic pro \ufb01 les from hearts and serum from ISO - treated GRAF1 CKO mice are suggestive of impaired mitophagy - dependent transition to glyco - lysis and compensatory increase in amino acid metabolism . In this regard it is interesting to note that the phenotype of cardiac GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient mice mirrored cardiac ATG5 - de \ufb01 cient mice in that there was no signi \ufb01 cant difference in cardiac function until mice were challenged 36 . Taken together , these studies suggests that autophagy / mitophagy is not essential for basal cardiac function , but is necessary for situations in which there is a mismatch in energy supply and demand . This \ufb01 nding is in keeping with recent studies indicating that mitochondrial \ufb02 exibility is necessary to maintain energy stability and muscle function in conditions with high demand to fuel ratios 60 . Thereare a few notable limitations of our in vivo studies . Firstly , it is formally possible that additional RhoA - dependent effects could contribute to cardiac dysfunction in our model . However , it is Fig . 5 | GRAF1 is required for stress - induced metabolic adaptation in adult hearts and is dysregulated in human heart disease . a , b Endogenous GRAF1 phosphorylation in NRVCMs treated with OA and examined by Phos - tag gel and Western using GRAF1 phos - S668 / T670 / S671 Ab , and densitometric quanti \ufb01 cation ( b ) n = 3 independent experiments . c , d siRNA transfected NRVCMs were treated withOAandGRAF1phosphorylationwasexaminedusingpS668 / T670 / S671GRAF1 Ab .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 12 important to note that depletion of GRAF1 leads to a modest and transient activation of RhoA 31 \u2013 33 and studies from others indicate that moderate ( ~ 2 - 5fold ) overexpressionofconstitutivelyactiveRhoAdoes not negatively impact cardiac function and may even be cardiopro - tective under stressed conditions 61 . Secondly , we did not include female mice in this study . Based on our prior published studies that revealed no statistical differences in cardiac function in male and female GRAF1 gt / gt mice 32 , and studies from others showing lack of sexual dimorphism in isoproterenol - induced cardiac outcomes including heart rate , hypertrophy , dysfunction , and \ufb01 brosis , we would not expect a difference between males and female mice in this parti - cular stress model 62 , however , future studies will be necessary to con \ufb01 rm this thesis . Based on our data showing that GRAF1 plays a unique role in promoting PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy , we surmise that it could regulate the pathological progression of additional cardiome - tabolic and / or neurological diseases associated with dysfunctions in mitochondrial clearance . It will be of future interest to determine if , likeParkin , GRAF1isalsonecessaryforthemetabolicmaturationthatis known to occur during early postnatal cardiac development 16 and for limiting ischemic stress - mediated injury in the adult myocardium 17 \u2013 19 . With respect to neurodegenerative disease , it is notable that nearly all PD - associated mutations impact proteins that participate in mito - chondrial quality control 52 , 63 , and GRAF1 was shown by others to be neuroprotective in a human Parkinson \u2019 s cell culture model ( MPP + \u2010 treated dopaminergic neuroblastoma SK \u2010 N \u2010 SH cells ) 64 . While related patient data are relatively scarce , 24 patients to date have been reported with GRAF1 autoimmunity , and of these cases , 83 % of patients had cerebellar ataxia ( a feature common in PD and related diseases ) , approximately 30 % exhibited cerebellar atrophy and 1 patient had been diagnosed with early stage PD 65 . Thus , our studies provide a strong rationale for a more extensive exploration of the association between Arhgap26 polymorphisms and susceptibility to heart failure , PD , and perhaps other diseases that involve metabolic dysfunction 66 .

Metabolite extraction , pro \ufb01 ling and metabolomic data analysis . Metabolite extraction was performed as described in a previous study 74 . Following \ufb02 ash freezing ~ 30mg tissue sections were homo - genized into powder in liquid nitrogen by mortar & pestle . 3 ~ 10mg tissue powder was thoroughly mixed with 200 \u03bc l ice cold 80 % methanol ( HPLC grade ) . An additional 300 \u03bc L ice cold 80 % methanol was added in each tube and vortexed rigorously for 1min . After incu - bation onicefor 10 min , the tissue extractwas centrifuged at20 , 000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15min . The supernatant , normalized to sample weight , was transferred and aliquoted into two clean Eppendorf tubes . Next , the tubes were speed vacuum dried at room temperature . The dry pellets were stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for liquid chromatography with high - resolution mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) analysis . Ultimate 3000 UHPLC ( Dionex ) coupled to Q Exactive Plus - Mass spectrometer ( QE - MS , Thermo Scienti \ufb01 c ) was used for metabolite pro \ufb01 ling . The dry pellets were reconstituted into 30 \u03bc L sample solvent ( water : methanol : acetonitrile , 2 : 1 : 1 , v / v ) and 3 \u03bc l was further analyzed by LC - MS . A hydrophilic interaction chromatography method ( HILIC ) employing an Xbridge amide column ( 100 \u00d72 . 1mm i . d . , 3 . 5 \u03bc m ; Waters ) was used for polar metabolite separation . Detailed LC method was described previously 75 except that mobile phase A was replaced with water containing 5mM ammonium acetate ( pH6 . 8 ) . The QE - MS was equipped with a HESI probe with related parameters set as below : heater temperature , 120\u00b0C ; sheath gas , 30 ; auxiliary gas , 10 ; sweep gas , 3 ; spray voltage , 3 . 0 kV for the positive mode and 2 . 5 kV for the negative mode ; capillary temperature , 320\u00b0C ; S - lens , 55 ; A scan range ( m / z ) of 70 to 900 wasused inpositive mode from 1 . 31 to 12 . 5min . For negativemode , ascanrangeof70to900wasusedfrom1 . 31to6 . 6min and then 100 to 1000 from 6 . 61 to 12 . 5min ; resolution : 70000 ; auto - mated gain control ( AGC ) , 3 \u00d710 6 ions . Customized mass calibration was performed before data acquisition . LC - MS peak extraction and integration were performed using commercially available software Sieve 2 . 2 ( Thermo Scienti \ufb01 c ) . The integrated peak area was used to represent the relative abundance of each metabolite in different Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 17 samples . To avoid in \ufb01 nite values when calculate fold changes , a value 1000 was used for metabolites not detected in some samples but that have measurable signals in one or more other samples . The annotated metabolites from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) Compound database ( www . genome . jp / kegg ) and Human Metabolome Database ( HMDB ) were used for analysis . The data matrix of metabo - lites extracted from mouse hearts was normalized by sum and then wasauto - scaled ( mean - centeredanddividedbythestandarddeviation of each variable ) . The data matrix of metabolites extracted from mouse serum was normalized by median and then was auto - scaled ( mean - centered and divided by the standard deviation of each vari - able ) . Metabolite pathway analysis , hierarchical clustering and heat - map and statistical analysis was conducted using Metaboanalyst 5 . 0 ( http : / / www . metaboanalyst . ca / MetaboAnalyst / ) . Adrenergic challenge and transthoracic echocardiography . \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer / + and \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer / + : GRAF1 \ufb02 ox / \ufb02 ox male mice ( 2 \u2013 3 - month - old ) received a single intraperitoneal injection ( IP ) injection of 40mg / kg tamoxifen ( Sigma ) dissolved in sterile peanut oil . For the chronic \u03b2 - adrenergic stimulation model , mice were treated at 7 days post tamoxifen injection with Isoproterenol ( ISO ) ( Sigma ) at a dosage of 15mg / kg / day for 14days using subcutaneously implanted Osmotic pumps ( model 2002 , Alzet ) . Cardiac physiology was evaluated by echocardiography prior to ISO infusion as well as at 7days and 14 days post ISO infusion . Transthoracic echocardiography ( ECHO ) was per - formed using a VisualSonics Vevo 2100 system equipped with MS400 transducer ( Visual Sonics ) . 2 - D guided M - mode images of the left ventriclewereobtainedfromlongaxisviewatthemid - ventricularlevel of the papillary muscles in conscious , gently restrained mice . ECHO measurements from 5 - 6 consecutive cycles were averaged using Visual Sonics software ( VevoLAB , Version - 5 . 5 . 0 ) . For acute \u03b2 - adrenergic sti - mulation model , mice were treated at 7 days post tamoxifen injection with a single subcutaneous injection of ISO ( 200mg / kg / day ) for 3 consecutive days . Heart tissues were collected 4 \u2013 6 h post the last ISO injection . To measure cardiac mitophagy , we employed confocal microscopy , following a previously described methodology 76 . GRAF1 phosphorylation in human myocardial tissue . Human myo - cardial tissue samples from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) and non - failing ( NF ) control 33 \u2013 57 - year - old male patients ( 6 samples per group ) were used in this study . Thesesamples were procured from the Duke HumanHeartRepository ( DHHR ) which isa Duke University Hospital InstitutionalReview Board approved tissue repository ( IRB No . Pro00005621 ) . Samples were obtained using informed consent or a waiver of consent for discarded tissues . Left ventricular ( LV ) cardiac tissue from HCM and DCM patients were obtained at the time of cardiac transplantation . LV car - diac tissue from NF subjects were obtained from deceased donors whose hearts were not used for transplantation . At the time of col - lection , the LV tissue was sharply dissected then \ufb02 ash frozen in a cryovial using liquid nitrogen . The tissue was stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until it was utilized . Patient data at the time of tissue procurement was ret - rospectively collected by DHHR personnel from an electronic medical record database or from organ donor records and de - identi \ufb01 ed information is presented in the Supplementary Information ( Table S2 ) . Heart tissue was homogenized in Triton X - 100 lysis buffer . GRAF1 phosphorylation in the lysate was analyzed by Western blotting as described above . Statistical calculations . Differences were analyzed by two - tailed unpaired Student \u2019 s t - test for experiments with two groups and one - way or two - way ANOVA with post - hoc Tukey \u2019 s or Sidak test for multi - ple comparisons for experiments \u2265 3 groups . A value of P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi \ufb01 cant . No statistical analysis was used to predetermine sample sizes . Data are represented as mean\u00b1 SD or mean\u00b1SEM from at least three independent experiments or at least three biological samples . In all cases similar results were found from experiment to experiment and all technically sound experiments were used in data analysis . All statistical data were calculated and graphed using GraphPad Prism 10 . 0 .

Gross 6 , Michelle Mendiola Pla 6 , Christopher P . Mack 1 , 5 & Joan M . Taylor 1 , 5 The serine / threonine kinase , PINK1 , and the E3 ubiquitin ligase , Parkin , are known to facilitate LC3 - dependent autophagosomal encasement and lysoso - mal clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria , and defects in this process contribute to a variety of cardiometabolic and neurological diseases . Although recent evidence indicates that dynamic actin remodeling plays an important role in PINK1 / Parkin - mediated mitochondrial autophagy ( mitophagy ) , the underlying signaling mechanisms remain unknown . Here , we identify the RhoGAP GRAF1 ( Arhgap26 ) as a PINK1 substrate that regulates mitophagy . GRAF1 promotes the release of damaged mitochondria from F - actin anchors , regulates mitochondrial - associated Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin remodeling and facilitates Parkin - LC3 interactions to enhance mitochondria capture by autophagosomes . Graf1 phosphorylation on PINK1 - dependent sites is dysre - gulated in human heart failure , and cardiomyocyte - restricted Graf1 depletion in mice blunts mitochondrial clearance and attenuates compensatory meta - bolic adaptations to stress . Overall , we identify GRAF1 as an enzyme that coordinates cytoskeletal and metabolic remodeling to promote cardioprotection . Mitochondriaareessentialfordiversecellularprocesses . Inadditionto generating ATP for energy , they produce reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as a byproduct of their ATP - yielding electron transport activity and provide metabolites for anabolism and substrates for signaling reactions . Thus , even slight mitochondrial dysfunction can disrupt cellular redoxbalance , impaircalcium homeostasis , andreadily leadto cell death 1 , 2 . Consequently , several ef \ufb01 cient quality control mechan - isms have evolved to ensure mitochondrial homeostasis including mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion , fusion , biogenesis , and selective autophagic clearance ( i . e . mitophagy ) . Highly metabolic , long - lived cells like cardiomyocytes and neurons are particularly reliant on mitophagy as they have limited capacity for cell division - dependent dilution of damaged mitochondria or for altered mitochondrial dynamics 3 . Indeed , dysregulation of mitophagy has been linked to the develop - ment of heart failure and several neurological disorders including Parkinson \u2019 s and Alzheimer \u2019 s disease ( PD , AD ) 4 . Unfortunately , effective strategies to promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria are currently lacking .

A major mechanism involves the serine / threonine kinase PINK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase , Parkin . In healthy mitochon - dria , PINK1 is transported to the inner membrane ( IMM ) and is degraded by mitochondrial proteases . This translocation event is inhibited in depolarized damaged mitochondria leading to PINK1 accumulation on the outer membrane ( OMM ) 5 , 6 . PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of OMM ubiquitin ( pUb ) and mitofusin - 2 ( Mfn2 ) , a dual regulator of fusion and mitophagy leads to the recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria 4 , 7 , 8 . Subsequent phosphorylation of ParkinbyPINK1combinedwithParkin \u2019 sassociationwithpUbinducesa conformational change that enables E2 conjugating enzyme binding and full activation . Upon full activation , Parkin ubiquitinates several OMM substrates 9 that subsequently recruit ubiquitin - binding adapter proteins such as p62 , NBR1 , NDP52 , Tax1BP1 , and optineurin ( OPTN ) that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosome - associated protein , microtubule - associated protein light chain 3 ( LC3 ) , providing a critical link between the cargo to be degraded and the autophagosome 4 \u2013 13 . While certain forms of mitophagy ( such as those that involve Rab9 - mediated endosomal - mediated clearance pathways ) occur in a Parkin - independent fashion 14 , it is clear from studies performed in multiple tissues and cell types that the PINK1 - Parkin pathway renders mito - phagy more ef \ufb01 cient . Accordingly , mutations in PINK1 and Parkin contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and other rela - ted metabolic diseases in patients 15 . Parkin - dependent mitophagy has also been shown to be required for metabolic maturation of postnatal cardiomyocytes 16 , for cardioprotection provided by ischemic preconditioning 17 and for limiting cell death following myocardial infarction 18 , 19 . What is less known is how mitochondrial clearance processes are spatially controlled . During cell growth and differentiation , coordi - nated microtubule and actin dynamics position functional mitochon - drial to speci \ufb01 c intracellular locales that couple local energy production with metabolic needs . Following damage , mitochondria relocate to subcellular regions that facilitate their clearance which , in many cell types , involves retrograde traf \ufb01 cking to peri - nuclear lysosomes 20 , 21 . While recent studies indicate that actin remodeling can facilitate Parkin - dependent mitochondrial clearance 22 \u2013 27 , the underlying players that coordinate localized cytoskeletal remodeling to facilitate the traf \ufb01 cking and clearance of damaged mitochondria remain unclear . The GRAF family of RhoA GTPase activating proteins ( GAP ) are poised to co - regulate actin - and lipid - dynamics by virtue of their shared multi - domain structure 28 \u2013 32 . We previously reported that Arh - gap26 which encodes for GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with Focal adhesion kinase ) is strongly expressed in highly metabolic tis - sues ( i . e . heart , brain , andskeletalmuscle ) andisimportant forlimiting RhoA - dependent F - actin formation and for maintenance of striated muscle tissues 28 \u2013 33 . We now demonstrate that GRAF1 is rapidly recrui - ted to damaged mitochondria where , upon phosphorylation by PINK1 ( and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases ) , it facilitates mitophagosome for - mation by controlling localized actin remodeling , mitochondrial traf - \ufb01 cking , and Parkin - LC3 interactions . This pathway is conserved between various cell types , and data from patient samples and pre - clinical mouse models indicate that GRAF1 dysregulation contributes to ( and may be a viable therapeutic target for ) heart failure and per - haps other cardiometabolic or neurological diseases that result from failed mitochondrial clearance . Results GRAF1 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart We previously demonstrated that GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly exa - cerbated cardiac and skeletal muscle degeneration in the mdx model of Duchenne \u2019 s muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) 32 . Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a well - known pathological feature of DMD and stress - induced cardiomyopathies and that myo \ufb01 ber necrosis occurs because of failed clearance of damaged mitochondria in such models 34 , 35 , we explored the possibility that GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency alone might impact mitochondrial function . In support of this possibility , ultrastructural imaging of wild type ( WT ) mouse hearts revealed uniform ovoid mitochondria arranged as parallel arrays alongside myo \ufb01 brils while hearts isolated from a GRAF1 - germline de \ufb01 cient mouse line , GRAF1 gt / gt ( which harbors the gene trapping vector VICTR48 within the \ufb01 rst intron of Graf1 33 ) had a signi \ufb01 cantly higher number of mitochondria that were small , more round and more randomly dispersed ( Fig . 1a \u2013 c ; Fig . S1a \u2013 c ) suggesting compromised cardiac mitochondrial \ufb01 tness . Accordingly , siRNA - mediated depletion of GRAF1 from neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ( NRVCMs ; Fig . S1d , e ) led to mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization ( reducedred : greenratioofJC - 1staining ; Fig . 1d , e ) , and reduced respiratory capacity ( assessed by Seahorse stress test ; Fig . 1f , g ) . To con \ufb01 rm a cardiomyocyte - autonomous role for GRAF1 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis , we developed a mouse line using \u2018 knock - out - \ufb01 rst \u2019 targetingvectorsfromEucommtoconditionally target the GRAF1 allele . Southern blot analysis con \ufb01 rmed successful targeting in embryonic stem cells ( ES ) and germline transmission chimeras ( Tm1a ) , which were subsequently crossed with Flp recom - binase mice to remove a neomycin resistance cassette used for ES cell selection . We next established a cardiomyocyte - speci \ufb01 c GRAF1 knockoutmouseline ( GRAF1 CKO ) bycrossingGRAF1Tm1c ( \ufb02 oxed ) mice withthe \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer ( MCM ) line ( J AX line005657 ) whichledtoa signi \ufb01 cant reduction in cardiac GRAF1 following tamoxifen treatment . As shown in Fig . 1h \u2013 j and Table S1 , cardiac physiology was maintained in adult GRAF1 CKO mice following acute GRAF1 depletion . However , treatment with isoproterenol ( ISO ) , an \u03b1 - adrenergic agonist that increases cardiacenergy demand 36 , provoked dysfunction in GRAF1 CKO mice , indicatingthatGRAF1 de \ufb01 ciencyconferssusceptibilitytocardiac stress . Notably , dysfunction was not accounted for by changes in compensatory hypertrophy as no signi \ufb01 cant differences were observed in cardiomyocyte cross - sectional areas ( Fig . S1f , g ) . GRAF1 facilitates mitochondrial quality control Given the accumulation of small , dysfunctional mitochondria in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient hearts and the lack of adaptation of GRAF1 CKO mice to anISOchallenge , wereasonedthatGRAF1mightplayanimportantrole in regulating mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion and / or mitochondrial quality con - trol . In support of the latter , GRAF1 depletion attenuated levels of activated LC3 as assessed by turnover of autophagosome - localized , cleaved , and lipidated form ( LC3 - II ) in the presence and absence of the lysosome inhibitor , chloroquine ( Fig . S1h , i ) . Activated LC3 is a protein marker reliably associated with completed autophagosomes 37 and our \ufb01 ndings are consistent with a prior study which reported that GRAF1 promotes LC3II production and autophagosome number in Hela cells 38 . Importantly , LC3II / LC3I ratios were also signi \ufb01 cantly lower in saline and ISO treated GRAF1 CKO hearts relative to similarly treated controls ( Fig . 1k , l ) . Moreover , we quanti \ufb01 ed the presence of mitochondria - associated autophagic vacuoles in hearts from ISO - treated wild - type ( wt ) and GRAF1 CKO mice by TEM , and as shown in representative Fig . 1m , we observed signi \ufb01 cantly fewer mitophago - somes per unit area in GRAF1 CKO hearts . Additionally , we observed increased mitochondria - associated glycogen accumulation ( Fig . 1m , Fig . S1j ) , consistent with defects in autophagy and / or inef \ufb01 cient utili - zation of glycogen as a substrate . Taken together , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 facilitates cardiac autophagy under both physio - logical and high energy demand situations . LC3 - mediated , autophagosome - dependent clearance processes can be non - selective ( which generally occurs in response to energy starvation and randomly engulfs various organelles ) or selective which typicallyoccursinresponsetochangingenvironmentalconditionsand Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 2 results in the elimination of speci \ufb01 c damaged organelles . To distin - guish between these processes , we next examined levels of p62 ( also known as Sequestosome 1 , or SQSTM1 ) a substrate degraded by gen - eral autophagy . As shown in Fig . S1h , i , p62 did not accumulate in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs . Instead , GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCM exhibited higher levels of cleaved Caspase 3 , indicative of increased presence of dysfunctional mitochondria . To further explore a role for GRAF1 in mitochondrial - selective autophagy , we next used a well - characterized model that involves subjectingcellstoatreatmentwitholigomycin - Aandantimycin - A ( OA ) to induce respiratory - failure mediated mitochondrial damage . As shown in Fig . S1k , l , OA treatment led to a signi \ufb01 cant accumulation of inner mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial matrix proteins in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs , suggesting that GRAF1 is necessary for Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 WT GRAF1 KO LVID ; d LVID ; s LVID ; d LVID ; s GRAF1 CKO ISO WT ISO GRAF1 LC3B Merge V eh i c l e O A 20h O A 20h + B a f il o m yc i n ( 4h ) LC3ILC3II GAPDH GRAF1 WT CKO WT CKO Saline ISO 75 15 37 kDa - - - 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 L C 3 II / L C 3 I Saline ISO WT CKO WT CKO Tamoxifen IP ECHO ECHO ECHO ISO Infusion Sample collection Day - 7 Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 L V F S % ns ns Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 L VE F % KOWT ns ns Day 0 Day 7 Day 14 G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 20 40 60 A T P P r odu c t i on r e l a t ed O CR ( p m o l e s / m i n ) ATP production G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 500 1000 1500 M a x i m a l R e s p i r a t i on ( p m o l e s / m i n ) Maximal Respiration G F P S i 0 500 1000 1500 S pa r e R e s p i r a t o r y C apa c i t y ( p m o l e s / m i n ) Spare Respiratory Capacity G R A F 1 S i 0 20 40 60 80 100 6 8 10 12 Time ( minutes ) O CR ( Log 2 p m o l e s / m i n ) OligomycinCCCP Rotenone & Antimycin A GFP Si GRAF1 Si h i j k l m n o HSP60 GRAF1 Merge O A 6h C oun t Aspect Ratio 250 200 150 100 50 01 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 GRAF1 gt / gt Mean WT Mean GRAF1 gt / gt WT Area ( microns 2 ) C oun t 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 50 100 0 GRAF1 gt / gt Mean WT Mean GRAF1 gt / gt WT W T G R A F 1 g t / g t f g 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 10 6 10 6 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 1 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 10 6 10 6 R ed F l uo r e sc en c e Green Fluorescence Green Fluorescence GFP Si GRAF1 Si G F P S i G R A F 1 S i 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 J C 1 S t a i n i ng ( r ed / g r een r a t i o ) * * a b c d e Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 3 maintaining homeostatic control of mitochondrial biogenesis and clearance . Mitofusin1 , whichisknowntobedegradedbytheubiquitin - proteosomesystemfollowingmitochondrialdamage , wasdegradedto a similar extent in control and GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cells , indicating that mitochondria were equally damaged by this treatment ( Fig . S1k ) . PGC1 \u03b1 , a transcriptional co - activator and central mediator of mito - chondrial biogenesis was signi \ufb01 cantly reduced ( not increased ) in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient NRVCMs ( Fig . S1m ) . Taken together , these data indi - cate that the increase in mitochondria in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cardiomyo - cytes is likely due to failed mitochondrial clearance . In strong support of a role for GRAF1 in mediating cardiomyocyte mitophagy , using a combination of confocal and structured illumination microscopy in NRVCM , weshowedthatOApromotedtherecruitmentofendogenous GRAF1 to circularized structures that co - labeled with Parkin ( Fig . S1n , o ) , the outer mitochondrial membrane marker , Tomm20 ( Fig . S1p , q ) , and LC3 ( Fig . 1n ; a phenotype particularly obvious when cells were treated with ba \ufb01 lomycin A to inhibit lysosome activity ) , and surround the mitochondrial matrix as marked by HSP60 ( Fig . 1o ) . GRAF1 promotes Parkin - mediated recruitment of autophago - somes to damaged mitochondria To explore a direct role for GRAF1 in mediating mitophagy , we next turned to a well - validated Hela / YFP - Parkin cell line in which stable expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin enables marked mito - chondrial clearance within 24 hr following OA or CCCP - induced mitochondrial dysfunction 39 . Importantly , GRAF1 depletion by siRNA treatment ( or by CRISPR - mediated knock - out ) signi \ufb01 cantly mitigated OA - induced mitochondrial turnover in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells as asses - sed either by stabilization of mitochondrial inner membrane and matrixprotein levels by Western blotting or by mitochondrialstaining , suggesting that GRAF1 plays a critical role in Parkin - mediated mito - phagy ( Fig . 2a \u2013 c , Fig . S2a \u2013 g ) . As further con \ufb01 rmation that this model involves autophagosome - dependent clearance , we showed that , like depletion of GRAF1 , depletion of the core autophagosomal elongation protein , autophagy related gene 12 ( ATG12 40 ) fully attenuated OA - mediated degradation of inner membrane and matrix proteins ( but not mitofusin 1 ) in YFP / Parkin Hela cells ( Fig . S2a , b ) . Moreover , Atg12 depletion led to a marked increase in GRAF1 levels indicating that endogenous GRAF1 may be degraded in an autophagy - dependent fashion ( Fig . S2a , b ) . Providing additional con \ufb01 rmation of GRAF1 \u2019 s role in Parkin - mediated mitophagy , while GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency suppressed mitochondrial clearance in Hela cells expressing YFP - Parkin when subjected to OA treatment , GRAF1 de \ufb01 ciency did not impact the degradation of mitochondria in the parent , Parkin - de \ufb01 cient sHela cells ( Fig . S2c and d ) . This observation reinforces the notion that GRAF1 plays a crucial role in the context of Parkin - dependent mitophagy triggered by OA treatment . Moreover , while OA treatment promoted signi \ufb01 cant degradation of mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix proteins in YFP / Parkin - Hela cells , it led to a slight but signi \ufb01 cant increase in levels of P62 ( Fig . S2e ) , a protein typically targeted for degradation within autolysosomes , serving as an indicator of autop - hagic degradation activity . Notably , P62 also functions as an adapter protein for the clearance of mitochondria . This \ufb01 nding suggests that under the conditions of OA - induced mitophagy , the general autop - hagy machinery undergoes a shift from the conventional autophagy pathway to a selective clearance pathway , speci \ufb01 cally aimed at degrading damaged mitochondria . To begin to understand how GRAF1 might facilitate mitophagy , we \ufb01 rst undertook an af \ufb01 nity puri \ufb01 cation - mass spectrometry approach to identify mitophagy - dependent GRAF1 binding proteins . Surprisingly , Parkin itself was identi \ufb01 ed as a GRAF1 binding partner in OA - treated cells as assessed byLC - MS / MS ( 16 . 8 % peptide coverage ) . In support of this possibility , using confocal imaging we found that , like in cardiomyocytes , OA treatment promoted the recruitment of endo - genous GRAF1 to the Tomm20 - labeled OMM of Parkin - associated mitochondria ( Fig . 2d , Fig . S2h ) . Moreover , reciprocal co - IPs ( Fig . 2e , f ; Fig . S2i ) con \ufb01 rmed a physical association between GRAF1 and Parkin . Using a standard deletion analysis , we proceeded to map the GRAF1 interaction site on Parkin to two strings of highly conserved residues ( aa101 - 110 and aa116 - 123 ) within a linker region located between the N - terminal ubiquitin - like domain ( UBL ) and the RING - between - RING ( RBR ) super - domain that is only fully exposed upon Parkin activation ( Fig . 2f ) 41 , 42 . Notably , reduced GRAF1 association was observed with both the ubiquitination - defective Parkin variant ( C431S ) and the linker variant ( hereafter referred to as \u0394 18 ; Fig . S2j ) . Since \u0394 18 is equally modi \ufb01 ed by ubiquitination , these data indicate that it is the exposure of this activation - induced linker , not Parkin ubiquitination that is cri - tical for GRAF1 binding . To our knowledge , GRAF1 is the only protein identi \ufb01 ed to date to interact within this activation - dependent domain . In keeping with the idea that GRAF1 acts downstream of Parkin to facilitate mitophagy , we found that Parkin , GRAF1 and LC3 form a complex in cells upon Parkin activation by PINK1 ( Fig . S2k ) and that GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly reduced LC3 \u2019 s interactions with Parkin , suggesting that GRAF1 may function to target autophagosomes to damaged mitochondria ( Fig . 2g ) . To further explore this possibility , we employed a validated mitophagy reporter cell line that co - expresses mCherry - ParkinandGFP - LC3 .

However , mitochondria - autophagosome associations were signi \ufb01 cantly reduced in similarly treated GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 promotes mitophagy by driving mitophagosome production . We also noted that peri - nuclear clustering of damaged ( Parkin - labeled ) mitochondria was reduced in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells relative Fig . 1 | GRAF1 is essential for cardiac mitochondrial homeostasis . a \u2013 c Representative TEM and histogram analysis of mitochondrial size and aspect ratio in GRAF1 gt / gt hearts relative to genetic control ( WT ) . b Nonparametric kernel - smoothing distributions of mitochondrial cross - sectional areas ( CSAs ) from TEMs of hearts from wild - type ( blue solid line ) and GRAF1 gt / gt ( red solid line ) mice .

While some mitochondrial clustering does occur in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells after 16 hr OA treatment as assessed by ATP5B staining ( Fig . S2f ) or TEM ( Fig . S2l ) , the extent of clustering was still diminished relative to similarly treated control cells . Thus , GRAF1 \u2019 s presence makes peri - nuclear clustering more ef \ufb01 cient . Moreover , consistent with the idea that peri - nuclear mitochondrial clustering facilitates delivery of damaged mitochondria to lysosomes , the association between mitochondria and LAMP1 - labeled lysosomes was markedly reduced in OA - treated GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient Hela / Parkin cells relative to similarly treated controls ( Fig . S2m ) . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 acts downstream of Parkin to promote autophagosome capture and to facilitate traf \ufb01 cking events that enhance mitochon - drial clearance .

Subsequent cell fractionation studies revealed that the mod - i \ufb01 ed GRAF1 form localized almost exclusively to mitochondria in CCCP - treated cells ( Fig . 3a , see Fig . S3a for quanti \ufb01 cation ) . Further studies in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells revealed that an OA - dependent mobility shift was apparent at 1h and peaked by 6h following treat - ment ( Fig . 3b ) , a time course consistent with clustering of depolarized mitochondria 20 . Accordingly , this modi \ufb01 cation was induced to a much greater extent in conditions that promote Parkin dependent mito - phagy ( i . e . OA treatment ) compared to those that promote Parkin - independent macroautophagy ( i . e . serum and glucose deprivation ; Fig . S3b ) . A requirement for active Parkin was con \ufb01 rmed by comparing GRAF1 mobility in lysates from OA - treated sHela cells ( that are Parkin - de \ufb01 cient ) with the YFP - Parkin stable expressing HeLa cell line ( Fig . S3c ) . Since this mobility shift was even more apparent when a phosphate - trapping electrophoresis method was applied ( Phos - tag ) andwaslargelyreversedbytreatmentwithcalf - intestinalphosphatase , we reasoned these modi \ufb01 cations were most likely due to phosphor - ylation ( Fig . 3b ) . We initially applied a proteomic approach to identify mitophagy - dependent GRAF1 modi \ufb01 cations . Unfortunately , while we did detect several phosphorylated GRAF1 peptides , no phosphopeptides were recovered that exhibited signi \ufb01 cant PINK1 / Parkin \u2014 dependent phos - phorylation . Upon closer evaluation of the 44 % peptide coverage observed , we noticed lack of coverage of the serine / proline ( SP ) - rich region of GRAF1 . As further in silico approaches indicated lack of reasonable protease cleavage sites within this region , we proceeded with a standard deletion approach that focused on this area . As shown in Fig . 3c and d , deletion of amino acids 658 - 703 nearly completely mitigated OA - dependent GRAF1 phosphorylation in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells . We next individuallymutated the 20 serine or threonine residues in this domain to a phosphor - de \ufb01 cient alanine and explored the mobility of these variants in un - treated ( Fig . S3d ) and OA - treated conditions ( Fig . 3e ) . Using this deconstructive approach , we identi \ufb01 ed three major sites of phosphorylation , S668 , T670 and S671 each of which were evolutionarily invariant in GRAF1 ( Fig . 3e , f ) . These amino acids were also conserved in other GRAF family members ( albeit in different combinations ) indicating the likely importance of this reg - ulatory region . For example , T670 and S671 are conserved in human GRAF2 , S668andS671inhumanGRAF3andT670wasconservedinthe related human protein Oligophrenin . We next developed a speci \ufb01 c antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of GRAF1 on S668 , T670 , and / or S671 and con \ufb01 rmed that OA treatment induced GRAF1 phos - phorylaiton of these sites ( Fig . S3e ) . We also used this tool to con \ufb01 rm that phosphorylated GRAF1selectivelyaccumulatesondamagedmitochondria . Tothisend , we developed a sophisticated APEX2 - based enzyme - catalyzed proxi - mity biotinylation system 43 . This method involves the fusion of a peroxidase enzyme to a bait protein ( in this case an OMM targeting domain ) that ef \ufb01 ciently biotinylates proteins within a 10 nm radius following addition of biotin - phenol ( BP ) and hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) . Biotinylated proteins can then be puri \ufb01 ed ( and quanti \ufb01 ed ) following precipitation with streptavidin - labeled beads . As shown in Fig . S3f , immunoblotsofstreptavidinprecipitatesfromvehicle - treated APEX2 - OMM / Hela - Parkin cells stimulated with H 2 0 2 and BP for 30s , revealed a small but detectible level of GRAF1 . But , consistent with our cell fractionation studies , signi \ufb01 cantly more GRAF1 was apparent in streptavidin precipitates from APEX2 - OMM / Hela - Parkin cells treated with OA for 2 hr prior to 30 s stimulation with H 2 0 2 and BP . Moreover , immunoblotting with GRAF1 p668 / 670 / 671 Ab and Parkin revealed mitochondrial - exclusive biotinylation of phosphorylated GRAF1 and active ( polyubiqutinated ) Parkin in OA / H 2 0 2 / BP - treated cells . These data con \ufb01 rm that phosphorylated GRAF1 accumulates on mitochon - dria in a depolarization - dependent fashion . Given the accumulation of phosphorylated GRAF1 on damaged mitochondria , we next explored the exciting possibility that GRAF1 might be one of a select few bona \ufb01 de PINK1 substrates . In support of this likelihood , siRNA - mediated depletion of PINK1 reduced OA - stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous GRAF1 in Hela / YFP - Par - kinasassessedbybothachangeinmobilityonSDS - PAGEandPhos - tag gelsandbyintensityofdetectionwithourphosphorylation - speci \ufb01 cAb ( Fig . 3g ) . Importantly , the capacity of active PINK1 to directly phos - phorylate full length GRAF1 was con \ufb01 rmed using in vitro kinase assays with puri \ufb01 ed PINK1 and GRAF1 fusion proteins ( Fig . 3h ) . Notably , mutation of either S668 or S671 to alanine signi \ufb01 cantlyreduced PINK1 - mediated phosphorylation of GRAF1 . Collectively , these studies pro - vide strong support for GRAF1 as a substrate for PINK1 itself and / or additional PINK1 / Parkin - dependent kinases . PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 promotes mito - chondrial WAVE2 complex formation and mitochondrial clustering As noted above , one of the \ufb01 rst defects observed in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells was a lack of perinuclear clustering following mitochondrial depolarization . Of major importance , WT GRAF1 , but not a 668 / 670 / 671 triple alanine GRAF1 variant ( hereafter referred to as GRAF1 AAA ) , restored OA - induced perinuclear mitochondrial clustering and degradation in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient Hela / YFP - Parkin cells . This \ufb01 nding indicated an important functional consequence of PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation ( Fig . 3i \u2013 k ) . We next used LC - MS / MS to identify pro - teins that differentially IP \u2019 d with WT GRAF1 versus GRAF1 AAA in Hela / YFP - Parkin cells following OA treatment ( ProteomeXchange ID PXD043212 ) . Given the impact of GRAF1 phosphorylation on mito - chondrialclustering , wefocused further efforts on proteins that might be expected to impact mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking . One such protein , Abelson - interactor adaptor - 2 ( ABI2 ) was signi \ufb01 cantly enriched in WT versus GRAF1 AAA IPs . This was intriguing because ABI2 is known to play a role in the positioning and activation of the Wiskott \u2013 Aldrich syn - drome protein family member , WAVE2 a major regulator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation that was previously implicated in Fig . 2 | GRAF1 promotes Parkin - dependent mitophagy in Hela cells by facil - itating autophagosome capture . a , b siRNA transfected Hela / YFP - Parkin cells weretreatedwithOAforindicatedtimesandlevelsofmitochondrialproteinswere detected and quanti \ufb01 ed by Western blot / densitometry ( b ) n = 3 independent experiments . c Quanti \ufb01 cation of mitochondria in Hela / YFP - Parkin cellsasassessed by ATP5B staining ( n = 50 cells from 3 independent experiments ; see Fig .

Con \ufb01 rmatory studies revealed that ABI2 co - IPd with GRAF1 in an OA - dependent fashion and revealed that this interaction was dependent on GRAF1 phosphorylation ( note reduced binding of the AAA variant ; Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , in strong support of a functional consequence of this interaction , GRAF1 depletion markedly reduced ABI2 : WAVE2 complex formation ( Fig . 4b see Fig . S3g for quanti \ufb01 cation ) . Using GST - fusion precipitation , we further con \ufb01 rmed a direct association between ABI2 and GRAF1 and mapped the interaction site to the GRAF1 SH3 domain ( Fig . S3h ) . While ABI2 strongly interacted with the isolated SH3 domain , it failed to interact with a construct that also contained the upstream serine / proline ( SP ) rich domain that harbors PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation sites ( Fig . S3h ; Fig . 4c ) .

In strong support of this idea , mutation of S668 / T670 / S671 to phosphorylation mimetic DDD or EEE variants rendered the GRAF1 SP - SH3 fusion protein capable of ABI2 binding ( Fig . 4c ) . Moreover , co - IP experiments revealed that the full length phosphomimetic variant ( GRAF1DDD ) strongly interacted with ABI2 even in the absence of OA treatment ( Fig . 4d ) , further con \ufb01 rming the function of PINK1 - dependent phosphorylations . GRAF1 facilitates actin remodeling to promote PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy There is a growing realization of the importance of actin cytoskeletal remodeling in macro - and selective autophagy 21 , 44 . Generally , RhoA dependent F - actin cables limit mitophagy , while Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin polymers facilitate the process by promoting autop - hagosome formation and lysosomal transport . However , it is not cur - rently clear how these processes are controlled in a spatial and temporal fashion following mitochondrial depolarization . Given that GRAF1 limits RhoA - dependent F - actin formation 28 \u2013 33 , and is dynami - callyrecruitedtodepolarizedmitochondriawhereitassociateswithan Arp2 / 3 regulator in a PINK1 / Parkin - dependent fashion , we postulated that GRAF1 might function to interconnect actin remodeling with mitochondrial depolarization to facilitate mitophagy . In strong sup - port of this possibility , GRAF1 depletion signi \ufb01 cantly reduced OA - dependent recruitment of the WAVE2 complex ( WAVE2 , ABI2 and CYFIP1 ) to mitochondria as assessed by subcellular fractionation ( Fig . 4e , f ) . We next used super resolution microscopy ( SR - SIM ) and confocal imaging to monitor mitochondrial - associated actin following OA treatment . In control cells , OA treatment led to the dissolution of linear F - actin \ufb01 laments and the formation of small actin bundles and this remodeling was temporally associated with mitochondrial clus - tering . In contrast , OA - mediated F - actin dissolution was attenuated in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells and mitochondria failed to cluster and remained associated with peripheral linear actin bundles ( Fig . 4g , h , Fig . S3i , see Fig . S3jforquanti \ufb01 cation ) . Treatment withtheArp2 / 3inhibitor , CK666 partially phenocopied the impairment of F - actin remodeling and mitochondrial clustering ( Fig . S3k ) , and the impairment of mitochon - drial clearance ( as assessed by HSP60 levels ; Fig . S3l , m ) observed in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cells . Treatment with the F - actin polymerization drug , latrunculin B ( LatB ) , which limits stress \ufb01 ber formation , signi \ufb01 cantly ( although not completely ) rescued mitochondrial clustering defects in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cells ( Fig . 4i and j , Fig . S3n ) . Collectively , these data support a model in which following mitochondrial depolarization , GRAF1 facilitates localized F - actin depolymerization which both releases mitochondria from F - actin cablesandgeneratesG - actinmonomersfornascent polymerization . In turn , GRAF1 phosphorylation is induced in a PINK1 - Parkin dependent fashion on damaged mitochondria which leads to ABI2 recruitment , WAVE2 complex formation and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin formation that is necessary for mitochondrial clearance . Thus , GRAF1 is distinctive from other mitophagy receptors because it facilitates mitophagy by serving not only as a Parkin to autophagosome scaffold , but also as an enzyme that promotes local mitochondria \u2010 associated actin remodeling ( see Fig . 4k ) . GRAF1 CKO hearts exhibit impaired metabolic \ufb02 exibility following isoproterenol challenge Given that cardiomyocytes exhibit a unique cytoskeletal and mito - chondrial organization , we sought to con \ufb01 rm that GRAF1 also pro - motes mitochondrial clearance in a PINK1 / Parkin / LC3 and actin remodeling - dependent fashion in these cells . In support of this pos - sibility , OA treatment induced rapid PINK1 - dependent phosphoryla - tion of GRAF1 on 668 / 670 / 671 in isolated cardiomyocytes ( Fig . 5a \u2013 d ) . Furthermore , OA treatment promoted the recruitment of endogenous GRAF1 to mitochondria that were associated with branched actin \ufb01 la - ments ( Fig . 5e ) . Importantly , OA \u2014 induced actin remodeling and mitochondrial circularization and clustering were all signi \ufb01 cantly reduced in GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient cardiomyocytes ( Fig . 5f , g ) . Mounting evidence in the \ufb01 eld indicates that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are intrinsically linked ( i . e . mitophagy pro - motesmitochondriabiogenesisviaPINK / Parkin - mediateddegradation of apowerful PGC - 1 \u03b1 transcriptional repressor , PARIS ) 45 . Thus , wenext sought to test the extent to which GRAF1 was necessary for a mitophagy - dependenthomeostaticcircuitinintacthearts . Tothisend , we subjected WTand GRAF1 gt / gt mice to hyperoxia - a stress that loosely mimics the changes in oxygen exposure that occurs at birth and has been shown to promote mitophagy - dependent mitochondrial biogenesis 46 . As shown in Fig . 5h , hyperoxia induced mitochondrial biogenesis in WT hearts as assessed by increased expression of PGC1 \u03b1 target genes that regulate mitochondrial transcription ( PPAR \u03b3 ) , the TCA cycle ( citrate synthase ) , and OXPHOS ( COXIV ) . In contrast , hyperoxia treatment did not signi \ufb01 cantly alter expression of these genes in GRAF1 gt / gt hearts . These data further substantiate a role for GRAF1 inpromoting mitochondrialquality control in the myocardium . Consistent with prior studies that ISO treatment also induces car - diac mitophagy 36 , acute treatment of mice with ISO also led to pro - nounced phosphorylation of GRAF1 ( Fig . 5i , j ) . To further con \ufb01 rm that GRAF1 plays a crucial role in adult cardiomyocyte mitophagy , we per - formed additional experiments using the powerful mt - Keima mouse model . Mt - Keima is a pH sensitive \ufb02 orescent protein that is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the N - terminal targeting signal of COX8A and has been validated as a rigorous and reproducible reporter to track PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy in vivo 47 . Using this model system , we show that hearts from ISO - treated mt - Keima / GRAF1 CKO mice have signi \ufb01 cantly lower levels of mitophagy than hearts from similarly trea - ted mt - Keima / GRAF1 + / + mice ( Fig . 5k , l ) . Thus , when taken together with evidence that mitophagy - dependent mitochondrial biogenesis Fig . 3 | PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 promotes retrograde mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking and clustering . a siRNA transfected Hela / YFP - Parkin cells were treated with CCCP or vehicle .

S3o ) . These \ufb01 ndings indicate that GRAF1 CKO hearts exhibited impaired ability to ef \ufb01 ciently utilize carbohydrate as an alternative substrate for energy production , a \ufb01 nding consistent with our ultra - structural data that revealed notable accumulation of glycogen around mitochondria in GRAF1 CKO hearts ( see Fig . 1m ) . In support of these \ufb01 ndings , similar ( albeit more modest ) differences were observed in serum metabolites isolated from the ISO - treated mice ( e . g . ISO - treated WT mouse serum exhibited signi \ufb01 cantly higher levels of metabolites derived from fructose / mannose metabolism , the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis / gluconeogenesis ) , whereas none of these metabolites were signi \ufb01 cantly different between saline - treated WT and GRAF1 CKO mice . Indeed , only 5 of the 224 metabolites detected in serum samples differed between saline treated animals , consistent with the notion that GRAF1 - dependent processes are employed under condi - tionsofhighenergydemand . Thehighlevelsofglycolyticintermediates observed in serum from WT animals is consistent with prior studies showing that cardiac stress promotes a change in fuel utilization in the myocardium from predominantly fatty acid consumption to glycolysis 49 . Instead , GRAF1 CKO hearts had altered amino acid metabo - lism and produced lower levels of ATP , indicating a lack of metabolic \ufb02 exibility \u2014 a process recently linked to mitochondrial quality control mechanisms including mitophagy 50 . Finally , in strong support of a critical role for GRAF1 - dependent mitophagy in the pathological progression of human disease , we found that GRAF1 phosphorylation at PINK1 / Parkin - dependent sites was dysregulated in cardiac samples from patients diagnosed with either hypertrophicor dilated cardiomyopathy ( HCM or DCM ) relative to age and sex matched controls ( Fig . 5o , Fig . S3p , see Table S2 for individualized patient data ) . When taken together with the signi \ufb01 cant reduction in mitochondrial content ( as assessed by Hsp60 levels ) and total GRAF1 protein , these \ufb01 ndings are in keeping with disruptions in mitochondrial homeostasis in HF . Collectively , these \ufb01 ndings indicate that dysregulation of GRAF1 expression or activity may exacerbate heart failure and possibly other disorders that result from defects in PINK1 / Parkin - mediated mitochondrial quality control . Discussion Recent \ufb01 ndings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the overriding pathophysiological hallmarks of numerous cardiometa - bolic , skeletal - , and neuro - degenerative diseases 15 , 35 , 51 , 52 . Unfortunately , effective strategies to promote the clearance of damaged mitochon - dria are currently lacking . This is due , at least in part , to the fact that severalproteins involved in this processhave redundant functions and relatively few of the essential proteins identi \ufb01 ed to date have targe - table enzymatic moieties . Herein , we identi \ufb01 ed GRAF1 as a mitophagy regulator that plays a fundamental role in facilitating PINK1 / Parkin - dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria . Our data support a model in which mitochon - drial membrane depolarization triggers partial GRAF1 translocation to theOMMofdamagedmitochondriawhereitisphosphorylatedbyPINK1 and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases . Phosphorylated GRAF1 then forms a physical interaction with active Parkin and promotes capture and encasement of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes . Our tem - poral approaches suggest that GRAF1 does not impact the initial recruitment of Parkin or the autophagy receptor OPTN 20 , 52 , but acts downstream as an enzyme that promotes localized actin remodeling to facilitatemitochondrialtraf \ufb01 cking and clearance . Thefutureapplication of high powered , real time imaging to track the fates of individual mitochondria and localized actin \ufb01 bers during mitochondrial clearance will be necessary to provide further support for this conclusion and to shed light on additional unanswered questions in the \ufb01 eld regarding the precise mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal clearance of damaged mitochondria in various cell types . Actin dynamics and mitochondrial homeostasis Actin has been long known to regulate mitochondrial \ufb01 ssion , fusion and traf \ufb01 cking , and more recent studies indicate that actin plays a wider role in mitochondrial clearance 21 , 22 , 44 . Cytoplasmic actin exists as monomeric units ( G - actin ) or in polymerized states that can be bran - ched or linear ( F - actin ) . F - actin \ufb01 laments are formed by RhoA \u2014 dependent activation of mDia and the formin family of actin binding proteins while branched actin is formed by Rac1 - dependent processes and the coordinated activity of the Actin - related protein 2 / Actin - rela - ted protein 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex and various nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , including WAVEs , WASP , WASH , and others . Recent studies have shown that during general autophagy , local assembly of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin \ufb01 laments is necessary to support formation of nascent autophagosomes and for the expansion , trans - port , and fusion of the autophagsomes with lysosomes 23 \u2013 25 , 53 . During mitophagy , Arp2 / 3 - and myosin ( MyoV1 ) - mediated actin remodeling has been further implicated in forming protective shells around dysfunctional mitochondria and in dispersing clumps of damaged mitochondria to facilitate subsequent autophagosome cap - ture and clearance 26 , 53 . The prevailing model is that rapid formation of protective shells or cages can shield the cell from dangerous mito - chondrial byproducts ( i . e . ROS ) and / or contents ( i . e . cytochrome C , mitochondrial DNA ) that are released by dysfunctional mitochondria and , at the same time , prevent re - fusion of the damaged mitochondria with their healthy neighbors until autophagosomes can be generated andrecruitedtocleartheseorganelles . However , anumberofimportant questions remain with respect to the formation of these structures such as : What is the mechanism by which Arp2 / 3 is activated following mitochondrial depolarization ? Which NPFs are involved in mitochondrial - localized Arp2 / 3 activation ? How are the actin shells removed or dissambled to allow encapsulation by the autophagosome ?

Mitochondrial poisoning promotes rapid F - actin depolymerization , and the impor - tance of this event is underscored by recent studies indicating that F - actin impedes mitophagy and exacerbates Parkinson \u2019 s - like pheno - types in animal models . Indeed , Moskal et . al . identi \ufb01 ed Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitors in a discovery - based screen for small molecule activators of mitophagy and further showed that ROCK inhibitors provided protection from paraquat - mediated neurodegeneration in \ufb02 ies . Likewise , Sarcar et . al . showed that neurodegeneration in trans - genic \u03b1 - synuclein expressing \ufb02 ies was associated with excess F - actin stabilization , and the degenerative phenotype was attenuated by co - expression of the actin severing protein , gelsolin 54 .

Firstly , consistent with prior studies from our lab and others demonstrating that GRAF1 is necessary for limiting RhoA mediated F - actin formation 29 , weshowthatGRAF1aidsinpromotingmitochondrialpoison - inducedF - actin de - polymerization which both releases mitochondria from F - actin cables to facilitate mitochondrial traf \ufb01 cking and generates G - actin monomers for nascent polymerization . In turn , GRAF1 is recruited to theOMMofdamagedmitochondria , isphosphorylatedbyPINK1and / or PINK1 - dependent kinases , which facilitates WAVE2 complex formation and Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin formation that is necessary for mitochondrialclearance . Thismodelissupportedbythesimilarkinetics ofPINK1 - dependentphosphorylationandtheexclusiveaccumulationof fully phosphorylated GRAF1 on mitochondria . We provide strong evi - dence that PINK1 - dependent phosphorylation of GRAF1 relieves auto - inhibition between the GRAF1 serine - proline rich and SH3 domains to facilitate ABI2 / WAVE2 / Arp2 / 3 recruitment and mitochondrial cluster - ing . Our \ufb01 ndings that WT GRAF1 but not the triple phosphor - de \ufb01 cient GRAF1 variant can rescue mitochondrial clustering in GRAF1 de \ufb01 cient cellslendsstrongsupporttothismodel . However , itisformallypossible that other GRAF1 SH3 binding partners and / or RhoA - dependent mechanisms are involved . Because GRAF1 also facilitates autophago - some recruitment , we posit that GRAF1 has the capacity to \ufb01 ne - tune actin polymerization / depolymerization in a spatial and temporal fash - ion to ensure the quick and ef \ufb01 cient capture and clearance of damaged mitochondria . RecentstudiesinAtg7knockoutmicerevealeddefectsin both autophagosome formation and actin assembly 21 , further sup - porting an actin - mitophagy interconnection . While our studies in Hela cells support a role for GRAF1 in pro - moting retrograde traf \ufb01 cking of damaged mitochondria , very recent studies suggest that some cells including neurons , brown adipocytes , and cardiomyocytes can also eliminate damaged mitochondria into the extracellular space by autophagy - dependent anterograde traf - \ufb01 cking to the plasma membrane 21 , 55 \u2013 57 . While these events likely also require coordinated membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling events , future studies are necessary to determine the relative impact of this clearance mechanism in the heart and the extent to which GRAF1 might be involved . Likewise , while our data strongly support the contention that GRAF1 selectively promotes PINK1 - Parkin dependent mitophagy in settings in which mitochondrial membrane depolariza - tion or dysfunction is induced , it is formally possible that GRAF1 plays additional roles in general macroautophagy in conditions that favor this response , as suggested by a prior report 38 . GRAF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria Under basal conditions in healthy muscle cells , GRAF1 physically interacts with FAK in actin - associated adhesion complexes 28 and we now show for the \ufb01 rst time that upon mitochondrial damage , GRAF1 redistributes to the OMM of Parkin and LC3 - labeled mitochondria . While further studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms by which GRAF1 is recruited to damaged mitochondria , we propose a model in which the GRAF1 BAR - PH domain may mediate binding to depolarization - exposed phospholipids on the outer mito - chondrial membrane . Notably , a PH domain ligand , cardiolipin ( CL ) is rapidly transferred to the outer lea \ufb02 et of the OMM by phospholipid scramblase 3 , and its externalization is known to promote mitophagy through mechanisms that involve direct interactions with LC3 11 . Moreover , depolarization - mediated accumulation of additional phos - pholipids such as phosphatidyl serine , phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidic acid induce curvature of damaged mitochondrial membranes 11 , which could drive BAR domain - mediated interactions . The lipid - bending BAR domainof GRAF1 may serve to further facilitate inward membrane curvature - dependent mitochondrial encasement of LC3B - containing autophagosomes 58 , 59 . Future studies are warranted to determinetheextenttowhichthesemodi \ufb01 cationsmightcontributeto GRAF1 recruitment to and / or retention on damaged mitochondria . In vivo consequences and putative clinical relevance of GRAF1 - dependent mitophagy We provide strong evidence that GRAF1 is necessary for mediating PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart fol - lowing an adrenergic challenge and that GRAF1 is dysregulated in human heart failure . These data are in keeping with our prior studies showing that co - depletion of GRAF1 and dystrophin 32 unmasked car - diac and skeletal muscle phenotypes that were associated with meta - bolic dysfunction . Under each of these conditions , GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient hearts exhibited widespread \ufb01 brosis , focal necrosis , in \ufb02 ammation , signi \ufb01 cantlydecreasedejectionfractionandfractionalshortening , and ultrastructural mitochondrial defects 31 , 32 . Consistently , overall meta - bolic pro \ufb01 les from hearts and serum from ISO - treated GRAF1 CKO mice are suggestive of impaired mitophagy - dependent transition to glyco - lysis and compensatory increase in amino acid metabolism . In this regard it is interesting to note that the phenotype of cardiac GRAF1 - de \ufb01 cient mice mirrored cardiac ATG5 - de \ufb01 cient mice in that there was no signi \ufb01 cant difference in cardiac function until mice were challenged 36 . Taken together , these studies suggests that autophagy / mitophagy is not essential for basal cardiac function , but is necessary for situations in which there is a mismatch in energy supply and demand . This \ufb01 nding is in keeping with recent studies indicating that mitochondrial \ufb02 exibility is necessary to maintain energy stability and muscle function in conditions with high demand to fuel ratios 60 . Thereare a few notable limitations of our in vivo studies . Firstly , it is formally possible that additional RhoA - dependent effects could contribute to cardiac dysfunction in our model . However , it is Fig . 5 | GRAF1 is required for stress - induced metabolic adaptation in adult hearts and is dysregulated in human heart disease . a , b Endogenous GRAF1 phosphorylation in NRVCMs treated with OA and examined by Phos - tag gel and Western using GRAF1 phos - S668 / T670 / S671 Ab , and densitometric quanti \ufb01 cation ( b ) n = 3 independent experiments . c , d siRNA transfected NRVCMs were treated withOAandGRAF1phosphorylationwasexaminedusingpS668 / T670 / S671GRAF1 Ab .

Secondly , we did not include female mice in this study . Based on our prior published studies that revealed no statistical differences in cardiac function in male and female GRAF1 gt / gt mice 32 , and studies from others showing lack of sexual dimorphism in isoproterenol - induced cardiac outcomes including heart rate , hypertrophy , dysfunction , and \ufb01 brosis , we would not expect a difference between males and female mice in this parti - cular stress model 62 , however , future studies will be necessary to con \ufb01 rm this thesis . Based on our data showing that GRAF1 plays a unique role in promoting PINK1 / Parkin - dependent mitophagy , we surmise that it could regulate the pathological progression of additional cardiome - tabolic and / or neurological diseases associated with dysfunctions in mitochondrial clearance . It will be of future interest to determine if , likeParkin , GRAF1isalsonecessaryforthemetabolicmaturationthatis known to occur during early postnatal cardiac development 16 and for limiting ischemic stress - mediated injury in the adult myocardium 17 \u2013 19 . With respect to neurodegenerative disease , it is notable that nearly all PD - associated mutations impact proteins that participate in mito - chondrial quality control 52 , 63 , and GRAF1 was shown by others to be neuroprotective in a human Parkinson \u2019 s cell culture model ( MPP + \u2010 treated dopaminergic neuroblastoma SK \u2010 N \u2010 SH cells ) 64 . While related patient data are relatively scarce , 24 patients to date have been reported with GRAF1 autoimmunity , and of these cases , 83 % of patients had cerebellar ataxia ( a feature common in PD and related diseases ) , approximately 30 % exhibited cerebellar atrophy and 1 patient had been diagnosed with early stage PD 65 . Thus , our studies provide a strong rationale for a more extensive exploration of the association between Arhgap26 polymorphisms and susceptibility to heart failure , PD , and perhaps other diseases that involve metabolic dysfunction 66 .

The variable modi \ufb01 cation speci \ufb01 ed was phosphorylation of serine / threonine / tyr - osine , oxidation of methionine , protein N - terminal acetylation . LFQ was enabled . Results were \ufb01 ltered to 1 % FDR at the unique peptide level and grouped into proteins within MaxQuant 70 . Match between runs was enabled . Protein and phosphopeptide datasets were both imported into Perseus ( version 1 . 6 . 14 . 0 ) for 71 further processing . Only proteins with > 1 unique + razor peptide were used for LFQ analysis . Proteins with > 50 % missing values were removed , and missing values were replaced from normal distribution . Log2 fold change ratios ( wildtype vs control and mutant vs control ) were calculated using the averaged log2 LFQ intensities of the technical replicates for each sample group . Student \u2019 s t - test was performed for the pairwise comparisons , and p - values were calculated . Proteins were considered GRAF1 interactorsif the log2 fold change ratio compared to control was > 1 . Protein de - phosphorylation and Phos - tag gels . To dephosphorylate protein in cell lysates , cells were collected and lysed in Triton X - 100 lysis buffer as above supplemented with 10mM MgCl 2 . Calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP or Lambda PP ; New England BioLabs ) was added to half of the cell lysate and the other half was used as an untreated control . Both sampleswereincubated for30minat 37 \u00b0C and analyzed by SDS \u2013 PAGE and immunoblotting . To analyze GRAF1 phosphoryla - tionbyPhos - taggels , lysateswerepreparedinTritonX - 100lysisbuffer with 1x HALT phosphatase & protease inhibitor cocktail and run on 8 % SDS - PAGE gels containing 25 \u03bc M Phos - tag ( Wako Chemicals ) and 50 \u03bc M MnCl 2 . Regular SDS - PAGE gels were run simultaneously as control . Just aftertheelectrophoresis , thePhos - taggelsweresoaked in a general transfer buffer containing 10 mM EDTA for 15min / time with gentle agitation for two times to remove excess Mn 2 + in the gel before wet transfer . Next , the gels were soaked in a general transfer buffer without EDTA for another 10min with gentle agitation . All other steps in this analysis were identical to general SDS - PAGE and immuno - blottingprotocols . Fiji was used for quanti \ufb01 cation of bands in both normal SDS - PAGE and Phos - tag immunoblotting . Anti - Phospho - GRAF1 antibody generation . Based on GRAF1b iso - form amino acids , the following peptides were synthesized at > 90 purity by Thermo Fisher .

In a fume hood , 2 ml pH7 . 2 coupling buffer and 40 \u03bc L sodium cyanoborohydride solution ( 5M NaCNBH3 in 1 M NaOH ) was added . Resin in column was mixed by end - over - end rotation overnight at 4 \u00b0C . The next day , resin waswashed with 5mlquenching buffer ( 1 M Tris HCl , pH7 . 4 ) . In a fume hood , 2mlpH7 . 2couplingbufferand40sodium \u03bc Lcyanoborohydride solution was added to the column . The columnn was gently mixed for 30min by end - over - end rotation . Next , the column was washed with a 10ml wash solution ( 1 M NaCl ) followed by washing with 10 ml PBS containing 0 . 05 % sodium azide . The column was stored at 4 \u00b0C . Af \ufb01 nity Puri \ufb01 cation of Phospho - Antibody . 4 ml crude antiserum was spun at 2000g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove large debris , then the antiserum was diluted 1 : 1 with binding buffer ( PBS , pH7 . 4 ) . The non - phospho - peptide column was equilibrated by adding 10ml PBS and subsequentlyaddingthe diluted antiserumto the column . The column wascappedandpara \ufb01 lmwrappedandrotatedend - over - endovernight at 4 \u00b0C . The next day , antiserum \ufb02 ow - through was collected from the column , column was washed with 5 ml PBS and \ufb02 ow - through was col - lected . The \ufb02 ow - through was the mixture of antibodies that did not bind to non - phospho - peptide column and contained antibody speci \ufb01 c to the phospho - peptide . Next , the phospho - peptide column was equilibrated with 10 ml PBS , then \ufb02 ow - through fractions collected from the non - phospho - peptide column were added to the phospho - peptide column . The column was caped and para \ufb01 lm wrapped , gently inverted and the column was rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C . The next day , incubation was continued at room temperature for 1 h then \ufb02 ow - through was col - lected . Next , the column was washed with 10ml ( 5 resin - bed volume ) PBS followed by 20 ml of stringent washing buffer ( 1M NaCl , 1 % TritonX - 100 in PBS , pH7 . 4 ) . The column was washed again with 10 ml PBS prior to elution of anti - phospho - peptide antibody . 150 \u03bc l of 2 M Tris HCl pH 8 . 0 . was added to 15\u00d71 . 5m collection tubes . 15ml Elution buffer ( 0 . 1 M glycine pH 2 . 6 ) was then added to the column and 1 ml fractions were collected in each tube and immediately mixed by inversion to neutralize the sample . 5 \u03bc l of each fraction wasspotted on pH paper to evaluate neutralization . The antibody solution was transferredtoAmiconUltra - 1510Kcentrifugal \ufb01 lterdeviceandspunat 4000g for ~ 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to concentrate puri \ufb01 ed antibody . Next , concentrated antibody solution was dialyzed in 300mlPBS containing 50 % ( vol / vol ) glycerol overnight at 4 \u00b0C . Dialysis buffer was exchanged at least one time during dialysis . Lastly , ~ 0 . 05 volume of 20mg / ml BSA was added to the antibody solution to obtain 1 mg / ml BSA total , and puri \ufb01 ed antibody solution was stored at \u2013 20 \u00b0C . Transmission electron microscopy . Mouse cardiac muscle was immersed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde / 0 . 15M sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 4 and stored for several days at 4 \u00b0C . After post - \ufb01 xation in 1 % osmium tetroxide / 0 . 15 M sodium phosphate the samples were washed in deionized water , then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol ( 30 % , 50 % , 75 % , 90 % , 100 % , 100 % , 100 % ) and propylene oxide . The cardiac muscles were in \ufb01 ltrated with a 1 : 1 mix - ture of propylene oxide and Polybed 812 epoxy resin for 3 h and in \ufb01 ltrated overnight in 100 % resin ( Polysciences , Inc . , Warrington , PA ) . Samples were transferred to embedding molds and polymerized at 60 \u030a C overnight . Using a diamond knife , 1 \u00b5 m semi - thin sections were cut , mounted on slides , and stained with 1 % toluidine blue to examine by light microscopy and isolate the region of interest . Ultrathin sections ( 70 - 80 nm ) were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on 200 mesh copper grids followed by staining with 4 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 12 min and Reynold \u2019 s lead citrate for 8 min ( Reynolds , 1963 ) . Samples were observed using a JEOL JEM - 1230 transmission electron micro - scope operating at 80kV ( JEOL USA , Inc . , Peabody , MA ) and images were acquired with a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD Digital Camera and Gatan Microscopy Suite 3 . 0 software ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleasanton , CA ) . Image analysis ( FIJI ) . To quantify mitochondria cross - sectional areas and aspect ratios in the TEM of hearts , the freehand selection tool and ROI manager were used to manually de \ufb01 ne each mitochondrion as a region of interest in FIJI . Set Measurements was used to select area and shape descriptors , and Measure was used to generate tables of cross - sectional areas and aspect ratios for each mitochondrion in each TEM . The total image areas as well as areas for exclusion from analysis ( i . e . the intermyo \ufb01 brillar and nuclear spaces ) were measured by the same process for calculation of number of mitochondria per \u00b5 m2 . Mitochondrial cross - sectional areas and aspect ratios were plotted in MATLAB ( version 9 . 2 . 0 . 959691 ; R2017a ) as histograms and / or nonparametric kernel - smoothing distributions using his \ufb01 t with 20 bins . To quantify mitochondria levels by immunostaining , the ATP5B - stained mitochondria were highlighted as the region of interest ( ROI ) using the same threshold value in all samples in Fiji . Subsequently , mitochondrial volume was calculated by multiplying the cell height as determined by the z - slice distance measured using Fiji . To quantify percentage of cells with branched actin \ufb01 laments , images of cells dual labeledwith phalloidin and mitochondria marker were acquired and manually scored in a blinded fashion for the presence of branched or linear actin \ufb01 laments . To quantify mito - chondrial clustering , the extent of mitochondrial clustering was evaluated manually in a blinded fashion based on image examples depicting different levels of clustering , including none , diffuse , and focal patterns . To determine colocalization , the regions of interest ( ROI ) within the acquired images was de \ufb01 ned using the Fiji Coloc 2 plugin , a straight line within the ROI was drawn , and the intensity values of target channel ( \ufb02 uorophore ) along the selected line was measured and graphical representation of the intensity pro \ufb01 le and colocalization result was created . Metabolite extraction , pro \ufb01 ling and metabolomic data analysis . Metabolite extraction was performed as described in a previous study 74 . Following \ufb02 ash freezing ~ 30mg tissue sections were homo - genized into powder in liquid nitrogen by mortar & pestle . 3 ~ 10mg tissue powder was thoroughly mixed with 200 \u03bc l ice cold 80 % methanol ( HPLC grade ) . An additional 300 \u03bc L ice cold 80 % methanol was added in each tube and vortexed rigorously for 1min . After incu - bation onicefor 10 min , the tissue extractwas centrifuged at20 , 000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 15min . The supernatant , normalized to sample weight , was transferred and aliquoted into two clean Eppendorf tubes . Next , the tubes were speed vacuum dried at room temperature . The dry pellets were stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for liquid chromatography with high - resolution mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) analysis . Ultimate 3000 UHPLC ( Dionex ) coupled to Q Exactive Plus - Mass spectrometer ( QE - MS , Thermo Scienti \ufb01 c ) was used for metabolite pro \ufb01 ling . The dry pellets were reconstituted into 30 \u03bc L sample solvent ( water : methanol : acetonitrile , 2 : 1 : 1 , v / v ) and 3 \u03bc l was further analyzed by LC - MS . A hydrophilic interaction chromatography method ( HILIC ) employing an Xbridge amide column ( 100 \u00d72 . 1mm i . d . , 3 . 5 \u03bc m ; Waters ) was used for polar metabolite separation . Detailed LC method was described previously 75 except that mobile phase A was replaced with water containing 5mM ammonium acetate ( pH6 . 8 ) . The QE - MS was equipped with a HESI probe with related parameters set as below : heater temperature , 120\u00b0C ; sheath gas , 30 ; auxiliary gas , 10 ; sweep gas , 3 ; spray voltage , 3 . 0 kV for the positive mode and 2 . 5 kV for the negative mode ; capillary temperature , 320\u00b0C ; S - lens , 55 ; A scan range ( m / z ) of 70 to 900 wasused inpositive mode from 1 . 31 to 12 . 5min . For negativemode , ascanrangeof70to900wasusedfrom1 . 31to6 . 6min and then 100 to 1000 from 6 . 61 to 12 . 5min ; resolution : 70000 ; auto - mated gain control ( AGC ) , 3 \u00d710 6 ions . Customized mass calibration was performed before data acquisition . LC - MS peak extraction and integration were performed using commercially available software Sieve 2 . 2 ( Thermo Scienti \ufb01 c ) . The integrated peak area was used to represent the relative abundance of each metabolite in different Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 43889 - 6 Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 8187 17 samples . To avoid in \ufb01 nite values when calculate fold changes , a value 1000 was used for metabolites not detected in some samples but that have measurable signals in one or more other samples . The annotated metabolites from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) Compound database ( www . genome . jp / kegg ) and Human Metabolome Database ( HMDB ) were used for analysis . The data matrix of metabo - lites extracted from mouse hearts was normalized by sum and then wasauto - scaled ( mean - centeredanddividedbythestandarddeviation of each variable ) . The data matrix of metabolites extracted from mouse serum was normalized by median and then was auto - scaled ( mean - centered and divided by the standard deviation of each vari - able ) . Metabolite pathway analysis , hierarchical clustering and heat - map and statistical analysis was conducted using Metaboanalyst 5 . 0 ( http : / / www . metaboanalyst . ca / MetaboAnalyst / ) . Adrenergic challenge and transthoracic echocardiography . \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer / + and \u03b1 MHC - MerCreMer / + : GRAF1 \ufb02 ox / \ufb02 ox male mice ( 2 \u2013 3 - month - old ) received a single intraperitoneal injection ( IP ) injection of 40mg / kg tamoxifen ( Sigma ) dissolved in sterile peanut oil . For the chronic \u03b2 - adrenergic stimulation model , mice were treated at 7 days post tamoxifen injection with Isoproterenol ( ISO ) ( Sigma ) at a dosage of 15mg / kg / day for 14days using subcutaneously implanted Osmotic pumps ( model 2002 , Alzet ) . Cardiac physiology was evaluated by echocardiography prior to ISO infusion as well as at 7days and 14 days post ISO infusion . Transthoracic echocardiography ( ECHO ) was per - formed using a VisualSonics Vevo 2100 system equipped with MS400 transducer ( Visual Sonics ) . 2 - D guided M - mode images of the left ventriclewereobtainedfromlongaxisviewatthemid - ventricularlevel of the papillary muscles in conscious , gently restrained mice . ECHO measurements from 5 - 6 consecutive cycles were averaged using Visual Sonics software ( VevoLAB , Version - 5 . 5 . 0 ) . For acute \u03b2 - adrenergic sti - mulation model , mice were treated at 7 days post tamoxifen injection with a single subcutaneous injection of ISO ( 200mg / kg / day ) for 3 consecutive days . Heart tissues were collected 4 \u2013 6 h post the last ISO injection . To measure cardiac mitophagy , we employed confocal microscopy , following a previously described methodology 76 . GRAF1 phosphorylation in human myocardial tissue . Human myo - cardial tissue samples from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) and non - failing ( NF ) control 33 \u2013 57 - year - old male patients ( 6 samples per group ) were used in this study . Thesesamples were procured from the Duke HumanHeartRepository ( DHHR ) which isa Duke University Hospital InstitutionalReview Board approved tissue repository ( IRB No . Pro00005621 ) . Samples were obtained using informed consent or a waiver of consent for discarded tissues . Left ventricular ( LV ) cardiac tissue from HCM and DCM patients were obtained at the time of cardiac transplantation . LV car - diac tissue from NF subjects were obtained from deceased donors whose hearts were not used for transplantation . At the time of col - lection , the LV tissue was sharply dissected then \ufb02 ash frozen in a cryovial using liquid nitrogen . The tissue was stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until it was utilized . Patient data at the time of tissue procurement was ret - rospectively collected by DHHR personnel from an electronic medical record database or from organ donor records and de - identi \ufb01 ed information is presented in the Supplementary Information ( Table S2 ) . Heart tissue was homogenized in Triton X - 100 lysis buffer . GRAF1 phosphorylation in the lysate was analyzed by Western blotting as described above . Statistical calculations . Differences were analyzed by two - tailed unpaired Student \u2019 s t - test for experiments with two groups and one - way or two - way ANOVA with post - hoc Tukey \u2019 s or Sidak test for multi - ple comparisons for experiments \u2265 3 groups . A value of P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi \ufb01 cant . No statistical analysis was used to predetermine sample sizes . Data are represented as mean\u00b1 SD or mean\u00b1SEM from at least three independent experiments or at least three biological samples . In all cases similar results were found from experiment to experiment and all technically sound experiments were used in data analysis . All statistical data were calculated and graphed using GraphPad Prism 10 . 0 .

However , the significance of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in endocytosis is unknown . We found that overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation decreased transferrin uptake . Suppression of cortactin expres - sion by RNA interference also reduced transferrin internaliza - tion . Such inhibition was effectively rescued by overexpressing wild - type cortactin but not a cortactin mutant deficient in tyro - sine phosphorylation or a mutant with deletion of the Src homology 3 domain . Likewise , purified phosphorylation - null cortactin failed to restore the formation of clathrin - coated ves - icles in a cortactin - depleted cell extract . In vitro analysis revealed that Src - mediated phosphorylation enhanced the asso - ciation of cortactin with dynamin - 2 in a tyrosine phosphoryla - tion - dependent manner . Quantitative analysis demonstrated that Src enhances the affinity of cortactin for dynamin - 2 by more than 3 - fold . On the other hand , Src - treated dynamin - 2 had no effect on its interaction with cortactin . These data indi - cate that Src kinase is implicated in clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis by phosphorylation of cortactin . Receptor - mediated endocytosis constitutes an important cellular mechanism to take nutrients into cells and transduce extracellular signals essential for cell homeostasis , prolifera - tion , and differentiation . The best characterized internalization process so far is clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which involves concentration of membrane - associated receptors that are either unoccupied ( for constitutive pathway ) or occupied by their ligands ( for the ligand dependent pathway ) in a cage - like structure that is composed primarily of clathrin ( 1 ) . Under physiological conditions , assembly of clathrin - coated pits requires other coat constituents , including monomeric assem - bly protein ( AP - 180 ) and heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) , the latter of which links the clathrin cage to the cyto - plasmic domains of endocytic receptors . Invagination or scis - sion of clathrin - coated pits into the cytosol of many types of cells also requires the function of dynamin - 2 , a ubiquitously expressed member of the large GTPase family that is associated with the narrow neck of clathrin - coated pits ( 2 ) . Regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves activation of specific intracellular protein kinases that target certain components of the endocytic machinery . The molecules implicated in the assembly of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) , 3 including clathrin , AP - 2 , AP - 180 , dynamin and other proteins such as epsin , amphiphysin , and synaptotagmin , are known to serve as the substrates of either protein tyrosine or serine and threonine kinases ( 3 ) . The mechanism of phosphorylation - regulated endocytosis appears to be complicated , as phosphorylation either facilitates or hampers clathrin - mediated endocytosis . For example , kinase CK2 - mediated phosphorylation of AP - 2 subunits (cid:1) - and (cid:2) 2 - adaptin reduces the interaction of AP - 2 with clathrin ( 4 , 5 ) , a process that is essential for the assem - bly of clathrin - coated vesicles . Similarly , phosphorylation of dynamin - 1 and synaptojanin - 1 has been reported to inhibit their binding to amphiphysin , whereas phosphorylation of amphiphysin inhibits its binding to AP - 2 and clathrin ( 6 ) . On the other hand , exposure of cells to protein - tyrosine kinase inhibitors profoundly attenuates ligand - induced internaliza - tion of receptors for EGF , B - cell antigen , and asialoglycoprotein and partially inhibits ligand - independent or constitutive endo - cytosis of the transferrin ( Tfn ) receptor ( 7 \u2013 9 ) . Although the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity associated with receptors for polypeptide growth factors such as EGF and insulin is known to be important for their endocytosis upon occupancy by ligands ( 1 ) , selective inhibition of non - receptor protein - tyrosine kinase Src also attenuates the internalization of c - Kit in hematopoietic cells ( 10 ) , neural cell adhesion molecule 1 in neuroblastoma cells ( 11 ) , andEGFreceptor ( 12 ) andconstitutiveinternalizationof Tfn induced by oxidative stress ( 13 ) and a splicing form of chole - cystokinin 2receptor ( 14 ) .

Cortactin , which contains a C - terminal SH3 domain and six and one - half 37 - amino acid repeats , is an Arp2 / 3 complex and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) - binding protein ( 15 \u2013 18 ) that is present in the cell periphery as well as in numerous cytoplasmic punctate structures ( 19 ) . Immunostaining with endosome markers or internalized ligands such as Tfn has established that many of these puncta represent endocytic vesicles ( 20 , 21 ) . Sup - pression of cortactin expression by either microinjection of cortactin antibody ( 21 ) or RNA - mediated interference ( 22 ) considerably impairs Tfn uptake in cells . Our recent in vitro analysis of Tfn sequestration using perforated cells demon - strates that depletion of cortactin in cytosol extracts weakens the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( 22 ) , indicating that cortactin is important for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Con - versely , depletion of cortactin in cells or overexpression of a cortactin SH3 fragment also reduces clathrin - independent endocytosis of (cid:3) c cytokine receptor ( 23 ) , indicating that cortac - tin may play a broad role in protein internalization . The mech - anism for cortactin - mediated endocytosis likely involves actin cytoskeleton reorganization as cortactin is known to promote the actin polymerization mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex ( 17 , 18 ) , which yields a cortical actin meshwork enriched at the leading edge of the cell as well as that associated with endocytic vesicles . In the de novo actin assembly , the major force pushing mem - brane protrusion , cortactin binds tightly to Arp2 / 3 complex at a nascent actin branching site , thereby generating a possible inward dynamic movement for an organelle that attaches to cortactin through its SH3 domain during the process of actin assembly ( 22 ) . Indeed , a major cortactin SH3 - binding protein has been found to be dynamin - 2 ( 24 ) . Importantly , binding of cortactin to dynamin - 2 is dependent upon actin polymeriza - tion itself , because it associates with dynamin - 2 maximally only during the process of actin assembly ( 22 ) . Therefore , coordina - tion and dynamic interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 may provide a mechanical force responsible for an actin assem - bly - driven movement of endocytic vesicles to the deep cytosol , which eventually leads to detachment of vesicles from a protru - sive membrane . Consistent with this notion , a recent analysis using alternating evanescent field and epifluorescence illumi - nation has shown that maximal invagination and scission of clathrin - coated pits coincides with recruitment of cortactin to the endocytic site ( 25 ) . Cortactin is also known to be a prominent substrate of Src protein - tyrosine kinase ( 19 , 26 ) , and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs frequently in response to various extracel - lular stimuli including growth factors ( 16 , 27 ) , bacterially medi - ated phagocytosis ( 28 ) , cell shrinkage ( 29 ) , and membrane injury ( 30 ) . Although previous studies have found that intro - duction of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphoryl - ation impairs cell motility , tumor invasion , invadopodia , and podosome formation ( 30 \u2013 33 ) , no solid evidence for a role of phosphorylated cortactin in actin polymerization either in cells ( 34 ) or in vitro 4 has been found . Therefore , the physiological role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation remains unknown . In this study we investigated a possible role of Src - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in receptor - mediated endocytosis . We found that deficiency in tyrosine phosphoryl - ation of cortactin attenuates Tfn uptake . Furthermore , we found that Src promotes the interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 . These findings indicate a role of tyrosine phospho - rylation of cortactin in the regulation of receptor - mediated endocytosis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Antibodies and Reagents \u2014Monoclonal cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc . ; poly - clonal cortactin antibody was prepared as described previously ( 16 ) ; human Tfn antibody was from ICN Biomedicals , Inc ; anti - biotin antibody and NHS - SS - biotin were from Pierce ; GFP antibody was either purchased from Molecular Probes or raised against recombinant His - GFP protein ; anti - Myc antibody ( 9E10 ) was from BD Biosciences ; polyclonal dynamin antibody was either obtained as a gift of Dr . McNiven ( Mayo Clinic ) or raised against the peptide CARDVLENKLLPLRRGYIGVVNR - SQKD ; and polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated cortactin was raised against a mixture of two phosphotyrosine ( pY ) - containing peptides : PSSPVpYEDAASFKC and pYESAE - APGHYPAEDSTpYDEYEC . DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins \u2014Plasmid encod - ing GFP - tagged full - length dynamin - 2 ( Dyn - GFP ) was a gift of Dr . McNiven . Plasmids encoding Myc - cortactin and Myc - Cort - F have been previously described ( 35 ) . His - tagged and tag - free cortactin proteins were prepared as described previ - ously ( 17 , 36 ) . To prepare GST - tagged dynamin - 2 ( GST - dy - namin - 2 ) and the proline - rich domain of dynamin - 2 ( GST - dy - namin - 2 - PRD ) , DNA fragments were generated by PCR using GFP - dynamin - 2 as the template and subcloned into pGEX - 4T - 2 plasmid . The resulting plasmids were transformed into bac - terial BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIPL ( Stratagene ) cells for protein expression . The primers used in PCR were as follows : 5 (cid:1) - GTT - CTTGAATTCCCATGGGCAACCGCGGGATGGA - 3 (cid:1) and 5 (cid:1) - ATTATTGCGGCCGCCTAGTCGAGCAGGGACGGCTC - 3 (cid:1) for full - length dynamin - 2 ; and 5 (cid:1) - TTACCGGTCGCCACCA - TGGTGAGC and 5 (cid:1) - TATGCGGCCGCCTAGTCGAGCAG - GGACGGCTCGG - 3 (cid:1) for PRD of dynamin - 2 . Cell Culture , DNA Transfection , and Immunoprecipitation \u2014 HeLa , MDA - MB - 231 , and HEK - 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum . 3T3 - L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modi - fied Eagle\u2019s medium containing 10 % calf serum . To analyze the effect of pervanadate ( PV ) on the interaction between cortactin and dynamin , HEK - 293 cells were tran - siently co - transfected with Dyn - GFP and Myc - cortactin , or Myc - Cort - F . After 24 h , cells were incubated in a serum - free medium for an additional 24 h . Cells were then treated with PV ( 100 (cid:4) m Na 3 VO 4 and 4 m M H 2 O 2 ) for 30 min and lysed in a lysis buffer ( 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 10 m M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 m M EDTA , 1 m M Na 3 VO 4 , 1 m M sodium molybdate , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and Roche protease inhibitor mixture tablets ) .

Analysis of the Effect of Tyrosine Phosphorylation on the Affin - ity of Cortactin for Dynamin - 2 \u2014Cortactin was phosphorylated by Src kinase ( Upstate ) in a reaction buffer containing 100 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 125 m M MgCl 2 , 25 m M MnCl 2 , 2 m M EGTA , 1 m M ATP , and 0 . 2 m M Na 3 VO 4 at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min , the modified condition recommended by the manufacture . To analyze the affinity of cortactin for dynamin , 18 pmol of cortactin , either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated , was incubated with dif - ferent amounts of GST - dynamin - 2 immobilized on glutathi - one - Sepharose in buffer ( 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 10 m M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M Na 3 VO 4 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and 1 m M dithiothre - itol ) . After incubation of the mixture for 2 h , samples were centrifuged at 800 (cid:2) g for 10 s , and aliquots of the supernatants were fractionated by 10 % SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblot using cortactin antibody . Cortactin on the blot was detected by Kodak Image Station 2000R and quantified as the percentage of depletion . The resulting data were used to fit a rectangular hyperbola using Sigma Plots 8 . 0 , yielding values of the equilib - rium dissociation constants ( K d ) . Capture Enzyme - linked Immunosorbent Assay \u2014Cells expressing cortactin - GFP or Cort - F - GFP were incubated in serum - free Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 1 % bovine serum albumin and 20 m M HEPES at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and incubated with 10 (cid:4) g / ml bio - Tfn for 30 min on ice . Endo - cytosis was initiated by incubating the mixture at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min and terminated by placing on ice . To measure internaliza - tion of bio - Tfn , total cell lysates were added to a 96 - well ELISA ( enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ) plate coated with an anti - Tfn antibody . After 12 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C , each well was added with streptavidin - horseradish peroxidase and Roche BM blue substrate , respectively . Absorption at 450 nm was determined by a microplate reader ( Anthos Labtec ) and was plotted as a function of time . Cell - free Assay for CCV Formation \u2014The cell - free internal - ization assay with perforated 3T3 - L1 cells was performed according to the method as described ( 38 ) . 3T3 - L1 cells were subjected to permeabilization by submersion in liquid nitrogen and rapid thawing at 37 \u00b0C . The cells were then scraped from culture dishes , washed in KSHM buffer ( 100 m M potassium acetate , 85 m M sucrose , 1 m M magnesium acetate , and 20 m M HEPES - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 ) , and centrifuged at 800 (cid:2) g for 3 min . The permeabilized cells were then incubated with 8 (cid:4) g / ml B - SS - Tfn in KSHM buffer containing 0 . 8 % bovine serum albu - min for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C . The cell suspension ( 10 (cid:4) l ) was mixed with 300 (cid:4) g of brain cytosol and an ATP - generating system in a final volume of 40 (cid:4) l . Biotin - SS - Tfn internalization was initi - ated by incubating the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min and stopped by returning them to ice . After incubation the reaction was washed with 500 (cid:4) l of ice - cold KSHM buffer and spun at 10 , 000 (cid:2) g . Cell pellet was then subjected to MesNa resistance assay as described previously ( 22 ) . RNA Interference Assay \u2014Human cortactin small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) were prepared by an in vitro transcription pro - cedure using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufac - ture\u2019s protocol of Silencer siRNA construction kit ( Ambion ) . The target sequence is 5 (cid:1) - AAGUUUGGUGUCCAGAUG - GAC - 3 (cid:1) . The control siRNA against human HS1 targets 5 (cid:1) - GACAUCCUCAAGAAGAAGGAG - 3 (cid:1) . Treatment of cells with siRNAs was described previously ( 22 ) . RESULTS We previously identified residues Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 , and Tyr - 482 of cortactin as the primary sites targeted by Src ( 35 ) . To study the role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in receptor - mediated endocytosis , HeLa cells were infected with a retroviral vector , MGIN ( 39 ) , encoding a murine cor - tactin construct tagged by GFP at the C terminus ( cortactin - GFP ) , a mutant of Y421F / Y466F / Y482F ( Cort - F - GFP ) , and a mutation with deletion of the SH3 domain ( Cort (cid:3) SH3 - GFP ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . The expression level of cortactin GFP fusions in infected cell populations was comparable with that of endog - enous cortactin as determined by immunoblot ( Fig . 1 B ) . The infected cells were exposed to biotin - Tfn on ice , and inter - nalization of biotin - Tfn was analyzed at 5 min after shifting to 37 \u00b0C . As shown in Fig . 1 C , the cells expressing cortactin - GFP internalized Tfn at an efficiency similar to the cells infected with the viral GFP vector , indicating no significant effect of overexpression of wild - type cortactin on endocytosis . However , Tfn uptake in the cells expressing Cort - F - GFP was nearly 40 % less than in cells expressing the vector alone ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 1 C ) . Similarly , cells overexpressing Cort (cid:3) SH3 - GFP showed an impaired Tfn uptake at an efficiency 43 % less than the control cells . To examine the role of Src activity in Tfn uptake , cells were also treated with PP2 , a selective inhibitor of Src ( 40 ) , prior to Tfn uptake analysis . PP2 treat - ment inhibited Tfn uptake by (cid:5) 60 % ( p (cid:4) 0 . 005 ) , an extent similar to a previous report using genistein , a pan - tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( 7 ) . In contrast , PP2 treatment of cells expressing Cort - F - GFP resulted in only 30 % inhibition of Tfn uptake ( p (cid:6) 0 . 3 ) . The role of cortactin phosphorylation was further ana - lyzed with a cell - free system in which Tfn linked with biotin through a cleavable disulfide bond ( B - SS - Tfn ) was applied to perforated 3T3 - L1 cells ( 22 ) . Under these conditions , sequestration of Tfn into deeply invaginated coated pits and internalization of coated vesicles are able to be reconstituted by incubation with exogenous cytosol ( 38 , 41 \u2013 43 ) . B - SS - Tfn internalized into coated pits becomes resistant to MesNa - mediated cleavage of B - SS - Tfn , a property that can be used indirectly to measure the CCV formation . To analyze the activity of cortactin and its variants to rescue CCV formation in the absence of cortactin , rat brain extract devoid of cor - tactin was prepared by absorption using cortactin antibody - conjugated beads followed by precipitation , a process that effectively removed most of the cortactin but not the dynamin - 2 or actin in the extract ( Fig . 1 D ) . The cortactin - depleted brain extract was then used to reconstitute Tfn endocytosis in perforated 3T3 - L1 cells . As shown in Fig . 1 E , cortactin - depleted extract ( del - Cort ) showed impaired CCV formation ( 60 % less than the mock - treated extract ) , a result that is similar to what we had reported previously ( 22 ) . The addition of recombinant wild - type cortactin considerably restored the CCV formation by nearly 80 % . In contrast , add - ing recombinant Cort - F rescued less than 50 % of the CCV Phosphorylation of Cortactin 16088 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282\u2022NUMBER 22\u2022 JUNE 1 , 2007 formation , which is statistically lower than that of wild - type cortactin ( p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) , indicating that tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of cortactin is required for a maximal assembly of coated vesicles , an essential step in the early stage of endocytosis . To further establish the role of cortactin tyrosine phospho - rylation in endocytosis within cells , expression of endogenous cortactin of human breast tumor cells ( MDA - MB - 231 ) infected by retroviruses carrying different types of murine cortactin mutants was silenced by siRNA targeting of human cortactin mRNA . As a control , virus - infected MDA - MB - 231 cells were also treated with siRNA against HS1 , a cortactin - related gene that is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells . As shown in Fig . 2 A , the human cortactin siRNA inhibited cortactin expres - sion by (cid:5) 60 \u2013 80 % as compared with that of the cells treated with the HS1 siRNA . When biotin - Tfn uptake was analyzed , a nearly 70 % reduction in endocytosis was found in the cells treated with cor - tactin siRNA ( Fig . 2 B , left ) , which is consistent with our previous report ( 22 ) and a report from oth - ers ( 23 ) . To determine whether the decrease in Tfn endocytosis was due to the specific loss of cortactin in the siRNA - treated cells , we treated the cells expressing murine cortactin - GFP with HS1 and cortac - tin siRNAs , respectively . In addition to the endogenous cortactin , the human cortactin siRNA also showed a slight inhibition of the exogenous murine cortactin ( Fig . 2 B , right ) , presumably because of the 95 % identity between human and mouse mRNAs in the region targeted by the siRNA . Neverthe - less , the overall level of exogenous cortactin proteins was greater than or similar to that of the endogenous cortactin of the control cells . At this level cortactin siRNA failed to inhibit Tfn uptake in the cortactin - GFP - expressing cells , indicating that cortactin - GFP protein main - tains its endocytic function similar to the endogenous cortactin . How - ever , the same cortactin siRNA retained inhibitory activity for Tfn uptake in the cells expressing either mutant Cort - F - GFP or Cort (cid:3) SH3 - GFP ( Fig . 2 B ) . The above data confirm that tyro - sine phosphorylation of cortactin and the function of the SH3 domain are implicated in endocytosis . Because the SH3 domain is also implicated in binding to dynamin , we were prompted to examine a possible role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of the interaction of cortactin with dynamin - 2 . Recombinant cor - tactin was phosphorylated by Src in vitro for 30 min , the con - dition under which a maximal phosphorylation was achieved ( Fig . 3 A , data not shown ) . Under the same condition no appar - ent phosphorylation of Cort - F was observed ( Fig . 3 A ) , consist - ent with our previous finding that residues Tyr - 421 , Tyr - 466 , and Tyr - 482 are the primary targets of Src ( 35 ) . The interaction of phosphorylated cortactin with dynamin was analyzed by pulling down Src - treated cortactin proteins with GST - dy - namin - 2 . As shown in Fig . 3 B , GST - dynamin - 2 pulled down more Src - treated cortactin than the nonphosphorylated form . On the other hand , the same peptide precipitated little Cort - F regardless of Src treatment . The pulldown analysis was also FIGURE 1 .

Phosphorylation of Cortactin JUNE 1 , 2007\u2022 VOLUME 282\u2022NUMBER 22 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 16089 used to quantify the binding affinity for GST - dynamin - 2 by measuring depletion of cortactin proteins in the supernatants after GST - dynamin - 2 pulldown ( Fig . 3 C ) . This analysis demon - strates that the affinity of phosphorylated cortactin for GST - dynamin - 2 is (cid:5) 3 . 5 - fold higher than nonphosphorylated form ( K d (cid:6) 765 n M versus K d (cid:6) 211 n M ) . On the other hand , Cort - F has a much lower affinity for GST - dynamin - 2 ( K d (cid:6) 2 . 3 (cid:4) M ) , and this affinity was not significantly changed upon Src treat - ment ( K d (cid:6) 2 . 3 (cid:4) m versus K d (cid:6) 2 . 2 (cid:4) m ) ( Fig . 3 D ) . The SH3 domain of cortactin is known to bind to the PRD of dynamin ( 24 ) . To examine whether the binding to the PRD was also subjected to Src - mediated regulation , GST - tagged dynamin - 2 PRD peptide ( GST - dynamin - 2 - PRD ) was used to pull down cortactin . Like GST - dynamin - 2 , GST - dynamin - 2 - PRD precipitated more Src - treated wild - type cortactin pro - teins than Cort - F proteins ( Fig . 3 E ) . Therefore , we conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation promotes the interaction between the SH3 domain of cortactin and PRD of dynamin - 2 . We also evaluated the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on the interaction of cortactin and dynamin - 2 in cells . This was done using HEK - 293 cells co - expressing GFP - tagged dynamin - 2 at the N terminus ( GFP - dynamin - 2 ) and Myc - tagged cortactin ( Myc - cortactin ) or Myc - Cort - F ( Fig . 4 A ) . Both Myc - cortactin and Myc - Cort - F were expressed as a duplet around 80 \u2013 90 kDa , the characteristic behavior of cor - tactin in SDS - PAGE . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the cells was induced by exposing the cells to PV ( Fig . 4 B ) . Consist - ent with Src treatment in vitro , PV was unable to induce phosphoryl - ation of Myc - Cort - F ( Fig . 4 B ) . The interaction between exogenous cortactin and dynamin - 2 was ana - lyzed by immunoprecipitation . Although GFP antibody precipi - tated GFP - dynamin - 2 equally in cells expressing either Myc - cor - tactin or Myc - Cort - F ( Fig . 4 C ) , considerable coprecipitation of Myc - cortactin and GFP - dynamin - 2 was only observed in the cells upon treatment with PV . In contrast , Myc - Cort - F was barely detected in the pellet of cells treated with and without PV . It is known that dynamin - 2 is also a substrate of Src , and phos - phorylation of dynamin - 2 has been implicated in ligand - depend - ent receptor - mediated endocyto - sis ( 44 ) . Therefore , the apparent increased interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 upon PV treatment could be because of phosphorylation of dynamin - 2 . However , PV treatment triggered little phosphorylation of GFP - dynamin - 2 under conditions in which cortactin - GFP was significantly phosphorylated ( Fig . 5 A ) . We next examined the interaction between Src - treated GST - dynamin - 2 and cortactin in vitro . Although Src was able to induce marked phosphorylation of GST - dy - namin - 2 in vitro ( Fig . 5 B ) , phosphorylated GST - dynamin - 2 did not apparently show an increase in binding to His - cor - tactin ( Fig . 5 C ) . Therefore , Src exerts its effect mainly through phosphorylation of cortactin rather than dynamin - 2 . DISCUSSION In this study , we have provided several lines of evidence showing that Src - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin is implicated in optimal clathrin dependent endocytosis . First , overexpression of a cortactin mutant , Cort - F , which lacks three tyrosine residues targeted by Src , reduced clathrin - mediated Tfn uptake by (cid:5) 40 % . Second , recombinant Cort - F protein was unable to rescue effectively impaired CCV formation in a cor - tactin - depleted brain extract . The inability to rescue the CCV formation was unlikely due to an inappropriate structural fold - ing associated with Cort - F , as the mutant shows a gel motility similar to the wild - type ( Fig . 1 A ) , binds to Arp2 / 3 complex , and promotes Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( data not shown ) . Moreover , Cort - F also failed to restore internalization of Tfn in the cell wherein cortactin expression was suppressed using siRNA . Third , treatment with a Src selective inhibitor FIGURE2 .

Phosphorylation of Cortactin 16090 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282\u2022NUMBER 22\u2022 JUNE 1 , 2007 decreased Tfn uptake by 60 % . PP2 or its analogs have been used previously in examining the role of Src kinases in endocytosis of different types of receptors and revealed moderate , sometime even controversial , results ( 13 , 46 , 47 ) . These differences may be due to variations in cell types , the presence of other types of kinases , and the conditions used in these studies . Because non - phosphorylated cortactin has a low but noticeable affinity for dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 3 D ) , this low activity could provide an alter - native explanation for the moderate effect of Src kinase inhibitors in these studies . Finally , interaction between cor - tactin and dynamin - 2 was significantly enhanced upon PV treatment , a chemical mixture that provokes tyrosine phos - phorylation of cortactin ( Fig . 4 ) . However , vanadate , a main component in PV , has an inhibitory activity to actomyosin - ATPase ( 48 ) . Although no ATPase has been found to associ - ate with either dynamin or cortactin , we have previously observed the complex of cortactin with actin and myosin in cells ( 49 ) . Therefore , PV may also indirectly affect the inter - action between dynamin and cortactin through the regula - tion of myosin . Further experiments are required to verify this possibility . Tfn receptor uptake is known to be a constitutive process and independent of ligand occupancy ( 50 ) . Therefore , our data indi - cate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin plays a general role in constitutive internalization . Unlike many growth factor receptors such as that for EGF , which contains an intrinsic tyro - sine kinase activity and triggers tyrosine phosphorylation upon ligand binding , Tfn receptor does not contain any kinase activ - ity . However , an earlier study had shown that exposing cells to genistein , a pan - tyrosine kinase inhibitor , reduced Tfn inter - nalization by nearly 50 % ( 7 ) , although the same treatment com - pletely abolished EGF receptor endocytosis . This suggests that the pathway for Tfn receptor uptake is less dependent upon tyrosine kinase activity than that for EGF receptor . Although ligand - dependent endocytosis may utilize a different subpopu - lation of endocytosis machinery ( 7 ) , evidence for such distinct endocytic apparatus remains to be found . On the other hand , it has been well described that EGF receptor and Tfn receptor share a common endocytic pathway involving CCV assembly . It is interesting to note that (cid:4) 2 kinase modulates the affinity of AP - 2 for the sorting motif on Tfn receptor ( 51 ) and Src regu - lates constitutive internalization of cholecystokinin 2 receptor ( 14 ) . Therefore , our data support the view that the assembly of the components for the constitutive endocytosis is a regulated process involving both serine / threonine and tyrosine kinases . Although the physiological role of tyrosine kinases in constitu - tive endocytosis is unclear , it is apparent that EGF receptor - mediated endocytosis , which occurs only under certain physi - FIGURE 3 .

Phosphorylation of Cortactin JUNE 1 , 2007\u2022 VOLUME 282\u2022NUMBER 22 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 16091 ological conditions suitable for epithelial cell proliferation , may require a specific cellular process allowing the endocytic machinery to operate at a maximal level and to ensure a rapid attenuation of EGF signaling ( 52 ) . In contrast , rapid down - reg - ulation of Tfn receptor , which brings an essential blood nutri - ent to most types of mammalian cells , may likely cause harm to cell homeostasis . In fact , internalization of Tfn receptor has evolved to a pathway that is not subject to the limitation imposed by ligand saturation . This property may make the dependence of Tfn receptor internalization on tyrosine phos - phorylation less apparent under regular culture conditions . The physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation - regulated constitutive endocytosis may be more evident under other conditions such as allowing synchronization of Tfn receptor recycling . Our data showing that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin modulates the interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 provide a plausible mechanism for the regulation of endocyto - sis through phosphorylation . Because of the dynamic nature of cortactin - mediated actin polymerization and possible on - and - off of cortactin phosphorylation in cells , our finding is consist - ent with the dynamics of endocytic vesicles , including invagi - nation , splitting from large vesicles , and merging and lateral movements , in which the important role of actin polymeriza - tion has been indicated ( 53 , 54 ) . Dynamin - 2 has been reported as a substrate of Src as well ( 55 ) . Therefore , it is possible that phosphorylation of dynamin - 2 by Src could also play a role in the regulation of the interaction of dynamin and cortactin . Yet , PV treatment , which triggers Src activity , does not provoke a significant increase in phosphorylation of ectopically expressed dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 5 A ) . In vitro , Src is able to phosphorylate dynamin - 2 . However , phosphorylated dynamin - 2 does not show any apparent change in its affinity for cortactin ( Fig . 5 B ) . Furthermore , a peptide encoding the dynamin PRD alone binds to cortactin at a lower affinity compared with phosphorylated cortactin . Thus , it is unlikely that phosphorylation of dynamin would be a major mechanism responsible for Src regulated Tfn endocytosis . This result is also consistent with previous reports that mutations at the phosphorylation sites of Tyr - 597 and Tyr - 599 in dynamin do not cause signif - icant reduction of Tfn uptake ( 56 ) , although the same phosphorylation site appears to be necessary for EGF internalization and may regulate its assembly and GTPase activity ( 44 ) . The mechanism by which tyro - sine phosphorylation regulates the interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 remains to be defined . We speculate that tyrosine phos - phorylation triggers a change in the configuration of the cortactin SH3 domain . One possibility is that the SH3 domain may be masked by either an intra - or intermolecular interaction . It is also possible that the full activity of the SH3 domain requires a specific configuration necessary for its targets . Such con - figuration may be stabilized by tyro - sine phosphorylation .

A recent report that a cortactin mutant with mutations at tyrosine phosphoryl - ation sites and the SH3 domain is able to restore invadopodia formation in cortactin knockdown cells further implies a func - tional relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and the SH3 domain ( 33 ) . Characterization of the details of the cortac - tin configurational change will be essential to resolve this issue . It is interesting to note that the interaction between cortactin and dynamin - 2 is also regulated by actin polymerization ( 22 ) . Thus , actin polymerization and tyrosine phosphorylation may act in concert in the regulation of endocytosis by modulating the interaction between cortactin and dynamin . Under normal physiological conditions the coordination between actin polymerization and Src may increase the dynamics of receptor - mediated endocytosis . However , it remains to be determined whether hyperphosphorylation of cortactin , such as that occur - ring in the Src - transforming cells , could contribute to enhanced endocytosis . Alternatively , the intensive interaction between hyperphosphorylated cortactin and dynamin may trigger the formation of a type of membrane remodeling that favors oncogenic behavior of cells other than endocytosis . Indeed , dynamin - 2 has been detected in podosomes of trans - formed fibroblasts and osteoclasts where phosphorylated cor - tactin and activated Src are often present ( 45 ) .

Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) have ultimate differentiation capacity and exceptionally low - strength ECM contact , yet the organization and function of adhesion sites and associated actin cytoskeleton remain poorly de\ufb01ned . We imaged hPSCs at the cell - ECM interface with total internal re\ufb02ection \ufb02uorescence microscopy and discovered that adhesions at the colony edge were exceptionally large and connected by thick ventral stress \ufb01bers . The actin fence encircling the colony was found to exert extensive Rho - ROCK - myosin - dependent mechanical stress to enforce colony morphology , compaction , and pluripotency and to de\ufb01ne mitotic spindle orientation . Remarkably , differentiation altered adhesion organization and signaling characterized by a switch from ventral to dorsal stress \ufb01bers , reduced mechanical stress , and increased integrin activity and cell - ECM adhesion strength . Thus , pluripotency ap - pears to be linked to unique colony organization and adhesion structure . INTRODUCTION Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are multifaceted organelles that link the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to the cell\u2019s contractile actin cytoskeleton to determine adhesion strength and mecha - nosensing and to regulate cell polarity , survival , and mitosis ( Tseng et al . , 2012 ) . The contribution of mechano - transduction and cell contractility to developmental pro - cesses is evident in vivo ( Wozniak and Chen , 2009 ) . In addition , recent studies have demonstrated the importance of ECM stiffness in pluripotent stem cell ( PSC ) speci\ufb01cation ( Chowdhury et al . , 2010 ; Przybyla et al . , 2016b ) and the sig - ni\ufb01cance of Rho - ROCK - myosin signaling in human PSC ( hPSC ) maintenance ( Ohgushi and Sasai , 2011 ) , high - lighting the crucial role of the contractile actin cytoskel - eton in stem cell biology . However , the organization and signi\ufb01cance of FAs , the cell\u2019s mechanotransducing units , and their actin linkage have remained unstudied in hPSC colonies . In the pluripotent state , stem cells adopt tight colony morphology with low adhesive strength ( Singh et al . , 2013 ) , in stark contrast to the parental somatic cells ( e . g . , \ufb01broblasts ) used to generate induced PSCs ( iPSCs ) . Thus , substantial remodeling of cell adhesions is a prerequisite for reprogramming and , accordingly , cell - ECM interactions represent a barrier toward reprogramming ( Qin et al . , 2014 ) . In culture , hiPSC survival and pluripotency requires appropriate adhesion to ECM ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) , suggest - ing that integrin - mediated FAs play an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency in vitro . RESULTS Large FAs and a Prominent Actin Fence Encircle Pluripotent Colonies Parental \ufb01broblasts , used for the reprogramming of the hiPSC lines , demonstrated 5 - to 10 - fold more robust adhe - sion to Matrigel ( MG ) , vitronectin ( VTN ) , and laminins ( LM - 521 , LM - 511 ) compared with hiPSCs ( Figure S1A ) , prompting us to examine further the FAs and cytoskeletal network within these two cell types . We plated parental \ufb01broblasts and hiPSCs on VTN and imaged cell - ECM contacts 24 hr post attachment , within 100 \u2013 200 nm of the matrix interface , using high - resolution total internal re\ufb02ection \ufb02uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . To assess FAs across the entire colony without compromising resolution , we focused our attention on relatively small hiPSC colonies ( 1 \u2013 35 cells ) . As expected , FAs in hiPSCs were remarkably different from the parental \ufb01broblasts . Surprisingly , hiPSCs displayed large , PAXILLIN - positive FAs at the edges of the colonies ( \u2018\u2018cornerstone\u2019\u2019 FAs ) in stark contrast to the smaller and more uniformly distributed FAs in the strongly adherent parental \ufb01broblasts ( Figure 1A ) . In addition , while the parental \ufb01broblasts displayed multiple thin actin stress \ufb01bers aligned predominantly along the long axis of the cell and connected to FAs at their distal ends , akin to dorsal stress \ufb01bers ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) , hiPSC colonies ex - hibited thick actin stress \ufb01bers parallel to the colony edge and anchored to FAs at both ends , in accordance with features of ventral stress \ufb01bers ( VSFs ) ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) . This phenotypic difference was apparent in hiPSCs Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 9 j 67 \u2013 76 j July 11 , 2017 j \u00aa 2017 The Authors . 67 This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) .

Data are from more than three biologically independent experiments . Scale bars , 10 m m . See also Figure S1 . 68 Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 9 j 67 \u2013 76 j July 11 , 2017 cultured on VTN , LM - 521 , and MG , and in human embry - onic stem cells ( hESCs ) ( Figure S1B ) . E - cadherin - dependent cell - cell adhesions are also important for pluripotency , sur - vival , and colony formation of hESCs ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Inter - estingly , E - CADHERIN was concentrated in close proximity to the cell - ECM interface in between the VSFs at the col - ony edge ( Figure 1B ) , suggesting that cell - cell junctions contribute to the actin fence integrity alongside FAs . HiPSC FAs appeared to be functional signaling plat - forms positive for focal adhesion kinase pFAK ( Y397 ) and pPAXILLIN ( Y118 ) ( Figures 1C and S1C ) , suggesting a role beyond simple anchorage for these adhesions in maintain - ing hiPSC cultures ( Mitra and Schlaepfer , 2006 ) . FAs located at the hiPSC colony edge had a larger characteristic area ( 4 . 2 m m 2 ) , coverage ( 12 . 3 % ) , and density ( 0 . 022 / m m 2 ) , compared with FAs visible in the center of the colonies ( 1 . 9 m m 2 , 3 % , 0 . 017 / m m 2 ) or FAs in parental \ufb01broblasts ( 1 . 7 m m 2 , 2 . 5 % , 0 . 012 / m m 2 ) ( Figures 1D and S1D ) . Further analysis revealed that in small colonies consisting of % 10 cells large FAs were most predominant ; however , the den - sity and number of FAs remained distinct between the edge and the center irrespective of colony size ( Figure S1E ) . Although the presence of large FAs in weakly adhering hPSC colonies is counterintuitive , these results imply that hPSC - ECM interactions may be predominately mediated by the colony edge . Interestingly , characteristic FAs and the actin fence appeared to assemble rapidly and to be sub - sequently stable , as 2 hr post colony fragmentation and re - plating these features were already prominent ( Figure S2A ) . The FAs grew in size after plating for up to 20 hr , whereas the number of FAs remained relatively constant ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . Cytoskeletal Mechanical Stress Depends on the Angle of Ventral Stress Fibers VSFs are contractile actin bundles ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) , and accordingly we observed MYOSIN IIA and phosphorylated myosin light chain ( pMLC ) co - localization with the thick actin \ufb01bers at the hiPSC colony edge ( Fig - ures 2A and 2B ) . In addition , the actin bundling protein a - ACTININ demonstrated clear overlap with actin \ufb01bers and the FAs ( Figure 2C ) , further con\ufb01rming these actin structures to be VSFs . VSF contraction is known to impact on FA size , composi - tion , and overall cell adhesion ( Katoh et al . , 2011 ) . Remark - ably , hPSC colony organization and FA size , observed in cells plated on glass / polystyrene , were not signi\ufb01cantly altered on 30 - or 10 - kPa VTN - functionalized hydrogels , and only modestly reduced on 3 kPa . However , reduced stiffness did correlate with gradual decrease in FA number ( Figure S2D ) . Using traction force microscopy ( TFM ) , we assessed the traction stress applied by individual hPSC colonies . We selected 10 - kPa rigidity to achieve optimal balance between retained colony morphology and suf\ufb01 - cient compliancy for detecting cell - ECM force mediated bead displacement . hPSCs were found to exert strong inward - directed mechanical forces on the ECM at speci\ufb01c locations coinciding with VSFs at the colony edge ( Fig - ure 2D ) . These data imply a role for the VSF actin fence in tight packaging of hPSC colonies . Accordingly , increasing cell numbers correlated with signi\ufb01cantly smaller individ - ual cell area and higher overall cell density within colonies ( Figure S2E ) . In addition , hiPSCs had , on average , 34 FAs per cell compared with 66 in \ufb01broblasts . Therefore , high compaction results in decreased ECM contact area and reduced FA number per cell , possibly explaining the overall weak adhesion of hiPSC colonies . Interestingly , small hiPSC colonies with acute inter - \ufb01ber angles exerted signi\ufb01cantly higher stress on the ECM per cell than larger colonies where VSFs were aligned linearly one after another and the opposing mechanical stress of adjacent FAs appeared to counteract each other ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . In single hiPSCs , VSFs had the sharpest angles and formed a triangular - shaped fence around the cell . In two - cell clusters , the inter - \ufb01ber angles were increased to 90 (cid:2) ( Figure 2F ) . This pattern of VSF organization suggests that single stem cells experience the highest mechanical stress , and that upon expansion colonies adopt a rounder morphology to accommodate wider inter - \ufb01ber angles and ultimately reduce the mechanical stress exerted by individ - ual cells at the colony edge . These results may begin to explain why cellular tension and actomyosin contractility , while important for hESC colony survival and proliferation ( Harb et al . , 2008 ; Ohgushi et al . , 2015 ) , are lethal to single dissociated hESCs ( Ohgushi and Sasai , 2011 ) . Rho Signaling Controls Cornerstone FAs Inhibition of actomyosin contraction triggers disassembly of stress \ufb01bers and mature FAs ( Katoh et al . , 2011 ) . Accord - ingly , blebbistatin ( myosin heavy chain ATPase inhibitor ) , Y - 27632 ( Rho kinase inhibitor ; ROCKi ) treatment , or cyto - chalasin - D - mediated ablation of the actin cytoskeleton triggered disassembly of actin and actin - associated FAs in hiPSC colonies ( Figures 3A and S3A ) . Furthermore , ablation of FAs with a short exposure to CDK1 inhibitor RO - 3306 ( Robertson et al . , 2015 ) led to rapid loss of large FAs and the colony - encircling actin fence ( Figure S3B ) . These \ufb01nd - ings validate that actomyosin contractility and cornerstone FAs are indispensable for the formation of the VSF actin fence . Intact VSFs and FAs also appeared to be essential for colony morphology and compaction , as blebbistatin and ROCKi treatments triggered loss of the typical plu - ripotency - associated sharp - edge colony morphology and reduced cell density ( Figure 3B ) . In addition , blebbistatin , ROCKi , or RO - 3306 treatment resulted in expansion of Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 9 j 67 \u2013 76 j July 11 , 2017 69 Figure 2 .

Contractile Actin Fence and Large FAs Reinforce Pluripotency Next , we studied the inter - relationship between the actin fence and pluripotency using a SOX2 - td - Tomato reporter hiPSC line . Following ROCKi exposure 3 days after plating , SOX2 expression , although positive in all cells , was signi\ufb01cantly reduced compared with control ( Figure 3E ) . Levels of the pluripotency linked marker SSEA - 5 were also decreased , but these data did not reach signi\ufb01cance . Conversely , expression of the SSEA - 1 differentiation marker was induced in the presence of ROCKi . Thus , ROCKi affects pluripotency , indicating a role for the actin fence and large FAs in force - dependent regulation of the core pluripotency network . Colony Morphology Is Maintained by Edge - Oriented Cell Division Time - lapse imaging demonstrated that during colony expansion mitosis occurred throughout the colony ( Movie S1 ) . However , at the colony periphery mitotic spindles were predominantly ( 83 % ) aligned parallel ( 0 (cid:2) \u2013 30 (cid:2) ) to the VSFs , compared with a more random orientation in the colony center . The parallel positioning was dependent on an intact contractile actomyosin border as treatment with blebbistatin triggered random mitotic spindle orienta - tion throughout the colony ( Figure 3F ) . These data suggest that daughter cells located on the colony edge retain their localization and assemble prominent FAs and actin bun - dles to reform the tight edge upon colony expansion . FAs of hiPSCs Display High SRC Activity Integrins play important roles in mechanosensing ( Athe - rton et al . , 2016 ) . The main integrin subunits expressed at the protein level in hPSCs are a 3 , a 5 , a 6 , a v , b 1 , and b 5 ( Meng et al . , 2010 ; Rowland et al . , 2010 ; Vuoristo et al . , 2009 ; Xu et al . , 2001 ) . Notably , we detected prominent a v b 5 integrin staining at FAs associated with VSFs ( Fig - ure 3G ) and b 1 integrin at the periphery of the colonies ( Figure 3H ) , implicating these integrins in cornerstone FA signaling . Interestingly , in hiPSC colonies the expression of FA signaling proteins appeared to be distinct from parental \ufb01broblasts ( Figures 3I and S3D ) . Levels of a major force - related FA protein VINCULIN ( Atherton et al . , 2016 ) were slightly higher in hiPSCs , whereas PAXILLIN levels were reduced . Total FAK levels were elevated but the pool of pFAK remained unchanged , indicating proportionally lower FAK activity in hiPSCs . In contrast , both SRC expres - sion and active pSRC ( Y416 ) were signi\ufb01cantly elevated in hiPSCs . Furthermore , pSRC was highly abundant in hiPSC and nearly absent in \ufb01broblast FAs ( Figure 3J ) . As Rho signaling can direct SRC to FAs at stress \ufb01ber termini ( Timp - son et al . , 2001 ) , this could account for the strong pSRC localization observed in hiPSC FAs . FAK and SRC , in particular , have been implicated in Rho signaling from FAs ( Huveneers and Danen , 2009 ; Schiller and Fa\u00a8ssler , 2013 ) and in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival in different cell types ( Mitra and Schlaepfer , 2006 ) . FAK inhibition disrupted hiPSC colony morphology and induced cell detachment within a few hours ( Fig - ure S3E and Movie S2 ) . Similarly , PP2 - mediated inhibition of SRC family kinases triggered cell detachment originating from the periphery of the colonies ( Figures S3F and S3G ; Movie S3 ) . Thus , both FAK and SRC signaling appear to be essential for hiPSCs . Pluripotency - Associated VSFs and Large FAs Are Lost in Differentiation Retinoic acid ( RA ) - driven differentiation , veri\ufb01ed by loss of pluripotency markers SOX2 , NANOG , and SSEA - 3 and in - duction of differentiation marker SSEA - 1 ( Figures S4A and S4B ) , resulted in the loss of typical colony morphology ( Fig - ure S4C ) and pluripotency - associated VSFs , and prompted Figure 3 .

In addition , differentia - tion was accompanied by a striking reduction in FA size ( Figure 4B ) , further validating that large FAs correlate with pluripotency . The differentiation - associated switch in actin and FA or - ganization was accompanied by signi\ufb01cantly enhanced cell ECM adhesion ( Figure 4C ) . In addition , altered stress \ufb01ber alignment correlated with colony \ufb02attening and increased cell - surface area ( Figure S4F ) , which was not due to an increase in cell size ( Figure S4G ) , and resulted in a markedlossofcolonycompaction ( FigureS4H ) . Inconjunc - tion with the cytoskeletal changes , differentiation triggered asubstantiallossinmechanicalstressexertedbycellsonthe ECM and a uniform distribution of forces across the colony ( Figure 4D ) in contrast to spatially restricted mechanical forces observed in pluripotent colonies ( Figure 2D ) . In line with reducedFAsizeandmechanical stress , we notedsignif - icant downregulation of adhesion signaling , in the form of reduced pSRC , in differentiated cells ( Figures 4E and S4I ) . Insomaticcells , adhesiontotheECMiscontrolledbyregu - lation of integrin activity ( Bouvard et al . , 2013 ) . In hPSC , b 1 integrin is essential for supporting colony interactions with various ECMs ( Braam et al . , 2008 ; Prowse et al . , 2010 ; Row - land et al . , 2010 ; Vuoristo et al . , 2009 ) . We found that active b 1 integrin expression ( detected with 12G10 , an activation state - speci\ufb01c antibody ) , primarily restricted to cornerstone FAs in hPSC colonies , was signi\ufb01cantly lower in hiPSCs than in parental \ufb01broblasts . Differentiation increased b 1 in - tegrin activity at FAs and at the cell surface ( Figures 4F , 4G , S4J , and S4K ) in accordance with increased cell adhesion , suggestingthat tight control overintegrinactivity iscoupled to the regulation of the pluripotent phenotype . Finally , and in agreement with the TIRF data , three - dimensional reconstruction of confocal microscopy im - ages , depicting the entire colony , further validated the pres - ence of VSFs concentrated at the colony - ECM interface in hiPSCs and a clear transition in actin morphology upon differentiation ( Figure 4H and Movie S4 ) . These results imply that pluripotency associated FAs and VSFs at the col - ony edge , in addition to tightly controlled integrin and SRC activity , are critical for regulation of adhesion strength and maintenance of hPSC colonies and that stem cell dif - ferentiation involves signi\ufb01cant alterations in FA composi - tion , mechanotransduction , and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton . DISCUSSION hPSCs self - organize into sharp - edged colonies in culture ( Ginis et al . , 2004 ) . Our discovery of a unique FA - depen - dent actin fence encircling hPSC colonies that contributes to pluripotency provides a high - resolution view into the physical constraints of these colonies . Recently , congruent with our \ufb01ndings , hESC colonies were reported to display strong ECM interactions and enhanced myosin activity at the colony edge ( Przybyla et al . , 2016a ; Rosowski et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , other work has suggested 10 - fold higher cell - ECM tractions in human versus mouse ESC colonies ( Chowdhury et al . , 2010 ) . Force involves the activation of the Rho - ROCK - myosin signaling cascade and affects FA size , composition , and position ( Katoh et al . , 2011 ) , so the exceptionally large hPSC FAs are likely to be linked to the strong traction stress produced by the connecting VSFs . Long - term culturing with ROCKi improves cloning ef\ufb01 - ciency , but is believed not to affect pluripotency . Based on our data , ROCKi - treated cells remain pluripotent but display lower levels of SOX2 , in line with the ability of ROCKi to limit pluripotency and prime hiPSCs for epithe - lial - to - mesenchymal transition and mesodermal differenti - ation ( Maldonado et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , differentiation is particularly apparent at the colony edge ( Rosowski et al . , 2015 ; Warm\ufb02ash et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting that mechanical properties may in\ufb02uence the outcome of differentiation cues . These \ufb01ndings support the notion that tight colony morphology is required for complete pluripotency . Figure 4 .

Given that active SRC localizes to FAs in hiPSC colonies and SRC inhibition disturbs colony morphology and adhesion , force - directed SRC signaling in FAs might have an important role in sup - porting pluripotency . We \ufb01nd that integrin activity is dramatically increased upon differentiation , in line with a recent observation that forced activation with Mn 2 + can induce differentiation ( Villa - Diaz et al . , 2016 ) . The underlying mechanism re - stricting integrin activity in hPSCs and potential plu - ripotency - linked integrin inactivating factors will be an interesting avenue for future investigation . Taken together , our data are supportive of a working model whereby hiPSC colonies exist as an integrated assembly of weakly adhering inner \u2018\u2018center\u2019\u2019 cells , with low b 1 - integrin activity , surrounded by a border of \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 cells with large \u2018\u2018corner - stone\u2019\u2019 FAs with high SRC and integrin activity linked by strong contractile VSFs . Together , these structures generate the fence required to maintain compact pluripotent colony morphology . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES See also Supplemental Experimental Procedures .

Membrane trafficking is tightly coupled to membrane tension 26 and can modulate the latter by addition or removal of the membrane . However , 27 the cellular pathway ( s ) involved in these processes are poorly understood . Here 28 we find that , among a number of endocytic processes operating simultaneously 29 at the cell surface , a dynamin and clathrin - independent pathway , the 30 CLIC / GEEC ( CG ) pathway , is rapidly and specifically upregulated upon 31 reduction of tension . On the other hand , inhibition of the CG pathway results in 32 lower membrane tension , while up regulation significantly enhances membrane 33 tension . We find that vinculin , a well - studied mechanotransducer , mediates the 34 tension - dependent regulation of the CG pathway . Vinculin negatively regulates a 35 key CG pathway regulator , GBF1 , at the plasma membrane in a tension 36 dependent manner . Thus , the CG pathway operates in a mechanochemical 37 feedback loop with membrane tension potentially leading to homeostatic 38 regulation of plasma membrane tension . 39 Introduction 40 Living cells sense and use force for multiple functions like development 1 , 41 differentiation 2 , gene expression 3 , migration 4 and cancer progression 5 . Cells respond 42 to changes in tension , passively by creating membrane invaginations / blebs 6 \u2013 8 and 43 actively , by modulating cytoskeletal - membrane connections , mechanosensitive 44 channels and membrane trafficking 4 , 9 , 10 . Membrane trafficking through endo - exocytic 45 processes can respond and modulate the membrane tension 10 . While exocytosis acts to 46 reduce plasma membrane tension as a consequence of increasing net membrane area , 47 endocytosis could function to reduce membrane area and enhance membrane tension . 48 Membrane tension has long been shown to affect the endocytic process . Decreasing 49 tension upon stimulated secretion or by addition of amphiphilic compounds increases 50 endocytosis 11 12 . On the other hand , an increase in tension upon hypotonic shock 11 or 51 as evinced during mitosis 12 , results in a decrease in endocytosis . Increase in 52 membrane tension on spreading is also compensated via an increase in exocytosis 53 from endocytic recycling compartment providing extra membrane 13 . Together these 54 observations suggest that endocytosis responds to changes in membrane tension or 55 changes in membrane area . However , the specific endocytic mechanisms involved in 56 these responses have not been elucidated . The well - studied dynamin - dependent , 57 clathrin - mediated endocytic ( CME ) pathway is relatively unaffected by changes in 58 tension 14 while caveolae help to passively buffer membrane tension 7 . 59 We had recently shown that upon relaxing the externally induced strain on cells , 60 tubule like membrane invaginations termed as \u2018reservoirs\u2019 are created 6 . This initial 61 response is a purely passive mechanical response of the plasma membrane and is also 62 observed in synthetic lipid membranes . Similar structures are also formed on recovery 63 from hypo - osmotic shock termed as \u2018vacuole like dilations\u2019 ( VLDs ) . VLDs form 64 passively , similar to reservoirs , albeit different in shape . Subsequent to the formation 65 of either reservoirs or VLDs , cells engage in an active ATP - dependent response that 66 occurs efficiently only at physiological temperatures to restore their morphology and 67 membrane tension 6 . This indicates the deployment of specific active cellular 68 processes following the passive response ( see the cartoon in Fig 1a ) . 69 .

We have tested the 70 functioning of multiple endocytic pathways on modulation of membrane tension by 71 different approaches . In parallel , we have determined the effects of modulating 72 endocytic processes on membrane tension by utilizing optical or magnetic tweezers to 73 measure membrane tension . Subsequent to the passive membrane response we had 74 observed earlier 6 , we find that a clathrin , caveolin and dynamin - independent 75 endocytic mechanism , the CLIC / GEEC ( CG ) pathway , rapidly responds to changes in 76 membrane tension , acting to restore it to a specific set point . Perturbing the CG 77 pathway directly modulates membrane tension forming a negative feedback loop with 78 membrane tension to maintain homeostasis . A previously identified mechanical 79 transducer , vinculin , is involved in the homeostatic control of tension ; in its absence 80 the CG pathway fails to respond to changes in membrane tension , thereby altering the 81 set point . 82 RESULTS : 83 A rapid endocytic response to changes in membrane tension 84 Active cellular processes are involved in resorbing the \u2018reservoirs\u2019 or \u2018VLDs\u2019 formed 85 following a strain relaxation 6 . To determine whether endocytosis could be one such 86 active process , we monitored the extent of endocytosis by providing a timed pulse of 87 a fluid - phase marker , fluorescent - dextran ( F - Dex ) , during and immediately after the 88 stretch - relax procedure ( using a custom built stretch device 6 shown in Fig . 1b ) . 89 Compared to cells at steady state , there was a dramatic increase in fluid - phase 90 endocytosis immediately after relaxation of the strain ( Fig . 1c ) while uptake was 91 markedly reduced during the application of the strain ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . This 92 increase in endocytosis was transient and disappeared as early as 90 seconds after 93 strain relaxation ( Fig . 1c ) . This also corresponds to the time scale of resorption of 94 reservoirs by an active process observed earlier 6 . By rapidly upregulating endocytosis , 95 cells thus respond to a net decrease in tension in a fast , transient fashion returning 96 swiftly to a steady state . 97 Earlier studies indicated that exocytosis helped add membrane rapidly in response to 98 increased membrane tension during cell spreading 15 . On deadhering , cells round off 99 decreasing their surface area while on replating , cells spread by adding membrane . 100 Thus it is likely that endocytic pathways could help retrieve membrane on deadhering 101 due to decrease in net membrane tension 8 , 16 . We reasoned that if an endocytic process 102 is responding to the release of strain during the deadhering process , it would be 103 upregulated during the detachment process . To monitor the extent of endocytosis we 104 followed the uptake of a timed pulse of F - Dex during and immediately after the 105 detachment ( 3 minutes ) and compared it to that measured in the spread state ( Fig . 1d 106 schematic ) . Our results showed that the net fluid - phase uptake underwent a rapid 107 increase while the cells were de - adhering ( 3 minutes ) , but subsided back to the steady 108 state level once it was de - adhered and held in suspension ( Fig . 1d ) . Recycling of the 109 endocytic material is similar between steady state and deadhering ( Supplementary 110 Fig . 1b ) . This indicates that there is no block in the recycling rate during deadhering 111 and increase in uptake on deadhering is due to a transient increase in endocytic 112 potential . 113 To further consolidate our findings , we used an alternate method to alter membrane 114 tension . We shifted cells from hypotonic to isotonic medium , which made passive 115 .

This method also results in an 116 enhancement of fluid - phase endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) , consistent with the 117 results obtained by the other two methods of altering membrane tension . Together 118 these results suggest that reduction of membrane tension via a number of different 119 methods triggered a fast and transient endocytic response on the time scale of 120 seconds . 121 Membrane tension and the response of multiple endocytic pathways 122 To ascertain which of the multiple endocytic pathways respond to changes in tension , 123 we examined cargo previously shown to be endocytosed via these distinct pathways . 124 A number of endocytic pathways function concurrently at the cell surface 17 \u2013 20 . In 125 addition to the well characterized CME pathway , there are pathways that are 126 independent of clathrin but utilize dynamin for vesicle pinching 19 , 21 . Additionally , 127 there are clathrin and dynamin independent pathways which function in a number of 128 cell lines 22 \u2013 24 , but not in all 25 . The CLIC / GEEC ( clathrin independent carrier / GPI - 129 anchored protein enriched early endosomal compartment ) pathway is a clathrin and 130 dynamin - independent pathway , responsible for the internalization of a major fraction 131 of the fluid - phase and several GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - AP ) 22 , 24 , and other plasma 132 membrane proteins such as CD44 26 . Therefore , we used these specific cargoes to test 133 the response of different endocytic pathways while membrane tension was altered . 134 The endocytic uptake of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , a marker of CME , did not 135 increase in the cells which exhibited a transient rise in the fluid - phase after a 136 hypotonic shock ( Fig 2a ) or detachment ( Fig . 2b ) as visualized using two color 137 fluorescence microscopy . However , uptake of the folate receptor , a GPI - AP that is 138 internalized via the CG pathway 27 , 28 , exhibited a considerable increase ( Fig . 2c ) . This 139 indicated that clathrin - independent endocytosis rather than CME might be involved in 140 the fast response to a decrease in membrane tension . 141 There are endocytic pathways which utilize dynamin independent of clathrin 142 function 19 , 22 . Therefore we tested whether the increase in fluid - phase uptake requires 143 dynamin function . We used a conditional triple knock out cell line that removes 144 Dynamin 1 , 2 and 3 from the genome 29 , thereby abolishing all the dynamin - mediated 145 endocytic pathways ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . The dynamin triple knockout mouse 146 embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) shows higher steady state fluid - phase endocytosis 29 . 147 However , cells lacking all forms of dynamin also transiently increased their fluid - 148 phase endocytosis upon both stretch - relax cycles to the same extent as wild type 149 ( WT ) - MEFs ( Fig . 3a ) and hypotonic / isotonic media changes ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . 150 Thus , neither CME nor dynamin - dependent endocytic pathways appear to respond to 151 an acute reduction in membrane tension . 152 A caveolin - dependent endocytic process is important to retrieve specialized 153 membrane on deadhering 30 , and a caveolae - mediated passive mechanism is reported 154 to buffer the increase in membrane tension and prevent cell lysis triggered by the 155 flattening of caveolae 7 . To test if caveolin - dependent endocytic mechanisms could be 156 important for this rapid endocytic up - regulation , caveolin null MEFs were subjected 157 to the stretch - relax protocol . These cells exhibited a transient increase in fluid - phase 158 uptake similar to their WT controls ( Fig . 3a ) . In addition , caveolin - null cells also 159 exhibit a fast transient upregulation of fluid - phase endocytosis during de - adhering as 160 well ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . 161 .

For this , 163 we utilized Cholera Toxin bound HRP ( CTxBHRP ) , which marks the internalized 164 plasma membrane . We used a procedure in which the surface remnant peroxidase 165 reaction product is quenched with ascorbic acid , revealing only the internalized 166 CTxBHRP labeled membrane 26 . After 5 minutes post - deadhering the major endocytic 167 structures labeled had the typical morphology of CG carriers ( or CLICs ) comprising 168 structures with tubular and ring - shaped morphology ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . 169 Morphologically - identical structures were also observed in WT MEFs at steady 170 state 31 and in Cav1 - / - MEFs ( arrows , Supplementary Fig . 2d ) consistent with the 171 observation of fast fluid - phase uptake in Cav1 - / - cells via CG ( Fig . 3a and 172 Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . At this time point , surface - connected caveolae ( containing no 173 peroxidase - reaction product ) persist in the Cav - expressing WT cells ( arrowheads , 174 Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , consistent with the possibility that the caveolar pathway does 175 not play a significant role in transiently modulating endocytosis at these early times of 176 deadhering . 177 Together , these experiments indicated that the clathrin , dynamin or caveolin 178 dependent endocytic mechanisms do not exhibit a rapid respond to a reduction in 179 membrane tension . This is in contrast to fluid - phase or GPI - anchored protein uptake 180 which is endocytosed via the CG pathway . CG - mediated endocytosis is a high 181 capacity pathway capable of internalizing the equivalent of the entire plasma 182 membrane area in 12 minutes 26 , and of recycling a large fraction of endocytosed 183 material 32 . This pathway is also implicated in the delivery of membrane on cell 184 spreading in response to increases in membrane tension , thus helping to maintain 185 membrane homeostasis 9 , 13 . 186 CLIC / GEEC ( CG ) pathway responds to membrane tension 187 Since the CG cargo responded to changes in tension , we explored this finding in 188 further detail . CG pathway is regulated by small GTPase\u2019s , ARF1 , its GEF GBF1 , and 189 CDC42 at the plasma membrane 28 , 33 , 34 . Hence , we utilized small molecule inhibitors 190 of CDC42 and GBF1 to acutely inhibit CG pathway 35 , 36 . The CDC42 inhibitor , 191 ML141 decreases fluid - phase endocytosis in cells at steady state but not CME 192 ( Supplementary Fig3a ) , and prevents the increase in fluid - phase uptake upon 193 deadhering ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . In separate experiments , we utilized LG186 , an 194 inhibitor of GBF1 , which also decreases fluid - phase endocytosis in cells at steady 195 state but does not affect CME ( Supplementary Fig 3c ) . Inhibiting GBF1 prevents the 196 increase in fluid - phase endocytosis observed upon stretch - relax ( Fig . 3b ) or 197 deadhering ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . Similar to the decrease in fluid - phase on 198 increasing tension during stretch ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , CD44 , a CG pathway 199 specific cargo , shows reduced endocytosis during hypotonic shock ( Supplementary 200 Fig . 3e ) . 201 To further confirm that this response is due to CG endocytosis , we assessed the effect 202 of the stretch - relax protocol on cells that lack CG endocytosis . HeLa cells have been 203 shown to lack a robust CG endocytic pathway 25 , 27 . While the molecular basis for this 204 defect is not understood , we find that fluid - phase endocytosis in HeLa cells is not 205 susceptible to GBF1 inhibition by LG186 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . In addition , these 206 cells do not show an obvious recruitment of GBF1 to the plasma membrane in the 207 form of punctae as observed in cells exhibiting constitutive CG endocytosis such as 208 .

It is made The copyright holder for this preprint ( which this version posted October 25 , 2017 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 201509 doi : bioRxiv preprint 6 CHO cells as reported earlier 34 ( Supplementary Fig 4b / 4c ) . Correspondingly , these 209 cells did not exhibit a rapid increase in fluid - phase endocytosis on a hypotonic to 210 isotonic shift ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . 211 These experiments , combined with the up - regulated endocytosis of a CG specific 212 cargo ( GPI - AP ) ( Fig . 2c ) , suggest that the CG endocytic pathway is specifically 213 involved in the rapid , transient response to changes in membrane tension . 214 Passive and active membrane response to changes in membrane tension 215 As mentioned above , upon a rapid reduction in membrane tension , cells form passive 216 structures such as reservoirs and VLDs similar to the response of an artificial 217 membrane . Reservoirs are formed upon strain relaxation in the membrane after 218 stretching cells , whereas VLDs are formed by water expelled by the cell after a hypo - 219 to - isotonic - shock recovery 6 . Both reservoirs and VLDs are reabsorbed and disappear 220 within a couple of minutes , coincidental with an increase in endocytosis . This led us 221 to test if inhibiting the CG pathway could have a measurable impact on the rate of 222 disappearance of such passive structures . We find that the CG pathway exhibits 223 exquisite temperature sensitivity and is barely functional at room temperature ( RT ) , 224 and is not efficient even at 30 o C in comparison to CME in CHO cells ( Fig . 4a ) . 225 Correspondingly , the reservoir resorption in CHO cells was impaired after lowering 226 temperature ( Fig . 4b ) . In addition , inhibition of the CG pathway in CHO cells by 227 inhibiting GBF1 reduced the rate of reservoir reabsorption at 37 \u00b0C ( Fig . 4a ) . In 228 contrast , HeLa cells lacking a characteristic CG pathway did not show any difference 229 in the rate of disappearance of reservoirs upon inhibiting GBF1 and was much less 230 affected by lowering of temperature than CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Thus , 231 perturbing CG endocytosis affects the kinetics of resorption of reservoirs . 232 We next examined if passively generated structures could help initiate endocytosis at 233 the sites of their formation . Since the disappearance of each reservoir is gradual and 234 not as a single step process 6 ( Fig . 4b ) , this indicates that reservoirs are not likely to be 235 pinched off directly as endosomes . Further , we do not observe endosomes form at the 236 site of the reservoirs ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . To test this , we took advantage of our 237 earlier observation that cells plated on polyacrylamide gels do not form VLDs upon 238 hypotonic to isotonic shifts 6 . Whereas the lack of generation of VLDs was confirmed 239 in our cells grown on polyacrylamide ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , the cells still showed 240 an increase in endocytosis similar to when plated on glass , upon exposure to hypo - to - 241 isotonic - shock procedure ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Together , these data suggest that 242 CG endocytosis occurs subsequent to the passive responses of the membrane but the 243 passive invagination formation is not necessary to form CG endosomes . However , the 244 transient increase in CG endocytosis following the passive response helps swiftly 245 resorb the excess membrane helping to restore the membrane morphology . 246 Role of the CG pathway in setting membrane tension 247 Since the CG endocytic pathway responded to changes in membrane tension we 248 hypothesized that it might be involved in the setting of steady state membrane tension 249 as well . To explore this hypothesis , we directly measured tether forces by pulling 250 membrane tethers using optical tweezers 37 . The force experienced by membrane 251 tethers provides a way to measure the effective membrane tension 38 ( Fig 5a ) . We 252 found that acutely inhibiting the CG pathway by inhibiting GBF1 drastically reduced 253 .

To further assess this , we applied 0 . 5 nN 254 force pulses using a magnetic tweezer device to ConcanavalinA ( ConA ) - coated 255 magnetic beads attached to the cell membrane ( Supplementary Fig 5d ) . Consistent 256 with optical tweezers results , resistance to force ( stiffness ) was reduced in GBF1 257 inhibited cells ( Supplementary Fig 5e ) . That this effect was due to a reduction in 258 membrane tension and not any effects on the cytoskeleton , was corroborated by the 259 lack of a change in the measured stiffness of fibronectin - coated beads attached to cells 260 via integrin - fibronectin adhesions with and without GBF1 inhibition ( Supplementary 261 Fig 5f ) . 262 We next examined tether forces in cells wherein the CG pathway is up - regulated . We 263 reasoned that since the Dynamin TKO cells show a higher fluid - phase endocytosis 264 ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig 6c ) , it is likely that this would increase effective 265 membrane tension . Tether forces were indeed higher in the Dynamin TKO cells 266 compared to control cells ( Fig . 5d ) . Consistent with the role of the CG - pathway in 267 setting membrane tension , inhibiting the CG pathway in Dynamin TKO cells by 268 GBF1 inhibition ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig 5h ) reduced the effective membrane 269 tension below control levels ( Fig . 5d ) . 270 To further confirm this observation , we measured tether forces on acutely increasing 271 CG endocytosis by using BrefeldinA ( BFA ) as reported earlier 33 . BFA treatment 272 disrupts ER to Golgi secretion but also serves to free up ARF1 , making it available at 273 the cell surface to increase CG endocytosis 33 . We further confirm that this increase is 274 mediated through a GBF1 - sensitive CG endocytosis ( Fig 5e ) . We treated the cells 275 with BFA and measured tether forces using optical tweezers when the increase in 276 endocytosis was most prominent . Tether forces were higher on treating cells with 277 BFA compared to the control case ( Fig . 5f ) . BFA treatment inhibits secretion 39 and 278 this could also increase the effective membrane tension due to a reduction of 279 membrane delivery from the secretory pathway independent of its effect on CG 280 endocytosis . To test this , we treated HeLa cells with BFA . BFA treatment disrupted 281 the Golgi in both CHO and HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) consistent with its 282 inhibition of the secretory pathway . However , neither fluid - phase uptake ( Fig . 5e ) nor 283 the tether forces were affected in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5f ) . This indicated that the increase 284 in tension in CHO cells on BFA treatment is due to an increase in CG endocytosis and 285 not due to a block in secretion in these timescales . 286 Hence , modulating the CG pathway by activating or inhibiting key regulators 287 modifies effective membrane tension directly . Since CG pathway is negatively 288 regulated by membrane tension , this indicates that CG pathway operates in a negative 289 feedback loop with membrane tension . Since CG pathway is specifically modulated 290 by tension , it is conceivable that the molecular machinery regulating CG pathway 291 would be modulated by changes in tension . 292 Mechanical manipulation of the CG endocytosis machinery 293 We tested if key regulatory molecules involved in different endocytic pathways could 294 be directly modulated by changes in tension . GBF1 is involved in the CG pathway 295 and re - localizes from the cytosol to distinct punctae at the plasma membrane upon 296 activation as visualized using TIRF microscopy 33 , 34 . We imaged GBF1 - GFP 297 recruitment to the plasma membrane in live cells using TIRF microscopy , during a 298 hypotonic shock and after recovering from it . GBF1 punctae were lost on hypotonic 299 .

On 300 the other hand , recovery from a hypotonic shock caused the rapid assembly of GBF1 301 punctae ( Fig 6a and Fig 6b ) . In contrast , clathrin , which is localized from cytosol to 302 membrane to help in CME is not affected by these similar changes in tension 303 ( Supplementary Fig 6a ) . These experiments indicated that molecular machinery 304 involved in regulating the CG pathway was modulated by membrane tension unlike 305 that of the CME pathway . 306 Vinculin serves as a mechanotransducer for CG endocytosis 307 For cells to respond to changes in tension , sensing and transduction of this 308 information must occur . Since focal adhesion related molecules help transduce and 309 respond to force 5 , 40 , 41 we hypothesized these molecules could transduce a physical 310 stimuli ( membrane tension ) to regulate endocytic processes as well . Indeed , few of 311 these proteins were \u2018hits\u2019 in a recent RNAi screen for genes that influence CG 312 endocytosis 42 . Focal adhesion is an intricate macromolecular complex that has 313 multiple functional modules 43 and vinculin is a critical part of this 314 mechanotransduction machinery 40 , 41 , 43 . Unlike the \u2018hits\u2019 , Talin or p130CAS , there is 315 only a single functional isoform of vinculin in non - muscle cells , and cell lines 316 deficient for this protein are viable . Therefore we used a vinculin null fibroblast cell 317 line to test the role of this mechanotransducer in the mechano - responsive behavior of 318 CG pathway . 319 To directly test if vinculin could be involved in the tension - sensitive regulation of the 320 CG pathway , we stretched vinculin null cells . Unlike WT MEFs that shows ~ 82 % 321 drop in uptake on stretching ( Supplementary Fig 1a ) , vinculin null cells show only 322 ~ 36 % drop at the same strain ( Fig 7a ) . Increasing the extent of hypotonic shock 323 showed a concomitant decrease in fluid - phase endocytosis of WT cells ( Fig 7b ) . By 324 contrast , vinculin null MEFs were much more refractory to the same extent of 325 hypotonic shock ( Fig 7b ) . Furthermore , upon strain - relaxation , fluid - phase 326 endocytosis in vinculin null MEFs did not show an increase ( Fig 7a ) , unlike that 327 observed for CHO cells ( Fig 1c ) or wild type MEFs ( Fig 3a ) . This was further tested 328 in the deadhering assay where vinculin null cells again did not show an increased 329 fluid - phase uptake , unlike the WT control cells ( Supplementary Fig 6c ) . Thus 330 vinculin null cells do not respond to changes in tension similar to the WT cells . 331 Fluid - phase uptake in vinculin null MEFs is much higher than wild type cells ( Fig 332 7c ) . To test if the endocytic effects of vinculin null cells are specifically due to 333 vinculin , we expressed full length vinculin in vinculin null cells . This caused a 334 decrease in fluid - phase endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig 6d ) . Further , inhibiting GBF1 335 in vinculin - null cells with LG186 decreased fluid - phase uptake to the same levels as 336 cells expressing vinculin , confirming that a GBF1 sensitive CG pathway is functional 337 here ( Supplementary Fig 6d ) . This indicates that GBF1 operates downstream of 338 vinculin and vinculin negatively regulates CG pathway . 339 Since vinculin - null cells have a higher basal endocytosis rate it is possible that they 340 are unable to increase their endocytic capacity further in response to a decrease in 341 membrane tension . However , vinculin null cells respond to BFA treatment to increase 342 their endocytic rate in a manner that is also sensitive to GBF1 inhibition , similar to 343 wild type cells ( Supplementary Fig 7a ) . 344 .

The level of punctae remained constant and failed to respond to 346 hypotonic shock ( Fig 7d ) unlike that observed in WT MEF ( Fig 6a ) . The density of 347 GBF1 punctae at the plasma membrane was also slightly higher in vinculin null cells 348 compared to WT cells ( Supplementary Fig 6b ) . This is consistent with higher fluid - 349 phase endocytosis in vinculin null cells compared to control MEF cell line ( Fig 7c ) . 350 Further , we tested how the steady state membrane tension in vinculin null cells is 351 compared to WT cells . Tether forces measured using optical tweezers showed a 352 higher value for vinculin null cells compared to wild type cells ( Fig 8a ) . The high 353 tether force in cells lacking vinculin was drastically reduced on inhibiting the CG 354 pathway ( Fig 8a ) , consistent with the role of the CG pathway in regulating the 355 effective membrane tension . These experiments show that vinculin acts as a negative 356 regulator of CG pathway and is necessary for the transduction of physical stimuli for 357 the biochemical control of the CG pathway . 358 DISCUSSION 359 Membrane tension has been long proposed to be tightly coupled to vesicular 360 trafficking through endo - exocytic pathways . However , the specific trafficking 361 mechanisms have remained elusive . Here , we show that membrane tension and CG 362 endocytosis operate in a negative feedback loop that helps restore any change from a 363 set point ( model : Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . When membrane tension decreases , it 364 transiently triggers the CG pathway , bringing about a fast endocytic response to reset 365 the cell\u2019s resting membrane tension . On the other hand , increasing membrane tension 366 has the opposite effect ; the CG endocytosis is inhibited in a proportional manner . The 367 membrane flux through the CG pathway also has an effect on the effective membrane 368 tension . Acutely lowering the CG pathway decreases membrane tension while 369 upregulating the pathway increases membrane tension . Thus , changes in membrane 370 tension lead to an inverse effect on CG endocytosis , while changes in CG endocytosis 371 lead to a direct effect on plasma membrane tension . This type of a response known as 372 a negative feedback loop is used in many different biological contexts to maintain 373 homeostasis 44 . 374 The CG endocytic pathway specifically responds to acute changes in membrane 375 tension despite multiple pathways operating simultaneously at the plasma membrane . 376 Caveolae passively buffer increases in tension 7 , while the clathrin - mediated pathway 377 concentrates specific ligands and mediates robust endocytosis despite the increase in 378 tension 14 . De - adhered cells exhibit an increased caveolin - mediated internalization that 379 persists over hours , and is crucial for the removal of specific membrane constituents 380 and anchorage - dependent growth and anoikis 30 . On the other hand , unlike the 381 caveolar pathway , the CG pathway showed a higher transient upregulation of 382 endocytosis only during deadhering which does not persist in suspension . 383 The fast response of the CG pathway on strain relaxation is lost within 90 seconds . 384 The loss of this transient response could be even faster as at present 90 seconds is the 385 dead time in our experiments . Fast clathrin - independent mechanisms have been 386 reported in different contexts . Ultrafast endocytosis occurs at synapses following a 387 synaptic vesicle fusion to retrieve the excess membrane . This fast clathrin - 388 independent but dynamin - dependent process is temperature sensitive as well 45 , 46 . 389 Endophilin dependent FEME pathway is another clathrin - independent but dynamin - 390 .

HeLa cells seem to predominantly have AP2 , GRAF1 and 391 dynamin - dependent machinery 25 . Consistent with this , inhibiting AP2 or GRAF1 in 392 HeLa cells inhibits fluid - phase endocytosis . These cells respond in a slower rate to the 393 changes in osmotic shock and shows blebbing on inhibiting this pathway due to lack 394 of endocytosis 47 . Here , we find that the GBF1 / ARF1 / CDC42 dependent CG pathway 395 shows a fast transient response to changes in tension and is more sensitive to lowering 396 of physiological temperature compared to the CME pathway . In the absence of such a 397 fast pathway , other slower endocytic mechanisms operate to internalize the excess 398 membrane , lack of which might lead to blebbing . The CG pathway helps to swiftly 399 respond and reset any changes from the steady state , thereby also helping to set the 400 resting membrane tension of a cell . This indicates that different endocytic pathways 401 have distinct functions and the CG pathway may be responsible for membrane tension 402 homeostasis . 403 Similar to the endocytic response , exocytic processes in a cell could modulate and 404 respond to changes in tension . Exocytic processes in a cell help in addition of 405 membrane to the cell surface and reduction of membrane tension 9 . Unlike 406 endocytosis , exocytosis seems to be positively regulated by membrane tension . High 407 membrane tension increases the exocytic rate and could regulate the mechanism of 408 vesicle fusion 48 , 49 . Increase in membrane tension during cell spreading activates 409 exocytosis to increase spread area through a GPI - anchored protein rich endocytic 410 recycling compartment 13 , 15 . This increase in area is independent of secretory pathway 411 or other exocytic mechanisms . CG pathway takes in a major fraction of GPI - anchored 412 proteins 27 and recycles a huge fraction of its endocytic volume 32 . On increasing 413 tension , we find that CG endocytosis is downregulated preventing further increase in 414 tension but it could be recycling through CG pathway that helps add membrane to 415 restore the steady state tension ( Cartoon : Fig 8b ) . Thus , regulation of membrane 416 cycling through the endo - exocytic leg of CG pathway could be important in 417 membrane homeostasis and further research would help bring about a complete view 418 of this mechanism . 419 We find that the active response by CG pathway follows the passive response via 420 membrane invaginations ( i . e . reservoirs and VLD ) and helps in efficient resorption of 421 these passive local membrane structures . There could be other active cellular 422 mechanisms driving the flattening of these invaginations as well . However , these 423 membrane invaginations are not necessary for the creation of the CG endosomes . 424 Thus , following a reduction in tension these are two parallel responses by the cell , one 425 passive and the other active eventually leading to excess membrane internalization 426 through CG endosomes . 427 Similar to the passive response , physical parameters could directly regulate the active 428 endocytic machinery by influencing the extent of membrane deformation needed to 429 make an endocytic vesicle . A higher membrane tension makes it more difficult to 430 deform the membrane , thus producing fewer endosomes , and vice versa , alleviating 431 the need for a specific mechanotransduction machinery . However , our results from 432 studying the vinculin - null cells suggest otherwise . Vinculin , a key focal adhesion 433 protein , transduces many mechanical inputs at the site of the focal adhesion into 434 information for the cell to process 41 , 43 , 50 . In this context , it appears that vinculin plays 435 a central role in transducing the increase ( or decrease ) in membrane tension to the CG 436 pathway to help inhibit ( or activate ) its endocytic mechanism ( Cartoon : Fig 8b ) .

In WT cells , GBF1 forms tension - sensitive punctae at the cell surface 439 wherein increasing tension abolishes these punctae and decreasing tension increases 440 it . In the vinculin - null cells , this tension - dependent regulation is lost and CG 441 endocytosis appears to be uncoupled from tension regulation . Thus , vinculin is 442 important for a tension - sensitive negative regulation of a key effector of CG pathway , 443 translating mechanical information into a biochemical read out to influence the 444 endocytic rate . This negative feedback loop between effective membrane tension and 445 CG pathway thus is mediated through vinculin and maintains the cells at a lower 446 effective membrane tension . Different functional modules operate in a focal adhesion 447 for mechanotransduction 43 . However , the precise mechanism behind the ability for 448 vinculin to regulate the availability of GBF1 at the cell surface is not yet understood 449 and is a subject of further investigation . 450 Modulations in membrane tension are used in multiple cellular processes 4 , 51 \u2013 54 and 451 CG pathway could have a role in these . In migrating fibroblasts , CG endosomes are 452 localized to the leading edge and transient ablation of these endosomes inhibits 453 efficient migration 26 . Increase in the membrane tension at the leading edge keeps the 454 neutrophil cells polarized and helps in its migration 54 . In a separate study in 455 neutrophils , GBF1 localizes to the leading edge by binding to products of 456 phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , recruits ARF1 , and this localization is needed 457 for unified cell polarity 55 . We have found that PI3K products help recruit GBF1 to the 458 plasma membrane and this is necessary for CG endocytosis 56 . Thus , one could 459 speculate that a polarized CG pathway and its regulators operating in migrating cells 460 could be modulating membrane tension by regulating membrane trafficking . 461 Endocytic pathways are proposed to be at the core of a eukaryotic cellular plan 462 integrating multiple inputs over spatio - temporal scales 57 . They are also necessary for 463 tissue patterning : the CG pathway is utilized for Wingless signaling for patterning of 464 the Drosophila wing disc during larval development 56 . Here we find that a high 465 capacity CG pathway that turns over a huge fraction of the plasma membrane 26 , 32 and 466 sensitive to membrane composition 32 is modulated by temperature and 467 mechanochemical inputs . A vinculin - mediated negative feedback loop between 468 membrane tension and the CG pathway helps maintain the cell at a lower tension set 469 point ( Cartoon : Fig 8b ) . This could also help in increasing the potential for 470 modulating membrane tension to regulate other cellular processes . Thus , the CG 471 pathway responds and coordinates a variety of cellular inputs including membrane 472 tension and is likely to function in multiple physiological contexts . 473 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 474 We thank Pietro De Camilli ( Yale University , USA ) for conditional Dynamin triple 475 knock out cell line , Daniel R\u00f6sel ( Charles University , Prague ) for vinculin null cell 476 line , Darius V K\u00f6ster for the Caveolin null cell line , David J Stephens ( University of 477 Bristol , UK ) for an initial gift of LG186 , Feroz M .

( n = 20 ( Vin + / + ) , 25 819 ( Vin + / + with LG186 ) , 25 ( Vin - / - ) and 29 ( Vin - / - with LG186 ) ) . Vinculin null cells 820 shows a higher basal membrane tension compared to WT MEF ; inhibiting the CG 821 pathway drastically reduced membrane tension in both cell lines . ( b ) CG pathway and 822 membrane tension operates in a vinculin dependent negative feedback loop to 823 maintain homeostasis . Reduction of tension from its steady state leads to a passive 824 response by the formation of reservoirs or VLDs . The decrease in the effective 825 tension inactivates a vinculin - dependent machinery , resulting in an increase in active 826 GBF1 , which increases the CG pathway and rapid internalization of the excess 827 membrane . This is a fast transient response that appears to restore the steady state . On 828 the other hand , increasing the membrane tension from steady state activates vinculin 829 dependent machinery , inhibiting the CG pathway , via the reduction of GBF1 830 recruitment . The increase in effective tension could also activate exocytic machinery 831 which adds membrane resulting in restoration of the steady state . Thus , a vinculin 832 dependent mechanochemical - regulation of the CG pathway through a negative 833 feedback loop helps in maintaining plasma membrane tension homeostasis . 834 835 .

HeLa cells do not show surface punctae 932 formation unlike CHO cells ( b ) . Quantification of the TIRF to wide field ratio of 933 GBF1 - GFP levels shows ( c ) that GBF1 translocation to surface is much lower in 934 HeLa cells . Each point is value from a cell and quantified from two different 935 experiments ( n = 23 ( CHO ) and 20 ( HeLa ) ) . ( d ) Rapid shifting from hypotonic to 936 isotonic state does not result in an increase in fluid - phase uptake in HeLa Cells . HeLa 937 cells were pulsed with TMR - Dextran ( fluid ) for 1 minute either in steady state ( Iso ) or 938 after hypotonic shock of one minute ( Hypo - Iso ) . Images ( left ) of endocytosed TMR - 939 Dex and histogram show the extent of fluid - phase uptake . Data represent the mean 940 intensity per cell ( \u00b1 S . D ) from two different experiments with duplicates containing at 941 least 100 cells per experiment . ( e ) Reservoir adsorption in HeLa cells does not 942 respond to GBF1 inhibition . The reservoir fluorescence intensity after stretch relax of 943 HeLa cells transfected with a fluorescent membrane marker ( pEYFP - mem ) was 944 quantified as a function of time at 37 o C in the absence ( 37\u00b0C control ) or presence of 945 LG186 ( 37\u00b0C inhibitor ) , or at room temperature ( 26\u00b0C control ) . Each point represents 946 mean \u00b1 s . e . m from more than 200 reservoirs from at least 10 cells . Note while 947 treatment with LG186 had no effect on the rate of reservoir resorption , lowering of 948 the temperature also had only a marginal reduction in the rate of resorption . Scale bar , 949 10 \u00b5m . 950 Supplementary Figure 5 : ( a ) Reservoirs formed on stretch - relax does not colocalize 951 with endosomes . A pH sensitive SecGFP - GPI transfected CHO cells are stretched for 952 one minute and relaxed in pH 7 . 4 buffer ( pH 7 , top left ) at 37 o C showing formation of 953 reservoirs as before . The pH is made acidic ( pH 5 . 5 ) after 30 seconds to quench 954 surface fluorescence . Only internal vesicles at neutral pH remain fluorescent and thus 955 helps to capture newly formed endosomes on stretch - relax ( pH 5 , top right ) . The 956 reservoirs does not colocalize with the newly formed endosomes ( bottom , insets ) . ( b ) 957 The cells transfected with CAAX - GFP to mark the membrane are plated on glass 958 ( left ) or polyacrylamide gels . Cells were incubated with hypo - osmotic medium for 959 one minute followed by isotonic recovery . Images of VLDs are observed only in the 960 cells grown on glass . Insets show a magnification of the edge of the cells where VLDs 961 are expected to form . ( c ) Endocytic pulse of 90 seconds is done either in isotonic 962 situation or after release of hypotonic shock of 1 minute in cells plated on glass or gel . 963 Mean uptake per cell after release of hypotonic shock for either gel or glass is 964 normalized to its uptake in isotonic conditions ( dotted line ) . Data represent the mean 965 intensity per cell ( \u00b1 S . D ) from two different experiments with duplicates containing at 966 least 100 cells per experiment . ( d ) Cartoon depicts a magnetic tweezer set up to 967 measure membrane stiffness . An electromagnet with a sharpened tip was used to 968 apply a 0 . 5 nN pulsatory force ( 1 Hz ) to paramagnetic beads coated with either 969 fibronectin fragment ( FN ) or ConcanavalinA ( ConA ) , attached to cells as described in 970 methods . Bead movement in response to applied force was then tracked , and bead 971 stiffness was calculated during the first 10 seconds of the measurement in units of 972 nN / \u00b5m . ( e , f ) Inhibiting of CG pathway with LG186 lowers membrane stiffness . 973 ConA ( e ) or Fibronectin fragment ( f ) coated paramagnetic beads were attached to 974 cells treated without ( Control ) or with LG186 for 30 minute . Beads were pulled using 975 the magnetic tweezer as described , and membrane stiffness calculated . Note LG186 976 treatment lowers membrane stiffness only when ConA - coated beads are pulled , 977 whereas FN - coated beads are unaffected . This indicates that the LG186 treatment 978 does not disrupt the cortical cytoskeleton that interacts with the integrin - engaged FN - 979 coated beads , but lowers general membrane tension as experienced by the ConA - 980 .

The box plot shows the stiffness values in nN / \u00b5m in each of the tethers 981 pulled for the different conditions . ( g ) BrefeldinA ( BFA ) treatment causes disruption 982 in GM130 distribution in both HeLa cells and CHO cells . Cells were treated with 20 983 \u00b5g / ml of BFA for 45 minute , fixed , permeabilized and labelled with GM130 antibody 984 to mark cis - Golgi and imaged on a wide field microscope . BFA treatment disrupts the 985 peri - nuclear localization in both CHO and HeLa cells , indicating that BFA is 986 functional in both cell types . ( h ) The increase in fluid - phase uptake in Dynamin TKO 987 is inhibited by LG186 treatment . WT or Dynamin TKO cells ( prepared as described 988 in methods ) were treated with LG186 or with the vehicle ( DMSO ; Control ) , and 989 incubated with TMR - Dex for 5 minutes , washed and fixed prior to imaging on a Wide 990 Field microscope . The images show that while Dyn TKO cells exhibit a higher fluid - 991 phase uptake that the WT cells , this uptake is sensitive to the inhibition of GBF1 , 992 confirming that it is the CG endocytosis that has a higher activity in Dynamin TKO 993 cells ( quantified in Fig . 5c ) . Scale bar , 10 \u00b5m . 994 Supplementary Figure 6 : ( a ) WT cells transfected with clathrin light chain ( CLC - 995 mCherry ) was imaged live using TIRF microscopy during osmotic changes as 996 indicated . Images ( Left panel ) and graph ( right ) show the quantification of number of 997 CLC punctae per cell normalized to the steady state number of punctae from 13 cells . 998 Note that the number of clathrin pits at the cell surface do not respond to changes in 999 tension . Scale bar , 10 \u00b5m . ( b ) GBF1 punctae in vinculin null cells are higher . GBF1 - 1000 GFP is transfected in either WT - MEF or vinculin null MEF and imaged in TIRF . The 1001 number of punctae per cell were counted and normalized to the surface area . The plot 1002 shows the average number of spots in each cell type normalized to those obtained in 1003 WT - MEF . Each point in the box plot represents measurements collected from a single 1004 cell ( WT MEF , n = 12 ; ( VIN NULL , n = 13 ) , accumulated . ( c ) Cells were pulsed with 1005 F - Dex either during deadhering or in spread state for 3 minutes and the pulse is 1006 stopped using ice cold buffer as described before . De - adhered cells are added to vial 1007 containing ice cold buffer and allowed to attach on a fresh coverslip bottom dish to be 1008 fixed and imaged . Endosomal intensity per cell is quantified and normalized to the 1009 intensity of the WT spread . Note that Vinculin null cells show higher endocytosis 1010 compared to WT cells but does not show increase in uptake on deadhering unlike WT 1011 cells . ( d ) Vinculin null cells rescued by transfection with WT - Vinculin full length 1012 ( VIN + ) and vinculin null cells were treated with LG186 to check sensitivity to GBF1 1013 inhibition of fluid - phase endocytosis . Cells treated with LG186 for 30 minutes were 1014 pulsed for 5 minutes with F - Dex , washed , fixed and imaged . Endocytic uptake per 1015 cell is quantified and after normalizing to the untreated Vin null case ( Control ) is 1016 plotted as shown . Note adding back vinculin reduces the fluid - phase uptake . However 1017 in both in the Vinculin null as well as in the cells in which Vinculin is added back , 1018 endocytic uptake of the fluid - phase remains sensitive to LG186 , indicating a role for 1019 vinculin in negatively regulating the CG pathway . Data represent the mean intensity 1020 per cell ( \u00b1 S . D ) from two different experiments with technical duplicates with at least 1021 100 cells per experiment . * : P < 0 . 001 , ns : not significant . 1022 Supplementary Figure 7 : ( a ) Vinculin cells were either untreated ( Control ) or 1023 treated with either LG186 ( LG186 ) , BFA ( BFA ) or BFA followed by LG186 1024 treatment ( BFA LG186 ) . Cells were pulsed with F - Dex for 3 minutes and uptake per 1025 cell quantified as detailed in Methods , normalized to control , and plotted in the 1026 histogram ( left ) . The histogram and Images ( right ) show that BFA treatment causes an 1027 increase in fluid - phase uptake in vinculin null cells and treating with LG186 inhibits 1028 .

This indicates that the CG pathway is 1029 operational and capable of being upregulated in the vinculin null cells . Data represent 1030 the mean intensity per cell ( \u00b1 S . D ) from two different experiments with duplicates 1031 containing at least 100 cells per experiment . * : P < 0 . 001 , ns : not significant . Scale 1032 bar , 10 \u00b5m . ( b ) Model for maintaining membrane tension homeostasis . Different 1033 processes such as endocytosis , hypotonic shock , and adhesion increase effective 1034 membrane tension ( arrow headed line ) while exocytosis , hypertonic medium and 1035 deadhering would reduce the effective membrane tension ( bar headed line ) . This 1036 effective membrane tension is a physical parameter that activates a vinculin 1037 dependent mechano - transduction machinery . Depending on the change in tension in 1038 relation to a steady state set point , this mechanotransduction machinery inhibits the 1039 activity of GBF1 at the cell surface ( red bar headed line ) . Higher effective membrane 1040 tension in relation to the steady state would activate vinculin mediated machinery and 1041 inhibit GBF1 . GBF1 levels at the cell surface is crucial for the activity of the CG 1042 pathway and thus directly regulates the level of the endocytosis ( green arrow headed 1043 line ) . Thus any modulation of the membrane tension could be balanced by this 1044 negative feedback loop to maintain tension homoeostasis . 1045 1046 .

HF12 media ( HiMEDIA , 1052 Mumbai , India ) and DMEM ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with NaHCO 3 and L - 1053 Glutamin / Penicillin / Streptomycin solution ( Sigma Aldrich ) was used for growing 1054 CHO cells and the different MEF lines respectively . 1055 BrefeldinA ( BFA ) ( Sigma Aldrich ) , ML141 ( Tocris Bioscience ) and LG186 ( see 1056 synthesis section below ) dissolved in DMSO was used at 20 \u00b5g / ml , 10\u00b5M and 10\u00b5M 1057 respectively . ML141 and LG186 treatment was done for 30 minutes in serum free 1058 media and maintained during endocytic assays . Tetra methyl rhodamine labelled 1059 dextran ( TMR - Dex ) ( 10 , 000MW ; Molecular probes , Thermofisher Scientific ) was 1060 used at 1mg / ml . 4 \u2013 hydroxy tamoxifen ( Sigma Aldrich ) was used at 3 \u00b5M to remove 1061 Dynamin 1 / 2 / 3 from the conditional dynamin triple knockout MEF cells as reported 1062 previously 29 . TrypLE express ( GIBCO , Invitrogen ) was used to detach cells 1063 according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction . SYLGARD 184 silicone elastomer kit ( Dow 1064 Corning ) was used to make PDMS sheets according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction . For 1065 the reservoir experiments , cells were transfected with a membrane targeting plasmid 1066 pEYFP - mem ( Clontech ) using the Neon transfection device according to the 1067 manufacturer\u2019s protocol as described earlier 6 . 1068 Endocytic and Recycling assays on deadhering 1069 Endocytic assays were done as previously described 28 , 33 with slight modifications as 1070 required . Briefly , CG endocytosis was monitored using fluorescent dextran at 1mg / ml 1071 in medium or fluorescent folate analogue ( N \u03b1 - pteroyl - N \u025b - Bodipy TMR - L - lysine 1072 ( PLB TMR ) ) in folate free medium for indicated time points at 37 \u00ba C . Endocytosis of 1073 TfR was monitored using 10 \u00b5g / ml fluorescent transferrin ( Tf ) at 37 \u00ba C incubation for 1074 indicated time points . Endocytosis was stopped using ice cold HEPES based 1075 buffer ( M1 ) ( M1 : 140mM NaCl , 20mM HEPES , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 5mM KCl , 1076 pH 7 . 4 ) . To remove surface fluorescence , cells were treated with PI - PLC ( 50\u03bcg / ml , 1077 1h ; GPI - APs ) or with ascorbate buffer ( 160mM sodium ascorbate , 40mM ascorbic 1078 acid , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , pH 4 . 5 ; Tf ) at 4 \u00ba C and subsequently fixed with 4 % 1079 paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes . 1080 To study endocytosis on deadhering , cells were detached using TrypLE containing 1081 fluorescent dextran at 1mg / ml concentration for 3 minutes and the detached cells were 1082 pipetted into an ice cold vial containing M1 buffer to stop the endocytosis . Cells were 1083 then replated back on coverslip bottom dish maintained at 4 \u00ba C , fixed , washed and 1084 imaged . To look at endocytosis in suspension , the cells soon after detaching were 1085 pipetted into vial containing fluorescent dextran kept at 37 \u00ba C . The volume was 1086 adjusted to have a final concentration of 1mg / ml of the TMR - Dex and after 3minutes 1087 the endocytosis was stopped by shifting vial to ice . The cells are spun down at 4 \u00ba C 1088 and then re - plated on coverslip bottom dish coated with ConA , maintained at 4 o C , 1089 fixed , washed and imaged . 1090 .

Cells were then re - plated back on coverslip bottom dish coated with 1094 ConA maintained at 4 \u00ba C , fixed , washed and imaged . 1095 For different small molecule inhibitors used , the cells were treated with them for 30 1096 minutes in serum free media in their respective final concentrations and then medium 1097 was removed and pulsed with F - Dex at 1mg / ml in serum free media containing the 1098 inhibitors since the inhibitor activity is reversible . Endocytosis is stopped by washing 1099 with ice cold M1 buffer , fixed and imaged . 1100 CTxB - HRP uptake , DAB reaction and Electron Microscopy 1101 WT and Cav - / - MEFs were de - adhered at room temperature followed by 1102 internalization of 4 \u00b5g . ml - 1 CTxB - HRP ( Invitrogen ) at 37 \u00ba C for 5 minutes , washed 1103 two times with ice cold PBS followed by incubation on ice for 10 minutes with 1104 1mg . ml - 1 DAB ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with 50\u00b5M Ascorbic acid . This is followed by a 10 1105 minute treatment with DAB , Ascorbic acid and 0 . 012 % H 2 O 2 and then washed twice 1106 with ice cold PBS . Cells were fixed using 2 . 5 % Glutaraldehyde ( ProSciTech ) at room 1107 temperature ( RT ) for 1 hour followed by PBS wash for two times and then washed 1108 with 0 . 1M Na cacodylate and left in the same for overnight at 4 \u00ba C . Cells were 1109 contrasted with 1 % osmium tetroxide and 4 % uranyl acetate . Cells were dehydrated in 1110 successive washes of 70 % , 90 % and 100 % ethanol before embedding using 100 % 1111 LX - 112 resin at 60 o C overnight . Sections were viewed under a transmission electron 1112 microscope ( JEOL 1011 ; JEOL Ltd . Tokyo , Japan ) , and electron micrographs were 1113 captured with a digital camera ( Morada ; Olympus ) using AnalySIS software 1114 ( Olympus ) . 1115 Preparation of PDMS membrane ring 1116 Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit comes in two parts which are added in 10 to 1 mix 1117 ratio between the polydimethylsiloxane base and the curing agent . This is thoroughly 1118 mixed and degassing is done either using a vacuum desiccator or by centrifugation . 1119 To prepare PDMS sheets , 7ml of this mixture was added to the middle of a circular 1120 6inch plate which is spun at 500R . P . M for a minute on a spin coater . This was cured 1121 at 65 \u00ba C overnight and then carefully peeled off either after treatment with oxygen 1122 plasma cleaner for 40 seconds or without treatment . This PDMS sheet is spread 1123 evenly and tightly placed between rings of the stretcher ( Fig 1a ) . The cells were 1124 plated in the middle of the PDMS sheet surrounded with water soaked tissue paper to 1125 retain humidity and prevent drying up of medium . These rings were placed in the 1126 stretcher and stretched by varying the level of vacuum as needed according to the 1127 calibration for the experiments . 1128 Stretch and osmolarity experiments 1129 For the stretch relax experiments , cells plated on PDMS membrane were loaded on 1130 the cell stretcher system ( Fig 1a ) within a temperature controlled chamber at 37 \u00ba C . 1131 Vacuum was applied beneath the ring containing the PDMS sheet , deforming the 1132 membrane and stretching the cells plated on the PDMS . The setup was calibrated to 1133 stretch cells equi - biaxially to cause 6 % strain . Medium containing F - Dex was kept at 1134 .

Control cells were treated in the same 1136 way except for application of stretch . 1137 For the osmolarity experiments , cells were treated with 50 % hypotonic medium made 1138 with deionized water at 37 \u00ba C for the indicated time points and then pulsed with F - Dex 1139 either in hypotonic or isotonic medium as needed . The shock is applied for 60 seconds 1140 and pulse done for 60 seconds as mentioned . Endocytosis was stopped with ice cold 1141 M1 buffer , washed , fixed and imaged . 1142 Optical Tweezer measurements 1143 Tether forces was measured using an custom built optical tweezer using IR laser 1144 ( CW , 1064nm , TEM _ 00 , 1W ) along with 100x , 1 . 3NA oil objective and motorized 1145 stage on a Olympus IX71 inverted microscope . Polystyrene beads added to the 1146 imaging chamber were allowed to settle and then held in the optical trap while 1147 simultaneously imaging through bright field on a coolsnap HQ CCD camera . 1148 Membrane tethers are formed by attaching the beads to the cells for few seconds and 1149 by moving the bead away using the piezo stage . The tether is held at a constant length 1150 and the fluctuation in the trapped bead is detected by using a quadrant photodiode 1151 which in turn is acquired and saved using a Labview program through a Data 1152 Acquisition Card ( USB - 6009 NI ) . The trap stiffness is calibrated using the power 1153 spectrum method . The displacement of the bead from the center along with the trap 1154 stiffness is used to calculate the tether forces live using a custom written Labview 1155 code . 1156 Magnetic Tweezer measurements 1157 Magnetic tweezer measurements were carried out as previously described 59 . Briefly , a 1158 custom - built electromagnet with a sharpened tip was used to apply a 0 . 5 nN pulsatory 1159 force ( 1 Hz ) to paramagnetic beads attached to cells . Paramagnetic beads had been 1160 previously coated with either the fibronectin fragment FN7 - 10 or concanavalin A 1161 ( Sigma Aldrich ) , which bind respectively specifically to integrins and the actin 1162 cytoskeleton or nonspecifically to the membrane through glycoproteins 60 . Bead 1163 movement in response to applied force was then tracked , and bead stiffness was 1164 calculated during the first 10 seconds of the measurement as the transfer function 1165 between the applied force and the resulting displacement , evaluated at 1 Hz . This 1166 stiffness thus provides a measure of the resistance to force of the cell - bead adhesion 1167 in units of nN / \u00b5m . 1168 Synthesis of LG186 1169 LG186 was synthesized freshly prior to experiments as reported previously 36 with 1170 slight modification as described below and used at 10\u00b5M dissolved in DMSO . . 1171 .

For the stretch 1212 experiments , an upright microscope ( Nikon eclipse Ni \u2013 U ) was used with a water 1213 immersion objective ( 60x , 1 . 0 NA ) . Different fields were obtained and cells within 1214 the field were outlined as regions using either metamorph or micromanager software . 1215 The images were analyzed using MetaMorph \u00ae or Micro - Manager software and is 1216 processed for presentation using Adobe Illustrator . All images displayed are equally 1217 scaled for intensity unless otherwise mentioned . The scale bar is 10\u03bcm unless 1218 otherwise mentioned . The integrated intensities , spread area and thus average uptake 1219 per cell were determined using the region measurement option . Each value plotted 1220 here is mean value from two different experiments with duplicates in each and 1221 standard deviation between the two experiments . Statistical significance was tested 1222 using Mann - Whitney test and p - values are reported . 1223 .

Louis , Missouri 63130 2 Received 7 June 2002 / Returned for modi\ufb01cation 3 July 2002 / Accepted 6 December 2002 The actin cytoskeleton is believed to contribute to the formation of clathrin - coated pits , although the speci\ufb01c components that connect actin \ufb01laments with the endocytic machinery are unclear . Cortactin is an F - actin - associated protein , localizes within membrane ruf\ufb02es in cultured cells , and is a direct binding partner of the large GTPase dynamin . This direct interaction with a component of the endocytic machinery suggests that cortactin may participate in one or several endocytic processes . Therefore , the goal of this study was to test whether cortactin associates with clathrin - coated pits and participates in receptor - mediated endocytosis . Morphological experiments with either anti - cortactin antibodies or expressed red \ufb02uorescence protein - tagged cortactin revealed a striking colocalization of cortactin and clathrin puncta at the ventral plasma membrane . Consistent with these observations , cells microinjected with these antibodies exhibited a marked decrease in the uptake of labeled transferrin and low - density lipoprotein while internalization of the \ufb02uid marker dextran was unchanged . Cells expressing the cortactin Src homology three domain also exhibited markedly reduced endocytosis . These \ufb01ndings suggest that cortactin is an important component of the receptor - mediated endo - cytic machinery , where , together with actin and dynamin , it regulates the scission of clathrin pits from the plasma membrane . Thus , cortactin provides a direct link between the dynamic actin cytoskeleton and the membrane pinchase dynamin that supports vesicle formation during receptor - mediated endocytosis . The actin cytoskeleton , with its associated proteins , has been implicated in endocytic processes in both yeast and mamma - lian cells ( 5 , 25 , 41 ) . How this cytoskeletal network might interact with the endocytic machinery to regulate vesicle for - mation and scission remains unclear . Recently , Pelkmans and colleagues reported that actin and dynamin accumulated at simian virus 40 - docked caveolae concomitant with internaliza - tion , thus demonstrating that actin functions during the endo - cytic process ( 24 ) . Similarly , Merri\ufb01eld et al . demonstrated that clathrin , dynamin , and actin are sequentially recruited to form clathrin pits , marked by an accumulation of actin and movement of the vesicles away from the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . Both of these studies demonstrated an accumulation of dynamin and actin at the forming endocytic membranes but did not directly link the endocytic and cytoskeletal machiner - ies . Recently , it was demonstrated that the actin - binding pro - tein cortactin associates directly with the large GTPase dy - namin ( Dyn2 ) via their Src homology three ( SH3 ) and proline - rich domains ( PRD ) , respectively ( 19 ) . As Dyn2 participates in the liberation of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) from the plasma membrane , a potential link exists between the endocytic ma - chinery and the actin cytoskeleton through cortactin ( 18 ) . Cortactin is an 80 - and 85 - kDa protein that localizes within membrane ruf\ufb02es in cultured cells ( 19 , 43 ) and was originally identi\ufb01ed as a substrate for the protein tyrosine kinase pp60Src ( 21 , 44 ) . Importantly , cortactin contains an N - terminal acidic region that , through the three - amino - acid DDW motif , binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex , where it appears to regulate actin polymerization ( 36 , 39 , 40 ) . Cortactin also contains tandem repeats that form F - actin - binding domains ( 41 , 43 ) and an (cid:2) - helical proline - rich region that includes tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by c - Src ( 12 , 13 ) . These unique fea - tures make it likely that cortactin participates in numerous actin - dependent cytoskeletal processes . For example , the ob - servations that cortactin is localized to cortical ruf\ufb02es and that cells expressing high levels of cortactin have enhanced cell motility suggests that cortactin functions together with actin to promote cell motility ( 23 , 43 ) . However , recent studies have reported that cortactin associates with motile endosomes and have implicated this protein in actin nucleation as it may relate to vesicle transport , targeting , or fusion ( 14 , 16 , 22 , 29 ) . A recent study reporting a direct binding of Dyn2 and cortactin was one of the \ufb01rst to demonstrate a physical interaction be - tween an actin - binding protein and a component of the endo - cytic machinery ( 19 ) . Whether cortactin participates in endo - cytosis is currently unde\ufb01ned . In this study we tested whether cortactin functions during the initial stages of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) . Speci\ufb01cally , we asked whether cortactin , normally found at the cell cortex , might also associate with CCPs . Dyn2 mutants that alter RME were used to gain insight into the function and targeting of cortactin to CCPs . The role of cortactin in endo - cytosis was tested directly through microinjection of af\ufb01nity - puri\ufb01ed antibodies to distinct domains of cortactin , including the dynamin - binding SH3 domain , and by transient expression of the SH3 domain .

A striking colocalization of cortactin was observed with both clathrin and Dyn2 puncta on the cell surface by using two distinct cortactin antibodies and red \ufb02uorescence protein - tagged cortactin ( cortactin - RFP ) . Further , when RME and clathrin organization was disrupted through the expression of Dyn2 mutant proteins , cortactin redistributed to localize with clathrin in large surface plaques . In support of these \ufb01ndings , microinjection of the same anti - bodies used for colocalization and expression of the cortactin SH3 domain resulted in a substantial inhibition of clathrin - mediated transferrin and LDL uptake while \ufb02uid uptake re - mained unaffected . These \ufb01ndings demonstrate a role for cor - tactin at the site of endocytic pit formation and scission . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies , ligands , and stains . An anticlathrin monoclonal antibody ( X - 22 ) was from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , Md . The anti - kinesin ( MC44 ) antibody was raised against a peptide sequence representing amino acids QKKLSGKLYLVDLAGSEKVSKTGAEGT . The anti - cortactin AB3 antibody was raised against the peptide DKSAVGFDYQGKTEKHESQKDYSK , present in the third F - actin - binding domain , and the anti - cortactin C - Tyr antibody was raised against the peptide HYQAEDDTYDGYESDLGIT , present in the C - terminal region of cortactin . The anti - cortactin SH3 antibody was raised against the peptide YDYQAAGDDEISFDPDDVITNIEM , present in the SH3 domain of cortactin . The cortactin antibodies are speci\ufb01c , as con\ufb01rmed by immunoblot - ting and immuno\ufb02uorescence analysis compared to a commercially available monoclonal cortactin antibody 4F11 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , N . Y . ) . Goat anti - rabbit or goat anti - mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 or 594 were from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , Oreg . ) . Transferrin Alexa 488 or 594 , DiI - LDL , and rhodamine - or FITC - dextran ( 3 , 000 molecular weight ) for immunocytochemical staining were from Molecular Probes . All other chemicals and reagents , unless otherwise stated , were from Sigma ( St . Louis , Mo . ) . Dynamin and cortactin cDNAs . The Dyn2 ( aa ) K44A - GFP and Dyn2 ( amino acid ) (cid:3) PRD - GFP plasmids were as described previously ( 3 , 19 ) . Oligonucleotide primers speci\ufb01c for cortactin were designed ( MacVector or Oligo , version 6 . 51 ) and synthesized ( Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA / RNA synthesizer ) by using the cortactin cDNA sequence from GenBank ( accession no . AF054619 ) . Primers designed for cortactin are Cort 5 (cid:4) ( ATGTGGAAAGCCTCTGCAGG CCATGCTGTG ) and Cort 3 (cid:4) , ( CTACTGCCGCAGC TCCACATAG ) . Full - length cDNAs were ampli\ufb01ed by using the XL PCR kit ( Perkin Elmer , Branch - burg , N . J . ) . The PCR cycle conditions were 94\u00b0C for 1 min and 62\u00b0C for 5 min for 28 cycles followed by 72\u00b0C for 7 min . The cortactin SH3 domain was ampli\ufb01ed by using a PCR kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , Calif . ) . Primers designed for the cortactin SH3 domain were SH3 - 5 (cid:4) ( ATGTATGACTACCAGGCTGCTGGCG ATG ) and the 3 (cid:4) primer Cort 3 (cid:4) . The cortactin full - length DNA template was used in the PCR ; cycle conditions were as described above for 30 cycles . The PCR fragments were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3 . 1 ( In - vitrogen ) . For subcloning , positive pCR3 . 1 subclones were subjected to PCR with 5 (cid:4) and 3 (cid:4) PCR primers for cortactin that introduced novel restriction enzyme sites ( Eco RI and Bam HI ) . Ampli\ufb01cation products containing the Eco RI and Bam HI restriction sites were digested and subcloned into the pDsRed - N 1 ( RFP ) expression vector ( Clontech , Palo Alto , Calif . ) . Restriction enzymes were from Promega ( Madison , Wis . ) and Life Technologies , Inc . ( Invitrogen ) . Cell culture and transfection . Clone 9 cells , an epithelial cell line isolated from normal rat liver ( ATCC CRL - 1439 ) , were maintained in Ham\u2019s F - 12K medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) , 100 U of penicillin / ml , and 100 (cid:5) g of streptomycin / ml in 5 % CO 2 \u2013 95 % air at 37\u00b0C . Cells were cultured in T - 75 \ufb02asks ( Fisher Scienti\ufb01c , Pittsburgh , Pa . ) or on 22 - by 22 - mm glass coverslips for transfections and immunocytochemistry , respectively . Transfec - tions were performed with the Lipofectamine Plus reagent kit ( Invitrogen ) . Immuno\ufb02uorescence and confocal microscopy . For immuno\ufb02uorescence mi - croscopy and confocal microscopy , cells were grown on coverslips for 1 to 2 days and prepared as described previously ( 2 ) . Clone 9 cells were double stained with anti - cortactin ( AB3 ) polyclonal antibody or anti - cortactin ( C - Tyr ) polyclonal antibody with clathrin ( X - 22 ) monoclonal antibody . Transiently transfected cor - tactin - RFP - expressing cells were also costained with clathrin ( X - 22 ) . The anti - cortactin and anti - SH3 antibodies were used to identify the Cort SH3 - pCR3 . 1 - expressing cells . For the transferrin uptake experiments , the cells were permeabilized with 0 . 01 % digitonin ( Fluka , Ronkonkoma , N . Y . ) . Cells were viewed with an Axiovert 35 epi\ufb02uorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thorn - wood , N . Y . ) equipped with a 100 - W mercury lamp and a 100 (cid:6) objective lens ( Zeiss Plan - Neo\ufb02uar 1 . 30 ) and a confocal microscope ( LSM - 310 or 510 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) equipped with an argon \u2013 krypton laser and a 100 (cid:6) objective lens . Electron microscopy . Electron microscopy of replica coated , unroofed COS7 cells and labeling with anti - cortactin antibodies were performed as described previously by J . Heuser ( 9 , 10 ) . Microinjection of anti - cortactin and kinesin antibodies and endocytic assays . Clone 9 cells were microinjected with either buffer alone ( 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 [ pH 7 . 2 ] and 75 mM KCl ) or buffer containing cortactin ( AB3 , 6 . 2 mg / ml ) , cortactin ( C - Tyr , 9 . 4 mg / ml ) , or anti - kinesin ( 7 . 2 mg / ml ) antibodies , respectively . Fixable rhodamine - or FITC - dextrans were included in the injectate to identify the injected cells . The cells recovered in 5 % CO 2 \u2013 95 % air at 37\u00b0C for 4 to 6 h prior to the endocytic assays ( 8 ) . Quantitation of transferrin , LDL , and dextran uptake in microinjected cells . Images for quantitation were acquired by using a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics SenSys , Tuscon , Ariz . ) driven by Metamorph ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , Pa . ) . All images of microinjected cells were taken at full resolution ( 1 , 024 by 1 , 024 pixels ) with the same acquisition settings ( exposure time , 5 s ; 12 - bit grayscale ) . The percentage of cells demonstrating an inhibition of transferrin or dextran uptake was determined by visual inspection . The mean percentage of cells showing reduced internalization was determined from three separate experiments and at least 150 cells for each condition . Fluorescence intensity quantitation was performed with IPLab ( Scanalytics , Inc . , Fairfax , Va . ) . The area occupied by each cell was traced , and the mean \ufb02uorescence intensity per unit area was determined for at least 100 cells in each injection condition . RESULTS Cortactin localizes to CCPs in cultured cells . As novel cor - tactin antibodies were generated for this study , we \ufb01rst needed to demonstrate their speci\ufb01city . Polyclonal antibodies against cortactin peptides were raised to distinct epitopes in cortactin , the third actin - binding motif ( AB3 ) near the center of the protein , and a C - terminal region adjacent to the SH3 domain known to contain several Src - phosphorylated tyrosines ( C - Tyr ) ( Fig . 1a ) ( 12 , 13 ) . After puri\ufb01cation and concentration , these antibodies were characterized by using multiple criteria and their speci\ufb01cities were compared to a commercially available cortactin monoclonal antibody ( see Materials and Methods ) . First , immunoblotting of liver homogenate , cultured rat hepa - tocyte ( clone 9 ) lysate , and puri\ufb01ed His 6 - cortactin protein demonstrated that all three antibodies speci\ufb01cally detected the characteristic cortactin doublet at 80 and 85 kDa ( Fig . 1b ) . Next , we used these three antibodies to immunoprecipitate cortactin from clone 9 lysate . Immunoblotting of the respective immunoprecipitations with the monoclonal antibody revealed that a substantial amount of cortactin was isolated ( Fig . 1c ) . Importantly , when these immunoprecipitations were subjected to Coomassie blue staining ( silver staining was also performed ) ( data not shown ) , cortactin represented the overwhelming ma - jority of the protein present ( Fig . 1d ) . These experiments dem - onstrated that the three distinct antibody reagents used in this study are speci\ufb01c for cortactin . To de\ufb01ne the localization and function of cortactin in cul - tured clone cells , the puri\ufb01ed cortactin antibodies were used for indirect immuno\ufb02uorescence staining ( Fig . 2a and b ) . Both antibodies gave nearly identical staining patterns , stained the cell cortex , as reported previously ( 19 , 40 , 43 ) , and also labeled prominent , punctate foci along the cell surface . Costaining of these cells with monoclonal antibodies to the clathrin heavy chain , or Dyn2 ( data not shown ) , demonstrated a striking , but not absolute , colocalization of these proteins at plasma mem - V OL . 23 , 2003 CORTACTIN , A COMPONENT OF CCPs , PARTICIPATES IN RME 2163 brane puncta ( Fig . 2a to b (cid:7) ) . To further con\ufb01rm these antibody localization results , clone 9 cells expressing a cortactin - RFP fusion protein ( Cort - B - pDsRed - N 1 ) were \ufb01xed and stained with antibodies to clathrin ( Fig . 2c to c (cid:7) ) or Dyn2 ( data not shown ) . As for the antibody - stained cells , the expressed cor - tactin - RFP localized to the cell cortices and in small puncta along the cell surface that stained positive for both clathrin and Dyn2 . A majority , but not all , of the tagged cortactin protein associated with clathrin foci ( Fig . 2c (cid:7) ) . To visualize cortactin\u2019s localization at the ultrastructural level and gain insight into its potential function at CCPs , un - roofed preparations of cultured COS7 cells were processed for immuno - gold electron microscopy with the AB3 or C - Tyr cor - tactin antibodies by using the methods of Heuser ( 9 , 10 ) . This preparation allows high - resolution imaging of immuno - gold complexes while maintaining remarkable morphological pres - ervation of coat and cytoskeletal components along the cell cortex at the plasma membrane . In support of the \ufb02uorescence microscopy images shown in Fig . 2a to c (cid:7) , the immuno - gold electron microscopy wtih cortactin antibodies revealed a strong labeling of both \ufb02at and highly curved clathrin lattices ( Fig . 2d to f ) . Interestingly , gold particles appeared to be distributed randomly over the surface of \ufb02at clathrin lattices , but this distribution became restricted to a ring around the base of the clathrin coat as the pit invaginated ( Fig . 2d versus e and f ) . This circular distribution along the base of protruding pits closely resembled that of Dyn2 as viewed in the same preparation ( data not shown ) . Importantly , the cortactin antibodies also labeled actin \ufb01laments in these preparations ( Fig . 2d to e ) . Thus , two different puri\ufb01ed antibodies directed to distinct mo - tifs in the cortactin protein , as well as cortactin - RFP , showed signi\ufb01cant localization , with CCPs at both the light and ultra - structural levels . These morphological \ufb01ndings strongly sup - ported a potential role for cortactin in RME together with actin and dynamin . To further con\ufb01rm that cortactin is a component of CCPs and to elucidate the role of cortactin together with Dyn2 at CCPs , we disrupted the normal punctate distribution of clath - rin in cultured cells via expression of mutant Dyn2 proteins . The GTP - binding and hydrolysis - de\ufb01cient Dyn2K44A is often used to block RME , and its expression is proposed to block pits at the intermediate stage of internalization , prior to \ufb01nal con - striction of the vesicle neck ( 4 , 11 , 37 ) . Dynamin that lacks the PRD , Dyn2 (cid:3) PRD , has a diffuse , largely cytoplasmic staining pattern , cannot bind to cortactin ( 19 ) , and was recently shown not to target to CCPs , resulting in blocked RME ( 32 ) . Dyn2 (cid:3) PRD is proposed to exert its dominant - negative effect by inappropriately targeting in cells and through oligomeriza - tion with endogenous dynamin ( 19 , 32 ) . Interestingly , when Dyn2K44A - or Dyn2 (cid:3) PRD - expressing cells ( data not shown ) were stained for cortactin and clathrin , the distribution of plasma membrane cortactin changed to become part of the large , abnormal clathrin aggregates ( Fig . 3 ) . The fact that cor - tactin localization changed along with CCP formation and dis - tribution supports the morphological observations shown in Fig . 2 , indicating that the actin - binding protein cortactin is part of the clathrin endocytic machinery . Cortactin , including its SH3 domain , is important for ef\ufb01 - cient RME . To directly test the role of cortactin in endocytosis , the same af\ufb01nity - puri\ufb01ed antibodies used to show a localiza - tion of cortactin to CCPs ( Fig . 2 ) were microinjected into clone 9 cells . First , we demonstrated that the injected cells did not display any gross morphological defects compared to nonin - jected , buffer - injected , or kinesin antibody - injected cells ( Fig . 4 and data not shown ) . This suggested that the cells were healthy in the context of these experiments . Based on cortactin\u2019s lo - calization to CCPs , we expected that an antibody - mediated inhibition of cortactin function could have profound effects on RME . To test if the cortactin antibodies that colocalize with CCPs might affect clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin or LDL or \ufb02uid - phase endocytosis of dextran , cells were in - jected with control solutions ( microinjection buffer alone or a kinesin antibody ) or af\ufb01nity - puri\ufb01ed cortactin antibodies . In - jected cells recovered for 4 h prior to incubation with \ufb02uores - cent ligands . Subsequent to rinsing and \ufb01xation , cells were scored in a blind fashion as normal or signi\ufb01cantly inhibited for endocytosis . While buffer alone ( data not shown ) or the puri - \ufb01ed kinesin antibody had no effect on transferrin uptake ( Fig . 4a ) , both the cortactin AB3 and C - Tyr antibodies exhibited a profound inhibitory effect on ligand uptake ( Fig . 4b and c ) . In over 80 % ( AB3 - injected ) and 70 % ( C - Tyr - injected ) of the cells counted , transferrin internalization appeared completely ab - lated ( Fig . 4e ) . Interestingly , while transferrin staining in con - FIG . 1 . Polyclonal antibodies raised against distinct cortactin pep - tides appear speci\ufb01c for the cortactin protein .

Areas that peptide antibodies were directed against are indicated ( asterisks ) . To test the speci\ufb01city of the antibodies , peptide af\ufb01nity - puri\ufb01ed serum was used for immunoblot - ting and immunoprecipitation . ( b ) An equal mass of total lysate from rat liver homogenate , cultured hepatocyte ( clone 9 [ C9 ] ) lysate , or puri\ufb01ed His 6 - cortactin ( Cort ) were immunoblotted with either the AB3 , C - Tyr ( C - Y ) , or a commercially available cortactin monoclonal antibody ( 4F11 [ F11 ] ; Upstate Biotechnology ) . The polyclonal anti - cortactin antibodies and the 4F11 antibody speci\ufb01cally detected cor - tactin in all conditions . ( c ) Cortactin was immunoprecipitated ( IP ) from clone 9 lysates with each antibody , and the precipitated protein was immunoblotted with the 4F11 antibody . All cortactin antibodies tested precipitated cortactin that was easily detected by immunoblot - ting . ( d ) Coomassie staining of the immunoprecipitation reactions demonstrated that a substantial amount of cortactin was obtained and that it was the major protein species present ( compare the bands from the immunoprecipitations against 0 . 2 (cid:5) g of puri\ufb01ed His 6 - cortactin [ Cort ] ) .

V OL . 23 , 2003 CORTACTIN , A COMPONENT OF CCPs , PARTICIPATES IN RME 2165 trol cells was distributed as clustered small puncta near the nucleus and plasma membrane , some cortactin antibody - in - jected cells ( 20 to 30 % ) displayed a substantial , but not com - plete , decrease in staining intensity at both locations ( data not shown ) . Thus , we elected to digitally quantify the mean \ufb02uo - rescence intensity per unit area of internalized transferrin in these inhibited cells . While microinjection of buffer alone or kinesin antibody did not result in decreased transferrin inten - sity , the cortactin antibody - injected cells that showed partial inhibition were on average only 40 % as intense as control , noninjected cells ( Fig . 4f ) . Consistent with the transferrin in - ternalization experiments , the RME of LDL was also affected . Microinjection of the same cortactin antibodies resulted in a block of LDL internalization in the majority of cells ( Fig . 5a , a (cid:4) , and c ) . Upon quantitation of the mean \ufb02uorescence inten - sity of LDL in these cells , there was a 40 to 50 % decrease in internalization compared to control ( Fig . 5d ) . These results , together with the cells that appeared to be completely blocked in each condition , indicated that the cortactin antibodies po - tently inhibited the internalization of transferrin and LDL . In contrast , cortactin antibody - injected cells showed no reduction in the ability to internalize \ufb02uid markers , such as \ufb02uorescent dextran ( Fig . 6 ) . In an attempt to further de\ufb01ne how cortactin may mediate RME , we transiently expressed the cortactin SH3 domain in cells . We rationalized that the expressed SH3 domain could competitively inhibit RME by interfering with the normal func - tion of cortactin and interactions with its binding partners , such as dynamin . Mainly , expression of the SH3 domain produced cell phenotypes strikingly similar to those observed in the an - tibody microinjection experiments and signi\ufb01cantly reduced the uptake of transferrin ( Fig . 4d , e , and g ) , and LDL ( Fig . 5b , b (cid:4) , e , and f ) . Importantly , expression of full - length cortactin in these same experiments had no signi\ufb01cant effects on RME ( Fig . 4e and g and 5e and f ) . These results suggested that the SH3 domain of cortactin has an important role in linking cortactin and / or dynamin to the functional endocytic complex . DISCUSSION In this study we demonstrate a structural and functional association between the actin - binding protein cortactin and CCPs in cultured epithelial cells . This study was initiated based on previously published data that the SH3 domain of cortactin binds to the proline - rich tail of Dyn2 ( 19 ) . While this earlier study demonstrated a convincing codistribution of these pro - teins in peripheral membrane ruf\ufb02es , it was unclear if an as - sociation occurred at the site of RME . Because dynamin func - tions during the endocytic process , it prompted us to test if cortactin and Dyn2 interactions are required to support invag - ination of the plasma membrane and subsequent internaliza - tion of ligand . Several morphological techniques demonstrated a convincing colocalization between cortactin , Dyn2 , and clath - rin . The methods used in this study included immuno\ufb02uores - cence cell staining with two polyclonal antibodies made to distinct cortactin domains ( Fig . 2 ) , expression of RFP - tagged cortactin protein ( Fig . 2 ) , and high - resolution immuno - gold electron microscopy with the same antibodies ( Fig . 2 ) . All three of these methods were supportive of each other and consistently localized cortactin to CCPs . Interestingly , the elec - tron micrographs showed that at initial steps of invagination , cortactin localized throughout \ufb02at clathrin lattices . At later stages , the cortactin was primarily located in a ring or collar around the neck of the pit , with some occasionally remaining at FIG . 3 . Inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cells expressing GTPase - de\ufb01cient Dyn2 results in an abnormal distribution of both cortactin and clathrin . Clone 9 cells transiently expressing GTPase - de\ufb01cient Dyn2K44A - GFP were \ufb01xed and labeled to visualize the clathrin ( X - 22 monoclonal antibody ) and cortactin ( C - Tyr ) . ( a to a (cid:7) ) Cells expressing the Dyn2 mutant ( asterisks ) have numerous clustered and clumpy - looking clathrin pits ( a (cid:4) and b (cid:4) , arrows ) in comparison to neighboring nontransfected cells . The defective clathrin staining dramatically colocalized with cortactin ( a (cid:7) and b (cid:7) , arrows ) . Bar (cid:8) 10 (cid:5) m . 2166 CAO ET AL . M OL . C ELL . B IOL . the bulb of the invaginating pit . This is not unlike what we and others have observed for dynamin ( 4 , 33 ) . Exactly why some of the cortactin and Dyn2 remain associated with the bulb of the pit is unclear , but perhaps part of this complex is a remnant of the protein associated with the \ufb02at clathrin lattice prior to curvature or is providing nucleation sites for actin \ufb01laments to push the vesicle from the plasma membrane . Consistent with the localization studies , the same antibody reagents exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on cell function . Both antibodies signi\ufb01cantly inhibited RME of transferrin and LDL but not the uptake of \ufb02uid markers ( Fig . 4 , 5 , and 6 ) . As multiple laboratories have observed different requirements for dynamin in \ufb02uid - phase internalization ( 6 , 16 , 22 ) , it was un - clear if cortactin would be required in this process or not . One possibility is that cortactin\u2019s role in \ufb02uid - phase endocytosis is not during internalization but rather during postendocytic traf - \ufb01cking and movement via actin polymerization , as has been observed for both cortactin and Dyn2 ( 14 , 16 , 22 ) . It is likely that cortactin is associated with actin micro\ufb01laments in close proximity to the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 2d to f ) . Actin micro\ufb01la - ments are thought to function during early stages of pit invag - ination and to organize pit assemblies that aid in nascent ves - icle \ufb01ssion from the plasma membrane ( 26 , 28 ) . Cortactin\u2019s proposed function as a protein that enhances micro\ufb01lament nucleation via the Arp2 / 3 complex and stabilizes actin \ufb01la - ments and branches supports such a function for cortactin in RME . Further , recent data demonstrating cortactin\u2019s role to - gether with Dyn2 in other actin - dependent membrane pro - cesses supports the hypothesis that cortactin and Dyn2 func - tion together with actin to mediate vesicle formation . The action of such a complex could be coordinated by integration with a host of proteins . The Dyn2 polymer , along with cortac - tin , could form a complex meshwork comprised of multiple actin - binding proteins including pro\ufb01lin ( 42 ) , Abp1 ( 15 ) , syn - dapin ( 25 ) , N - WASp ( 35 ) ; structural coat proteins such as amphiphysin ( 7 ) , AP2 ( 38 ) , and clathrin ( 34 ) ; and signaling molecules including PIP2 ( 17 , 45 ) , phospholipase C - (cid:9) ( 31 ) , and Src ( 1 , 5 ) . The cortactin SH3 domain expression experiments demonstrate that the SH3 domain of cortactin is important for RME . It is attractive to predict that cortactin\u2019s SH3 domain is binding to dynamin and other putative partners at the forming vesicle . As the injection of cortactin antibodies or expression of multiple truncated cortactin constructs did not inhibit the re - cruitment of Dyn2 to clathrin pits , it is likely that cortactin does not directly recruit Dyn2 to the pit . As there are multiple Dyn2 - binding partners at the endocytic site ( endophilin , inter - sectin , amphiphysin , Grb2 , and AP2 ) ( 18 ) , it is likely that the Dyn2 - cortactin binding contributes to membrane deformation and actin assembly rather than direct recruitment . Finally , dynamin is known to interact with other actin - asso - ciated proteins , including syndapin ( 27 ) , pro\ufb01lin ( 42 ) , and Abp1 ( 15 ) . Abp1 was shown to regulate RME through actin FIG . 4 . Cortactin antibody injection and expression of the SH3 domain signi\ufb01cantly inhibit RME of transferrin .

All injectate solutions contained FITC - dextran to con\ufb01rm successful injections . Injection of kinesin antibody had no effect on the internalization of Alexa 594 - transferrin . ( b and c ) In contrast , cells microinjected with either the AB3 or C - Tyr puri\ufb01ed cortactin antibodies showed signi\ufb01cant inhibition of the RME of Alexa 594 - transferrin .

Signi\ufb01cantly , mammalian Abp1 , unlike cor - tactin , lacks the acidic amino acid residues that mediate direct binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 28 ) . This is an important dis - tinction that increases the inherent importance of the cortac - tin - Dyn2 interaction . Actin nucleation has been suggested to be important for RME , and the fact that cortactin stimulates actin nucleation and that this activity is affected by binding to dynamin ( 30 ) suggests that cortactin may serve a more direct role during RME , rather than functioning as a scaffolding molecule that links actin \ufb01laments and Dyn2 . Interestingly , when cortactin\u2019s binding domain is removed from Dyn2 ( Dyn2 (cid:3) PRD ) , there are alterations in associated actin organi - zation , Dyn2 no longer localizes to CCPs and RME is inhibited ( 19 , 22 , 32 ) . Based on this study , and others , an attractive model predicts that the SH3 domain of cortactin binds to the PRD of Dyn2 at the invaginating CCP . The direct interaction of these two proteins integrates dynamic actin \ufb01laments and the membrane \ufb01ssion machinery , possibly in a Src - sensitive manner . Thus , the actin \ufb01lament - binding and nucleation activ - ity of cortactin and the membrane - modeling activity of Dyn2 may function together during RME to mediate the \ufb01nal scis - sion step of endocytosis . A simpli\ufb01ed model depicting cortactin and dynamin and how they may integrate endocytic proteins at the invaginating pit is shown in Fig . 7 .

Why FCLs and RAs colocalize is not known . Here , we show that RAs are assembled at FCLs in a process controlled by fibronectin ( FN ) and its receptor , integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 . We observed that cells on FN - rich matrices displayed fewer FCLs and RAs . CME machinery inhibition abolished RAs and live - cell imaging showed that RA establishment requires FCL coassembly . The inhibitory activity of FN was mediated by the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 at Tensin1 - positive fibrillar adhesions . Conventionally , endocytosis disassembles cellular adhesions by internalizing their components . Our results present a novel paradigm in the relationship between these two processes by showing that endocytic proteins can actively function in the assembly of cell adhesions . Furthermore , we show this novel adhesion assembly mechanism is coupled to cell migration via unique crosstalk between cell - matrix adhesions . Introduction Integrins are nonenzymatic dimeric transmembrane receptors that recognize ECM components . These mechanosensory pro - teins govern cell adhesion to the ECM maintaining correct tissue development and function , with elaborate connections to cel - lular homeostasis and disease ( Kanchanawong and Calderwood , 2023 ) . Ligand availability and biochemical and physical prop - erties of the ECM determine integrin activation status , integrin clustering , and , ultimately , the formation of cellular adhesion structures ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Cells can form a variety of integrin - based adhesions . Small integrin clusters engaged to the ECM , called nascent adhesions , form on the cell periphery and establish their connection to the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins such as Talin . A bal - ancing act of traction forces and signaling molecules determines whether nascent adhesions mature into larger and molecularly more complex focal adhesions ( FAs ; Wehrle - Haller , 2012 ) . In migrating cells and in the presence of the ECM component fi - bronectin ( FN ) , FAs can serve as platforms for the formation of fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) , where FN - bound \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 integrins are formed along actin cables as they extend FN fibrils ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ) . Common to all these types of cell adhesions , their disassembly is mediated by the removal of integrin mole - cules from adhesion sites via endocytosis ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Recently , a novel type of integrin - based cell adhesion was discovered ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) . Called reticular adhesions ( RAs ) , these structures contain integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , lack the typical markers for the other adhesion types , such as Talin1 or Paxillin , and are not connected to actin stress fibers . RAs can occupy a significant portion of the substrate - facing surface of cells in culture and can significantly outlast FAs . Their physiological function is , how - ever , not clear . Intriguingly , RAs colocalize with large , persistent forms of clathrin structures at the cell membrane called flat clathrin lattices ( FCLs ; also referred to as clathrin plaques ; Grove et al . , 2014 ) . The structure containing FCLs and RAs is called clathrin - containing adhesion complexes ( CCAC ; Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . FCLs were previously considered stalled endocytic events of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) pathway . However , recent studies have changed this view and support the idea that FCLs are signaling platforms ( Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ; Grove et al . , 2014 ; Alfonzo - M\u00b4endez et al . , 2022 ) .

The functional relationship between FCLs and RAs is not clear . A confounding factor in this relationship lies in the fact that although FCLs always localize to RAs , the opposite is not true . RAs can occur as large structures with FCLs covering only a fraction of their area . Moreover , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 can localize to both RAs and FAs . Although details on the factors mediating integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localization to FCLs are becoming clearer ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) , why these struc - tures co - exist , what their function is , and how cells control their formation remain a mystery . In this study , we show that FCLs are required for the estab - lishment of RAs . Moreover , we found that an FN - rich ECM acts as an inhibitor of RA formation . This inhibitory role of FN is mediated by the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 localized at fibrillar adhesions . Furthermore , we show that the transition from a static to a migratory state is mirrored by the disappearance of FCLs and RAs . Results FN inhibits the formation of FCLs While studying CME dynamics , we serendipitously observed that cells on FN appear to display fewer FCLs when compared with cells plated on non - coated glass dishes . To confirm if ECM proteins in general can influence CME , we assessed the effect of several major ECM components as well as non - ECM coatings and non - coated surfaces on the amount of FCLs . For that , dishes were coated for 16 \u2013 24 h , after which cells were let to attach for 16 \u2013 20 h in serum - containing medium before imaging . For quantifications , we established the metric FCL proportion , which defines the average fraction of FCLs per frame among all clathrin - coated structures detected in a 5 - min movie ( see Ma - terials and methods for details ) . These experiments were per - formed using U2Os cells with an endogenously GFP - tagged \u03b1 adaptin 2 Sigma - Aldrich subunit ( AP2S1 , hereafter referred to simply as AP2 ) . AP2 is a widely used CME marker that faithfully mirrors clathrin dynamics ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2008 ) . We used endoge - nously tagged cell lines throughout this study as the expression level of the AP2 complex was shown to modulate the amount of FCLs ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . U2Os cells on non - coated dishes presented typical and abundant FCLs ( i . e . , bright , long - lived AP2 - GFP marked struc - tures ; Fig . 1 , A and B ; Fig . S1 A ; and Video 1 ) , similar to what has been found in many cell lines ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ; Moulay et al . , 2020 ; Sochacki et al . , 2021 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Simi - larly , U2Os cells plated on dishes coated with the non - ECM proteins BSA and poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) also presented high FCL proportions ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S1 A ; and Video 1 ) . Out of the major ECM proteins tested , FN , collagen IV ( Col IV ) , and laminin - 111 ( LN111 ) reduced FCL proportion significantly . The integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ligand vitronectin ( VTN ) did not increase or decrease the FCL proportion when compared to non - coated dishes ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S1 A ; see Discussion ) . Similarly , and in line with a recent study ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) , collagen I ( Col I ) did not reduce FCLs ( Fig . 1 B , Fig . S1 A , and Video 1 ) . Different concentrations of FN used for coating ( 10 or 20 \u00b5g / ml ) did not show significant differences ( Fig . 1 B ) . Recently , it was described that SCC - 9 cells produce more FN when plated on Col IV or LN111 ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . To probe if this is also the case for our cells , we stained FN from U2Os cells plated directly onto non - coated dishes or plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I , or LN111 . While U2Os cells produce little FN overnight , cells plated on Col IV produced a striking amount of FN , which assembled into elongated fibrils ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . LN111 coating also induced FN production , but less strikingly than Col IV . Col I and VTN coating were unable to stimulate FN production ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . These results suggest that FN is the main ECM com - ponent inhibiting FCL formation . For many cell lines , it is common to find considerable vari - ability in the amount of FCLs in culture . We thus decided to test if this variability is due to differential FN production within the culture . Confirming this hypothesis ( and bearing in mind that U2Os secrete FN modestly ; see below ) , we found that cells plated on non - coated dishes displaying fewer FCLs were predomi - nantly lying on top of an FN - rich region of the culture ( Fig . S1 B ) . Next , we asked if the reduction in FCL proportions observed in FN - coated samples is a cell - wide effect or specific to cellular regions in direct contact with the extracellular substrate . For that , we used patterned dishes containing FN - coated regions interspersed with uncoated regions , where single U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells could adhere simultaneously to both an FN - and a non - coated region . In line with a contact - dependent effect , low FCL proportions were observed in cellular regions in contact with FN whereas FCL proportion was high in cellular regions contacting non - coated surfaces ( Fig . 1 , E \u2013 G , and Video 2 ) . The abundance of an alternative splice variant of the clathrin heavy chain containing exon 31 was recently shown to increase the frequency of clathrin plaques in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We thus tested if the effects we observe are also due to changes in clathrin splicing but found no differences when comparing cells plated on non - coated or FN - coated dishes ( Fig . S1 C ) . Thus , these results show that FN is a potent inhibitor of FCLs . Moreover , FN inhibits FCLs in a contact - dependent man - ner locally within a single cell ( Fig . 1 H ) . FN inhibits the formation of RAs in a similar manner as FCLs As discussed in the introduction , FCLs localize to RAs . To check how ECM composition affects these structures , U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I , or LN111 and stained with the RA component integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and \u2014 to be able to distinguish integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 on RAs or FAs \u2014 were also stained with an FA marker ( p - Pax Y118 ; phosphorylated paxillin ) . Cells plated overnight without coating formed abundant RAs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . On FN - coated dishes , big RAs were largely absent but small \u201c dot - like \u201d nascent RAs were present in a few cells . Similarly , on Col IV and LN111 coatings ( which stimulated FN production ; Fig . 1 C ) , cells formed significantly fewer RAs than on non - coated dishes ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Coating with VTN , the ligand for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 present at RAs and FAs alike ( Fig . S1 C ; Lock et al . , 2018 ) , did not result in more RAs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Dif - ferent coatings also changed the total amount of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

To quantify differences in RA amounts in cells , we developed a metric called RA coverage , which measures the fraction of the area of the cell covered by integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 signal ( excluding FAs ) . RA coverage serves as a good metric to distinguish between large and nascent RAs and , crucially , it shows a clear correspondence between RA content and both FCL proportion and FN abundance in the ECM ( see Fig . 1 , B \u2013 D , and Fig . 2 B ) . Next , we used our substrate patterning strategy to check if the local FN effects on FCLs were also similar for RAs . Strikingly , cells plated on patterned FN revealed that RAs , akin to FCLs , were completely inhibited on cellular regions in contact with FN . Cellular regions in contact with non - coated surfaces displayed many FCLs colocalizing with RAs while regions in contact with FN presented no RAs or FCLs ( Fig . 2 C ) . Interest - ingly , in these patterned substrates , most of the integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 signal segregated to non - coated regions forming typical RAs ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . This contrasts with cells plated in fully coated dishes ( Fig . 2 A ) , where integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 can be seen in both RAs and FAs . Hence , the inhibitory effects of FN on FCLs affect RAs in a similar manner ( Fig . 2 E ) . The effect of FN on FCLs and RAs is clear in various cell lines Next , we checked if the effects we see in U2Os cells are also true for other cell lines . To avoid problems of overexpression , we endogenously tagged AP2 with either Halo tag or GFP in various human cell lines : HeLa ( epithelial , cervical carcinoma ) , MCF7 Figure 2 .

These cell lines presented a large variation in the amount of FCLs and the morphology of RAs . Importantly , these cells could be divided into two groups in terms of endogenous FN secretion , and this division clearly correlated with the amount of FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . U2Os , HeLa , and MCF7 composed the group of low - FN - secretion cells . U2Os form large RAs on non - coated dishes , whereas HeLa formed multiple dot - like nascent RAs ( which colocalized with FCLs ) , with bigger RAs found more seldom ( Fig . 3 A ) . MCF7 cells formed many FCLs and large RAs covering almost the entire cell area ( Fig . 3 A ) . None of the high FN - secreting cell lines ( HDF , Caco2 , and hMEC ) formed large RAs ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . In these high FN - producing cells , small FCL / RA dots were often found in areas with less deposited FN ( Fig . 3 A ) . We next evaluated the response of these cell lines to FN precoating . In low - FN - producing cell lines ( U2Os , HeLa , and MCF7 ) , RA coverage dropped significantly ( Fig . 3 , C \u2013 E ) . Among the high - FN - production cell lines , only Caco2 reduced its RA coverage on FN - coated dishes ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . As expected , HDF and hMEC , which had low RA coverage without coating , did not show a significant response to FN coating ( Fig . 3 , C \u2013 E ) . To evaluate if changes in the amount of RAs are reflected in the amount of FAs , we measure FA coverage ( i . e . , the cellular area covered by FAs ) from U2Os , Hela , and MCF7 . We did not observe any clear difference in the coverage of FAs for these three cell lines plated on uncoated or FN - coated dishes ( Fig . S2 A ) . These results suggest that the dynamics of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 in FAs and RAs are controlled independently . For all experiments so far , we used media supplemented with serum , which is known to contain ECM components , including FN . Given that our cells are left to attach overnight in this media , it would be reasonable to expect that the FN present in serum would coat the dishes and completely mask our results . To test why this does not seem to happen ( Fig . 1 C and Fig . 3 A ) , we compared the amount of FN deposited on the glass surface in different conditions : dishes were coated for 24 h with 10 , 5 , and 1 \u00b5g / ml of FN ( diluted in PBS ) , 100 % FBS , media with 10 % FBS , and PBS as a control . After coating , U2Os cells were plated and left to attach for 16 h before being fixed and stained for FN . Surprisingly , our results revealed that very little FN was de - posited on glass in dishes \u201c coated \u201d with full media or pure FBS ( Fig . S1 , F and G ) . These results are in line with similar ex - periments performed 30 years ago ( Steele et al . , 1992 ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon occurs due to the high concentrations of BSA in serum ( 40 mg / ml ) , which rapidly saturates the surface of culture dishes , thereby acting as a blocking agent for the binding of serum FN . Taken together , the presence of FN controls the formation of RAs and FCLs in a very similar manner and in different cell lines ( Fig . 3 F ) , suggesting a common and general mechanism for the establishment of these structures . The CME machinery is essential for RA formation Next , we set out to dissect the relationship between the for - mation of FCLs and RAs . It has been shown that integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 is required for the establishment of FCLs ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . We confirmed this observation by si - lencing integrin \u03b2 5 from U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes and , indeed , they displayed a significantly lower FCL proportion compared with control cells ( Fig . S2 , B and C ) . Further , while integrin \u03b2 5 - silenced cells were unable to form RAs , they did form FAs ( Fig . S2 , D and E ) . The requirement of integrin \u03b2 5 for FCL formation was further confirmed using Cilengitide , the inhibitor for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ( Desgrosellier and Cheresh , 2010 ) , as the treatment led to a rapid disassembly of FCLs and RAs ( Fig . S2 , F and G ) . While all FCLs colocalize to RAs , FCL - free areas of larger RAs are rather common ( e . g . , Fig . 2 A ; Fig . 3 , A \u2013 C ; and Fig . S2 D ) , which may give the impression that FCLs are formed on pre - existing RAs . Nevertheless , the fact that both structures are inhibited independently by FN suggests a deeper relationship and led us to ask if RAs can exist without the CME machinery . To answer this question , we quantified the RA coverage in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex subunits \u03b1 1 ( AP2A1 ) or Sigma - Aldrich 1 ( AP2S1 ) in cells plated on non - coated dishes , a condition where we observe large RAs . Consistent with an important role played by the CME machinery in RA formation , AP2A1 - or AP2S1 - silenced cells ( easily recog - nizable as cells with little to no AP2 - GFP signal ) did not display RAs . Instead , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localized to FAs ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . To confirm these results , we expressed the AP180 C - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ) , which acts as a strong dominant negative of CME ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . AP180ct - positive U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes displayed low AP2 signal at the membrane and , akin to AP2 - silenced cells , RAs were largely absent with integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localized to FAs , whereas AP180ct - negative cells displayed typical FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Thus , the CME machinery is required for the formation of RAs ( Fig . 4 E ) . Next , we set out to visualize the dynamics of AP2 during RA formation . For that , we generated a double U2Os knock - in cell line AP2 - GFP and integrin \u03b2 5 ( ITGB5 ) - mScarlet . RAs are re - markably stable structures ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) and their de novo formation is rare , making it rather difficult to capture such events . To minimize this challenge , we optimized the conditions for Cilengitide treatment to disassemble RAs followed by a washout , when RAs could start reforming ( Fig . S3 , A and B ) . Using these washout conditions , we were able to capture events showing that the formation and growth of ITGB5 - positive structures are accompanied by the formation of FCLs ( Fig . 5 A ; Fig . S3 , C and D ; and Videos 3 and 4 ) . Also , in events where we could not clearly detect the extension of a mature RA ( reminiscent of the dot - like structures we see in many cells ) , we noticed that the establish - ment of an FCL was typically accompanied by an increase in ITGB5 fluorescence ( Fig . 5 B ; Fig . S3 , C and D ; and Video 3 ) . Importantly , ITGB5 - positive structures , which did not colocalize with an FCL , rapidly disappeared . In many cases , this disappearance was pre - ceded by bona fide CME events ( short lived AP2 - GFP signals ) , likely representing CME - mediated ITGB5 - cluster disassembly ( Fig . 5 B and Fig . S3 D ) . Taken together , our results show that the relationship be - tween FCLs and RAs is beyond a simple colocalization . In fact , Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

S2 ) . The inhibitory effect of FN on FCL and RA formation is mediated by integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 To understand the mechanism controlling the coassembly of FCLs and RAs , we turned our attention back to FN . While in - tegrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 binds to VTN at FAs and RAs , the major FN receptor is integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . First , we acutely interfered with integrin \u03b2 1 binding to FN using the function - blocking antibody mab13 . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells seeded on FN - coated dishes were treated with mab13 and monitored for the acute formation of FCLs and RAs . Over the time course of 45 min , mab13 induced the relocalization of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 from FAs to small , newly formed RAs ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Further sup - porting the role of FCLs in RA assembly , these newly formed RAs completely colocalized with FCLs ( bright AP2 signals ; Fig . 6 , A \u2013 C ) . A similar experiment followed by live - cell imaging con - firmed these results and showed a gradual increase in FCL proportions after mab13 treatment ( Fig . 6 D ) . Mab13 treatment had no effect on existing FCLs and RAs formed on non - coated dishes ( data not shown ) . In line with these results , integrin \u03b2 1 silencing in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN resulted in a high FCL proportion and large , prominent RAs ( Fig . 7 , A \u2013 D , and Fig . S4 , A \u2013 C ) . Despite the striking increase of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 on the bottom surface of si - lenced cells , this increase was not reflected in expression levels , indicating that the stimulation of RA formation leads to a change in the trafficking of this integrin dimer ( Fig . S4 C ) . A significant increase in RAs was also seen in cells silenced for integrin \u03b1 5 , the \u03b1 subunit which pairs with integrin \u03b2 1 for FN binding ( Fig . 7 , C \u2013 E , and Fig . S4 , D and E ) . Taken together , these results show that the inhibitory activity of FN on RAs and FCLs occurs via the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 ( Fig . 7 F ) . Activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 at FBs controls RA and FCL formation When bound to FN , integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 translocates centripetally from FAs to form elongated structures called FBs along actin stress fibers . This movement generates long FN fibrils in a process called FN fibrillogenesis and is mediated by the cytoskeleton scaffolding protein Tensin1 ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ) . To determine Figure 5 .

The staining revealed that in the FN - coated dishes , active integrin \u03b2 1 was colocalizing with FBs ( Tensin1 ; Fig . 8 A ) . As expected , active integrin \u03b2 1 and Tensin1 - positive adhesions were largely absent in non - coated dishes ( Fig . 8 A ) . Next , to determine which active integrin \u03b2 1 pool is more important for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we silenced FAs and FB components on U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells and plated them on FN . In accordance with the higher accumulation of active in - tegrin \u03b2 1 in FBs , silencing of Tensin1 led to a marked increase of RAs and FCLs accompanied by a reduction in the presence of active integrin \u03b2 1 on the membrane ( evidence by 12G10 antibody staining ; Fig . 8 , B and C ; and Fig . S5 , A \u2013 C ) . Silencing of the FA component Talin - 1 also led to increased RAs and FCLs and a reduction of active integrin \u03b2 1 on the membrane ( Fig . S5 , D \u2013 F ) . Given the strong phenotype on Tensin1 knockdown , this result was expected as FAs are precursors of FBs . FB formation indicates activated and migratory cell pheno - types . Indeed , active sliding of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 and Tensin1 bound to FN along central actin stress fibers increases traction forces ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ; Pankov et al . , 2000 ) and is re - quired in cell migration during development and cancer me - tastasis ( Efthymiou et al . , 2020 ; Schwarzbauer and DeSimone , 2011 ) . If the extension of active integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 into FBs is indeed required for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we hypothe - sized that physical confinement of cells \u2014 which inhibits cell migration \u2014 would also inhibit the sliding of FB from FAs . In turn , the absence of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 in FBs would favor FCLs and RAs , even if cells were plated on an FN - rich matrix . To test this possibility , we turned to single - cell micropatterns . In contrast to the patterned coatings we used in Figs . 1 and 2 , these mi - cropatterns do not allow cells to attach outside the defined areas on a coverslip . Given the small size of these areas ( 1 , 100 \u00b5m 2 ) , cells are laterally confined . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on slides with arrow - and H - shaped micropatterns ei - ther precoated with FN or not and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and p - Pax and imaged to measure RA coverage . In addition , to measure integrin \u03b2 1 activation , U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated similarly and stained for active integrin \u03b2 1 . Supporting our hypothesis , we could detect clear FCL and RAs in FN - coated micropatterns ( Fig . 9 , A and B ; and Fig . S5 K ) . On arrows , FCLs and RAs developed on the shaft of the pattern rather than the arched area . In the H - patterns , FCLs and RA developed all over the pattern . Cells on non - coated patterns made large FCLs and RAs often extending throughout the pat - tern ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Crucially , the RA coverage was not sig - nificantly different between coated or non - coated patterns ( Fig . 9 B ) . As expected , staining with active integrin \u03b2 1 ( 12G10 ) showed a clear difference in signal between FN - coated and non - coated patterns ( Fig . 9 C and Fig . S5 L ) . Importantly , further supporting a need for FB formation to inhibit FCLs and RAs , 12G10 signal was not organized as elongated , central FBs but rather confined at the cell periphery ( Fig . S5 K ) . Thus , the inhibitory role of FN on FCLs and RA formation occurs primarily via the activa - tion of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 on Tensin1 - positive fibrillar adhesions . The disassembly of FCLs and RAs is coupled to cell migration As physical restriction favored FCLs and RAs , we wondered if inducing migration will have the opposite effect . To test this hypothesis , we monitored FCLs and RAs in a classic wound healing assay . U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated dishes and allowed to grow to full confluency for 2 d . Cultures were then wounded and cells were allowed to migrate . At 0 min ( i . e . , just after wounding ) , FCLs and RAs were abundant and equally distributed at the edge and away from the wound ( Fig . 9 D ) . Within 80 min , the cells at the migration front had lost most of their FCLs and RAs , while cells further away from the edge maintained their FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 9 D ) . At 4 h , as the migratory front grew larger , the loss of FCL and RAs also extended away from the wound ( Fig . 9 D ) . In full accordance with the results we presented above , the disappearance of FCLs and RAs was preceded by the increase in FN secretion by the cells at the edge of the wound ( Fig . 9 , E and F ) . Together , these results place the resolution of FCLs and RAs as an intrinsic part of the cascade of events triggering cell migration ( Fig . 9 G ) . Discussion The extracellular environment is a key regulator of cellular physiology with integrins playing a key role translating the chemical composition of the extracellular milieu into intracel - lular signals . Among various mechanisms controlling integrin function , integrin trafficking via endocytosis and exocytosis plays a major role ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Thus far , the relationship between integrin - based matrix adhesions and en - docytosis has been considered primarily antagonistic , with en - docytosis playing a role in the disassembly of said adhesive structures ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we provide evidence , for the first time , of a constructive relationship between the endocytic machinery and cellular ad - hesions , where the CME machinery , in the form of FCLs , is key for the formation of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 RAs . Moreover , we show that RA formation is counteracted by the activation of a distinct in - tegrin heterodimer , \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 , in distinct adhesion structures , FBs , revealing an interesting mechanism of interadhesion crosstalk . Our results support the idea that FCLs and RAs are two sides of the same structure ( Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 at RAs in the formation of FCLs ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2022 ; Lock et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we show that this = 11 , 5 min = 11 , 10 min = 9 , 15 min = 8 , 20 min = 8 , 25 min = 6 , 30 min = 7 , 35 min = 6 . Videos were acquired from two independent experiments .

There - fore , we believe the previously suggested term clathrin con - taining adhesion complexes ( or CCAC for short ) is a more appropriate terminology to refer to these structures . The mechanism of RA formation by FCL and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 co - assembly We observed that RA formation events are rare , which led us to use non - physiological conditions \u2014 a Cilengitide washout experiment \u2014 to detect them . Therefore , the physiological trig - ger leading to the formation of FCLs and establishment of RAs remains to be understood . VTN , the ligand for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , could be considered a good candidate . However , as we show in Fig . 2 E and as reported by others ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 binds VTN equally on FAs and RAs . While it is clear that the presence of VTN is important as an extracellular tether for the formation of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 adhesions ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 , Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Lock et al . , 2018 ) , the switch between these adhesion types is likely an inside - out mechanism . We did not detect an increase in integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 RAs on VTN - coated dishes ( Fig . 1 B ) . This could seem counterintuitive , but VTN , which was initially called a \u201c serum spreading factor \u201d ( Hayman et al . , 1983 ) , is readily secreted by cells during attachment . Therefore , we advise caution when making conclusions based on the results of non - coated and VTN - coated dishes on the role of this ECM component on RA coverage . Further work is necessary to shed light on this issue . Recent evidence showed that EGFR activation led to the en - largement of FCLs in an integrin \u03b2 5 phosphorylation - dependent manner ( Alfonzo - M\u00b4endez et al . , 2022 ) , pointing to a possible mechanism for the initial coassembly of FCLs and RAs . This possibility is further reinforced by the fact that the relationship between growth factor receptors and integrins has been estab - lished in multiple contexts ( Ivaska and Heino , 2011 ) . Another key unknown aspect of RA formation by FCL and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 coassembly concerns how these structures can be molec - ularly differentiated from canonical endocytic events . The con - nection between integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 located in RAs and FCLs occurs primarily via the endocytic adaptors ARH and NUMB ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , these adaptors also participate in in - tegrin endocytosis ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , suggesting that other mechanisms may be required to define the identity of FCLs . Recently , a correlation was found between the presence of clathrin plaques and an alternatively spliced isoform of clathrin containing exon 31 in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We did not detect any changes in clathrin splicing in our experimental system , which was not surprising given the effects we see are contact - dependent and could not be explained by transcriptional changes . In addition , we cannot ensure that the clathrin plaques detected in myotubes are equivalent to the FCLs we observe here . Nonetheless , it is possible that the abundance of the exon 31 - positive clathrin isoform works as a dial that changes the probability , speed , or efficiency by which cells form FCLs . Another unusual function of the clathrin machinery In addition to its endocytic function , the clathrin machinery has been shown to participate in other processes . For example , clathrin helps to stabilize the mitotic spindle by binding to mi - crotubules ( Royle , 2012 ) and , during E . coli infection , the CME machinery is co - opted to form a clathrin - based actin - rich ad - hesive structure for the bacteria called pedestal ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a clathrin / AP2 tubular lattice was re - cently described to envelop collagen fibers during cell migration ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . The results we present here add to this list of non - endocytic functions of CME components with an im - portant twist . FCLs can also be disassembled into individual endocytic events ( Lampe et al . , 2016 ; Tagiltsev et al . , 2021 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ) , providing an elegant and efficient mechanism for cells to switch the same machinery from an adhesion assembly to an adhesion disassembly function . Inhibition of CCAC and its relationship to cell migration In addition to defining FCLs as key factors in the establishment of CCACs , our work has also revealed many interesting aspects of the inhibition and disassembly of these structures . We show that activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 by FN and the capacity of this integrin heterodimer to form FBs are both essential for the in - hibition and disassembly of CCAC . In a classical wound healing assay , we observed that as cells start to migrate they secrete FN , leading to the disappearance of CCACs . However , using laterally confined cells that cannot form FBs , we observed that the mere presence of FN is not enough to inhibit CCACs . A recent study showed that high levels of activated myosin light chain ( p - MLC ) correlated with integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localizing to FAs over RAs ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) . Moreover , overexpression of a consti - tutively active RhoA mutant in a cell line with low p - MLC levels promoted integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localization to FAs ( Zuidema et al . 2022 ) . Interestingly , expression of the very same RhoA mutant leads to increased FN secretion ( Danen et al . , 2002 ) . As Integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 - mediated FN fibrillogenesis is required for optimal acti - vation of the RhoA - MLC pathway , which in turn increases actin stress fiber - based migration along FBs ( Gagn\u00b4e et al . , 2020 ; Huveneers et al . , 2008 ; Danen et al . , 2002 ) , these findings per - fectly complement our data . Together , these results suggest that the disappearance of CCACs requires FN activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 followed by the activation of actin contractility during the cell migration process .

Similarly , whether the disas - sembly of CCACs occurs actively or is a mere consequence of a non - permissive environment for the de novo formation of new adhesions is still unknown . Given the fact that RAs are long - lasting cellular adhesion structures , it is tempting to hypothesize that these structures act as a \u201c parking brake \u201d for a cell . As the cell is triggered to migrate , this brake needs to be released for efficient cell movement . This process would be analogous to the loss of cell \u2013 cell contacts , which happens during epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( Kalluri and Weinberg , 2009 ) , but instead of happening between cells , it would happen between the cell and the ECM . Therefore , we propose that disassembly of RAs is an intrinsic process during cell migration . We showed that FN regulates CCAC assembly in all the cell lines we tested . However , how these in vitro findings will op - erate in vivo is still unknown . Even though the ECM composi - tion in tissues is complex , the FN effect on CCAC formation is local and strictly contact dependent , which opens the possibility that , in vivo , tissues may use focal changes in ECM composition to control these structures .

Corresponding sec - ondary antibodies raised against rabbit or mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch . Coating of imaging dishes To compare the effects of major ECM proteins on AP2 lifetimes , the glass coverslip areas ( 14 mm diameter ) of imaging dishes ( Mattek ) were precoated with 10 or 20 \u00b5g / ml ( 300 \u03bc l in PBS ) of the following ECM proteins : recombinant human FN ( 341631 ; Merck ) , recombinant human VTN ( 140 - 09 ; PeproTech ) , Col IV ( Santa cruz , se - 29010 ) , Col I ( C3867 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and LN111 ( # LN111 ; Biolamina ) .

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent with an additional acidic phenol ( pH 5 . 4 ) ex - traction step to remove genomic DNA contamination . cDNA synthesis from 1 \u00b5g total RNA was carried out using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Scien - tific ) and oligo dT12 \u2013 18 ( Life Technologies ) . No enzyme re - actions were included to confirm that no genomic DNA was present . PCR was performed using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Scientific ) with no other variations from Moulay et al . ( 2020 ) . Primers used were F 9 TGC CCTATTTCATCCAGGTCA and R 9 ATGGGTTGTGTCTCTGTAGC . Gel images were acquired using a GelDoc XL ( Bio Rad ) . Western blots U2Os were silenced for respective proteins , as mentioned above , and lysed into 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 , and 1 % NP - 40 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) .

Each video rep - resents endocytic events from two to three cells ( total field of view ) . Acute manipulation of integrin activity Integrin \u03b2 1 blocking Acute modulation of ligand binding activity for integrin \u03b2 1 was achieved using the function - blocking antibody mab13 ( 0 . 3 \u00b5g / ml ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on FN , as explained above , and 16 \u2013 20 h later subjected to live TIRF imaging . 0 - min sample has no mab13 added to control baseline FCL proportions . Im - mediately after mab13 addition , 5 - min time lapses were con - tinuously collected until 35 min ; control videos ( time point 0 ) had no mab13 added . Integrin \u03b2 5 blocking To acutely induce the inhibition of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , we used the small molecular inhibitor Cilengitide ( HY - 16141 ; MedChem Ex - press , 10 \u00b5M ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated imag - ing dishes were treated with Cilengitide for 15 or 45 min , fixed , stained , and imaged with the ONI Nanoimager microscope at TIRF angle and analyzed for the resulting reduction of RA coverage . Cilengitide washout U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes and 1 d later confluent monolayers were treated with 1 \u00b5M Cilengitide for 15 \u2013 25 min , during which most FCLs and RAs were dissociated from the cell membrane . Samples were then washed twice and immediately subjected to live TIRF imaging to detect the de novo formation of FCLs and RAs . 1 - h time - lapses were acquired with the ONI Nanoimager micro - scope at TIRF angle , at 30 s intervals , with an exposure time of 100 ms for AP2 and 300 ms for integrin \u03b2 5 . Immunofluorescence experiments Immunofluorescent staining and imaging For immunofluorescence experiments , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde \u2013 PBS for 15 min in a + 37\u00b0C incubator , washed with PBS , and blocked with 1 % BSA - PBS . Primary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA \u2013 PBS were incubated for 1 h , samples were washed with PBS , and secondary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA \u2013 PBS were let to bind for 30 min . Samples were imaged with the ONI Nanoimager microscope using a TIRF angle and expo - sure times of 500 or 1 , 000 ms . Manipulation of CME machinery to study RA formation Clathrin assembly at the cell membrane was reduced by si - lencing two subdomains of AP2 or by overexpressing AP180 ct , which acts as a dominant negative for AP2 . U2Os AP2 - GFP cells silenced for AP2A1 shRNA # 1 and # 2 or AP2S1 shRNA # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , and control shRNA , and plated on non - coated imaging dishes were fixed and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax . Alternatively , AP180 ct was overexpressed in U2Os AP2 - GFP cells , and cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes , fixed the next day , and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and p - Pax . RA for - mation ( integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 adhesions without FA marker ) and FAs ( integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 colocalizing with FA marker ) were imaged using TIRF microscopy . Manipulation of integrin activity and availability We performed time - series experiments to block integrin \u03b2 1 ac - tive conformation with the mab13 antibody or to inhibit integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 with Cilengitide . Experiments utilizing mab13 were per - formed with U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN - coated dishes to disfavor the preformation of FCLs and RAs . Mab13 ( 0 . 3 \u00b5g / ml ) was added to replicate samples and fixed 15 , 30 , or 45 min later . Similarly , U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes to favor the preformation of FCLs and RAs were treated with Cil - engitide . Samples were stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Cilengitide washout Cilengitide washout experiments were developed to study acute reappearance of FCLs and RAs in cell cultures . Cells were treated for 15 \u2013 25 min with 1 \u00b5M Cilengitide ( or DMSO as control ) and washed two times . Unwashed controls were collected . Washed samples were let to recover for indicated time points , fixed , stained for p - Pax , subjected to TIRF imaging , and analyzed for the reappearance of FCLs and RAs ( RA coverage ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin \u03b2 1 , integrin \u03b2 5 , integrin \u03b1 5 , or Tensin1 and controls were plated either on FN - coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB1 shRNAs , ITGA5 shRNAs , or TNS1 shRNAs ) or on non - coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB5 shRNAs ) and fixed the next day , 16 \u2013 20 h later . Samples were stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Micropatterning U2Os - AP2 - GFP or U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were seeded onto micropatterned glass coverslips ( CYTOO ) ei - ther precoated with FN 10 \u00b5g / ml or left uncoated . Excess amount ( 60 , 000 ) of cells were plated and monitored for attachment to the patterns . The cells plated on FN had at - tached in 1 h and the cells plated on non - coated micro - patterns had attached in 4 h . After attachment , excess cells were carefully rinsed and the samples were fixed 16 \u2013 20 h later , stained , and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with TIRF microscopy . Wound healing stimulated migration U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated confluent onto non - coated imaging dishes for 2 d . Fully confluent monolayers were wounded with a micropipette tip , washed twice with fresh complete medium , and let to migrate . 0 - min samples were col - lected directly after wounding . After fixing , samples were stained and subjected to TIRF imaging .

For all experiments , \u201c n \u201d refers to a movie , which contained two to four cells . To determine the proportion of FCLs , we used the output from u - track to count the number of pits ( events lasting longer than 20 s and shorter than 120 s ) and the number of FCLs ( events lasting longer than 120 s , as described in Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) in all frames . We took a conservative approach to identify bona fide CME events ( i . e . clathrin coated pits \u2014 CCPs ) , where events that were present at the start or lasted beyond the end of the movies were not counted as CCPs . This approach artificially led to higher FCL proportions in the first and final 120 movie frames . Therefore , FCL proportions are presented as the average FCL proportion from frames 120 \u2013 175 for each movie . Other analyses With the exception of FCL proportions , all image analyses were performed using ImageJ . Simple fluorescence measurements were done manually . Others were performed using custom scripts as shown below . RA ( and FA ) coverage Individual cells were marked , and ITGB5 ( or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) and p - Pax channels were transformed into binary masks using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . The Robust Automatic Threshold Selection parameters used for segmentation ( \u201c noise , \u201d \u201c lambda , \u201d and \u201c min \u201d ) were defined by visual inspection for each experiment . The mask of the p - Pax channel was then subtracted from the mask of the ITGB5 ( or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) channel using the \u201c image calculation \u201d function . This calculation results in a mask con - taining only the RAs ( i . e . , ITGB5 [ or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ] signals not colocal - izing with p - Pax ) . RA coverage was then calculated by dividing the area covered by RAs in the RA mask ( integrated density / 255 ) by the area of each marked cell ( or cells ) in the image . An il - lustration of this method is shown in Fig . S6 . Data is presented as a percentage of the cell area covering RAs . Focal adhesion coverage ( Fig . S2 A ) was calculated by divid - ing the area of the p - Pax mask by the area of each marked cell ( or cells ) in the image . For the wound healing experiment , a line on the migration front of each image was manually drawn . This line was then used as a reference to automatically draw a box 100 pixels in width ( 11 . 7 \u00b5m ) . RA coverage ( as above ) was calculated for this box , which was then moved inward in the culture in 50 - pixel steps , where the RA coverage analysis was repeated . Values are normalized to the average RA coverage on the three innermost areas in the culture . AP2 - ITGB5 dynamics Events showing the appearance of both AP2 and ITGB5 were identified by visual inspection of videos . For the generation of graphs , we selected only events where we could unambiguously ensure that significant FCLs and ITGB5 signals were not present in the region for at least 3 min . For the events where an RA was established ( Fig . 5 B , left ) , time zero was defined as the frame where AP2 signal appeared , and fluorescence intensity from a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m region around each event was measured for 3 min before ( six frames ) and 5 min after ( 10 frames ) . For the events where ITGB5 clusters did not result in established RAs ( Fig . 5 B , right ) , time zero was defined as the frame where the ITGB5 signal disappeared . Fluorescence was normalized to the highest value in these frames . AP2 intensity per colocalization status AP2 , ITGB5 , and p - Pax channels were segmented using the Ro - bust Automatic Threshold Selection function ( similarly to what was done in the RA coverage experiments ) . Individual AP2 spots were identified as regions of interest ( ROIs ) using the \u201c analyze particles \u201d function . The fluorescence intensity for each AP2 spot ( i . e . , ROI ) was then measured from the original image . Using the same AP2 ROIs in the ITGB5 and p - Pax binary masks , we then classified each AP2 spot for their colocalization with either marker . In this case , an AP2 ROI with a non - zero signal in either mask was considered colocalizing . We used full images for these analyses . RAs colocalizing to AP2 Individual cells were marked and AP2 , ITGB5 , and p - Pax chan - nels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were defined as ITGB5 signals not co - localizing with p - Pax . In the conditions used for these experi - ments ( FN + mab13 ) , RAs were primarily individual spots . The colocalization of RAs to AP2 was classified by measuring the intensity of each RA region at the segmented AP2 channel . FN intensity vs . AP2 intensity AP2 , ITGB5 , and P - Pax channels were segmented using the Ro - bust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the fluorescence intensity measured from the original image . A 3 \u00b5m \u00d7 3 \u00b5m region was drawn around each AP2 spot and used to measure the intensity of FN from the original image . Data are presented as the fluorescence for each AP2 spot . Statistics Figure legends state the exact n - values and individual repeats used in analyses . For multiple comparisons , one - way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey \u2019 s multiple comparison . Pair - wise comparisons were performed using two - tailed Student \u2019 s t test with two - tailed distributions . Data distributions were as - sumed to be normal , but this was not formally tested . All graphs and statistical calculations were performed with GraphPad Prism 9 . Online supplemental material Fig .

To calculate RA coverage , images of the integrin ( \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) and paxillin ( p - Pax ) channels are segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection method in ImageJ . This method generates binary masks for each channel . The paxillin channel is then subtracted from the integrin channel and results in a mask containing only the RAs . RA coverage is calculated by dividing the area covered by RAs in pixels ( integrated density / 255 ) by the area covered by the cell ( or cells ) in an image . Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

Why FCLs and RAs colocalize is not known . Here , we show that RAs are assembled at FCLs in a process controlled by fibronectin ( FN ) and its receptor , integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 . We observed that cells on FN - rich matrices displayed fewer FCLs and RAs . CME machinery inhibition abolished RAs and live - cell imaging showed that RA establishment requires FCL coassembly . The inhibitory activity of FN was mediated by the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 at Tensin1 - positive fibrillar adhesions . Conventionally , endocytosis disassembles cellular adhesions by internalizing their components . Our results present a novel paradigm in the relationship between these two processes by showing that endocytic proteins can actively function in the assembly of cell adhesions . Furthermore , we show this novel adhesion assembly mechanism is coupled to cell migration via unique crosstalk between cell - matrix adhesions . Introduction Integrins are nonenzymatic dimeric transmembrane receptors that recognize ECM components . These mechanosensory pro - teins govern cell adhesion to the ECM maintaining correct tissue development and function , with elaborate connections to cel - lular homeostasis and disease ( Kanchanawong and Calderwood , 2023 ) . Ligand availability and biochemical and physical prop - erties of the ECM determine integrin activation status , integrin clustering , and , ultimately , the formation of cellular adhesion structures ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Cells can form a variety of integrin - based adhesions . Small integrin clusters engaged to the ECM , called nascent adhesions , form on the cell periphery and establish their connection to the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins such as Talin . A bal - ancing act of traction forces and signaling molecules determines whether nascent adhesions mature into larger and molecularly more complex focal adhesions ( FAs ; Wehrle - Haller , 2012 ) . In migrating cells and in the presence of the ECM component fi - bronectin ( FN ) , FAs can serve as platforms for the formation of fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) , where FN - bound \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 integrins are formed along actin cables as they extend FN fibrils ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ) . Common to all these types of cell adhesions , their disassembly is mediated by the removal of integrin mole - cules from adhesion sites via endocytosis ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Recently , a novel type of integrin - based cell adhesion was discovered ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) . Called reticular adhesions ( RAs ) , these structures contain integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , lack the typical markers for the other adhesion types , such as Talin1 or Paxillin , and are not connected to actin stress fibers . RAs can occupy a significant portion of the substrate - facing surface of cells in culture and can significantly outlast FAs . Their physiological function is , how - ever , not clear . Intriguingly , RAs colocalize with large , persistent forms of clathrin structures at the cell membrane called flat clathrin lattices ( FCLs ; also referred to as clathrin plaques ; Grove et al . , 2014 ) . The structure containing FCLs and RAs is called clathrin - containing adhesion complexes ( CCAC ; Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . FCLs were previously considered stalled endocytic events of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) pathway . However , recent studies have changed this view and support the idea that FCLs are signaling platforms ( Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ; Grove et al . , 2014 ; Alfonzo - M\u00b4endez et al . , 2022 ) . In vivo , FCLs localize to adhesive structures between bone and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Helsinki Institute of Life Science , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland ; 2 Institute of Biotechnology , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland ; 3 Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland ; 4 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden ; 5 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , UK .

The functional relationship between FCLs and RAs is not clear . A confounding factor in this relationship lies in the fact that although FCLs always localize to RAs , the opposite is not true . RAs can occur as large structures with FCLs covering only a fraction of their area . Moreover , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 can localize to both RAs and FAs . Although details on the factors mediating integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localization to FCLs are becoming clearer ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) , why these struc - tures co - exist , what their function is , and how cells control their formation remain a mystery . In this study , we show that FCLs are required for the estab - lishment of RAs . Moreover , we found that an FN - rich ECM acts as an inhibitor of RA formation . This inhibitory role of FN is mediated by the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 localized at fibrillar adhesions . Furthermore , we show that the transition from a static to a migratory state is mirrored by the disappearance of FCLs and RAs . Results FN inhibits the formation of FCLs While studying CME dynamics , we serendipitously observed that cells on FN appear to display fewer FCLs when compared with cells plated on non - coated glass dishes . To confirm if ECM proteins in general can influence CME , we assessed the effect of several major ECM components as well as non - ECM coatings and non - coated surfaces on the amount of FCLs . For that , dishes were coated for 16 \u2013 24 h , after which cells were let to attach for 16 \u2013 20 h in serum - containing medium before imaging . For quantifications , we established the metric FCL proportion , which defines the average fraction of FCLs per frame among all clathrin - coated structures detected in a 5 - min movie ( see Ma - terials and methods for details ) . These experiments were per - formed using U2Os cells with an endogenously GFP - tagged \u03b1 adaptin 2 Sigma - Aldrich subunit ( AP2S1 , hereafter referred to simply as AP2 ) . AP2 is a widely used CME marker that faithfully mirrors clathrin dynamics ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2008 ) . We used endoge - nously tagged cell lines throughout this study as the expression level of the AP2 complex was shown to modulate the amount of FCLs ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . U2Os cells on non - coated dishes presented typical and abundant FCLs ( i . e . , bright , long - lived AP2 - GFP marked struc - tures ; Fig . 1 , A and B ; Fig . S1 A ; and Video 1 ) , similar to what has been found in many cell lines ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ; Moulay et al . , 2020 ; Sochacki et al . , 2021 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Simi - larly , U2Os cells plated on dishes coated with the non - ECM proteins BSA and poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) also presented high FCL proportions ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S1 A ; and Video 1 ) . Out of the major ECM proteins tested , FN , collagen IV ( Col IV ) , and laminin - 111 ( LN111 ) reduced FCL proportion significantly . The integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ligand vitronectin ( VTN ) did not increase or decrease the FCL proportion when compared to non - coated dishes ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S1 A ; see Discussion ) . Similarly , and in line with a recent study ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) , collagen I ( Col I ) did not reduce FCLs ( Fig . 1 B , Fig . S1 A , and Video 1 ) . Different concentrations of FN used for coating ( 10 or 20 \u00b5g / ml ) did not show significant differences ( Fig . 1 B ) . Recently , it was described that SCC - 9 cells produce more FN when plated on Col IV or LN111 ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . To probe if this is also the case for our cells , we stained FN from U2Os cells plated directly onto non - coated dishes or plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I , or LN111 . While U2Os cells produce little FN overnight , cells plated on Col IV produced a striking amount of FN , which assembled into elongated fibrils ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . LN111 coating also induced FN production , but less strikingly than Col IV . Col I and VTN coating were unable to stimulate FN production ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . These results suggest that FN is the main ECM com - ponent inhibiting FCL formation . For many cell lines , it is common to find considerable vari - ability in the amount of FCLs in culture . We thus decided to test if this variability is due to differential FN production within the culture . Confirming this hypothesis ( and bearing in mind that U2Os secrete FN modestly ; see below ) , we found that cells plated on non - coated dishes displaying fewer FCLs were predomi - nantly lying on top of an FN - rich region of the culture ( Fig . S1 B ) . Next , we asked if the reduction in FCL proportions observed in FN - coated samples is a cell - wide effect or specific to cellular regions in direct contact with the extracellular substrate . For that , we used patterned dishes containing FN - coated regions interspersed with uncoated regions , where single U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells could adhere simultaneously to both an FN - and a non - coated region . In line with a contact - dependent effect , low FCL proportions were observed in cellular regions in contact with FN whereas FCL proportion was high in cellular regions contacting non - coated surfaces ( Fig . 1 , E \u2013 G , and Video 2 ) . The abundance of an alternative splice variant of the clathrin heavy chain containing exon 31 was recently shown to increase the frequency of clathrin plaques in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We thus tested if the effects we observe are also due to changes in clathrin splicing but found no differences when comparing cells plated on non - coated or FN - coated dishes ( Fig . S1 C ) . Thus , these results show that FN is a potent inhibitor of FCLs . Moreover , FN inhibits FCLs in a contact - dependent man - ner locally within a single cell ( Fig . 1 H ) . FN inhibits the formation of RAs in a similar manner as FCLs As discussed in the introduction , FCLs localize to RAs . To check how ECM composition affects these structures , U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I , or LN111 and stained with the RA component integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and \u2014 to be able to distinguish integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 on RAs or FAs \u2014 were also stained with an FA marker ( p - Pax Y118 ; phosphorylated paxillin ) . Cells plated overnight without coating formed abundant RAs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . On FN - coated dishes , big RAs were largely absent but small \u201c dot - like \u201d nascent RAs were present in a few cells . Similarly , on Col IV and LN111 coatings ( which stimulated FN production ; Fig . 1 C ) , cells formed significantly fewer RAs than on non - coated dishes ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Coating with VTN , the ligand for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 present at RAs and FAs alike ( Fig . S1 C ; Lock et al . , 2018 ) , did not result in more RAs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Dif - ferent coatings also changed the total amount of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

S1 D ) . However , they did not follow a clear relationship with the amount of RAs . To quantify differences in RA amounts in cells , we developed a metric called RA coverage , which measures the fraction of the area of the cell covered by integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 signal ( excluding FAs ) . RA coverage serves as a good metric to distinguish between large and nascent RAs and , crucially , it shows a clear correspondence between RA content and both FCL proportion and FN abundance in the ECM ( see Fig . 1 , B \u2013 D , and Fig . 2 B ) . Next , we used our substrate patterning strategy to check if the local FN effects on FCLs were also similar for RAs . Strikingly , cells plated on patterned FN revealed that RAs , akin to FCLs , were completely inhibited on cellular regions in contact with FN . Cellular regions in contact with non - coated surfaces displayed many FCLs colocalizing with RAs while regions in contact with FN presented no RAs or FCLs ( Fig . 2 C ) . Interest - ingly , in these patterned substrates , most of the integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 signal segregated to non - coated regions forming typical RAs ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . This contrasts with cells plated in fully coated dishes ( Fig . 2 A ) , where integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 can be seen in both RAs and FAs . Hence , the inhibitory effects of FN on FCLs affect RAs in a similar manner ( Fig . 2 E ) . The effect of FN on FCLs and RAs is clear in various cell lines Next , we checked if the effects we see in U2Os cells are also true for other cell lines . To avoid problems of overexpression , we endogenously tagged AP2 with either Halo tag or GFP in various human cell lines : HeLa ( epithelial , cervical carcinoma ) , MCF7 Figure 2 .

These cell lines presented a large variation in the amount of FCLs and the morphology of RAs . Importantly , these cells could be divided into two groups in terms of endogenous FN secretion , and this division clearly correlated with the amount of FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . U2Os , HeLa , and MCF7 composed the group of low - FN - secretion cells . U2Os form large RAs on non - coated dishes , whereas HeLa formed multiple dot - like nascent RAs ( which colocalized with FCLs ) , with bigger RAs found more seldom ( Fig . 3 A ) . MCF7 cells formed many FCLs and large RAs covering almost the entire cell area ( Fig . 3 A ) . None of the high FN - secreting cell lines ( HDF , Caco2 , and hMEC ) formed large RAs ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . In these high FN - producing cells , small FCL / RA dots were often found in areas with less deposited FN ( Fig . 3 A ) . We next evaluated the response of these cell lines to FN precoating . In low - FN - producing cell lines ( U2Os , HeLa , and MCF7 ) , RA coverage dropped significantly ( Fig . 3 , C \u2013 E ) . Among the high - FN - production cell lines , only Caco2 reduced its RA coverage on FN - coated dishes ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . As expected , HDF and hMEC , which had low RA coverage without coating , did not show a significant response to FN coating ( Fig . 3 , C \u2013 E ) . To evaluate if changes in the amount of RAs are reflected in the amount of FAs , we measure FA coverage ( i . e . , the cellular area covered by FAs ) from U2Os , Hela , and MCF7 . We did not observe any clear difference in the coverage of FAs for these three cell lines plated on uncoated or FN - coated dishes ( Fig . S2 A ) . These results suggest that the dynamics of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 in FAs and RAs are controlled independently . For all experiments so far , we used media supplemented with serum , which is known to contain ECM components , including FN . Given that our cells are left to attach overnight in this media , it would be reasonable to expect that the FN present in serum would coat the dishes and completely mask our results . To test why this does not seem to happen ( Fig . 1 C and Fig . 3 A ) , we compared the amount of FN deposited on the glass surface in different conditions : dishes were coated for 24 h with 10 , 5 , and 1 \u00b5g / ml of FN ( diluted in PBS ) , 100 % FBS , media with 10 % FBS , and PBS as a control . After coating , U2Os cells were plated and left to attach for 16 h before being fixed and stained for FN . Surprisingly , our results revealed that very little FN was de - posited on glass in dishes \u201c coated \u201d with full media or pure FBS ( Fig . S1 , F and G ) . These results are in line with similar ex - periments performed 30 years ago ( Steele et al . , 1992 ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon occurs due to the high concentrations of BSA in serum ( 40 mg / ml ) , which rapidly saturates the surface of culture dishes , thereby acting as a blocking agent for the binding of serum FN . Taken together , the presence of FN controls the formation of RAs and FCLs in a very similar manner and in different cell lines ( Fig . 3 F ) , suggesting a common and general mechanism for the establishment of these structures . The CME machinery is essential for RA formation Next , we set out to dissect the relationship between the for - mation of FCLs and RAs . It has been shown that integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 is required for the establishment of FCLs ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . We confirmed this observation by si - lencing integrin \u03b2 5 from U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes and , indeed , they displayed a significantly lower FCL proportion compared with control cells ( Fig . S2 , B and C ) . Further , while integrin \u03b2 5 - silenced cells were unable to form RAs , they did form FAs ( Fig . S2 , D and E ) . The requirement of integrin \u03b2 5 for FCL formation was further confirmed using Cilengitide , the inhibitor for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ( Desgrosellier and Cheresh , 2010 ) , as the treatment led to a rapid disassembly of FCLs and RAs ( Fig . S2 , F and G ) . While all FCLs colocalize to RAs , FCL - free areas of larger RAs are rather common ( e . g . , Fig . 2 A ; Fig . 3 , A \u2013 C ; and Fig . S2 D ) , which may give the impression that FCLs are formed on pre - existing RAs . Nevertheless , the fact that both structures are inhibited independently by FN suggests a deeper relationship and led us to ask if RAs can exist without the CME machinery . To answer this question , we quantified the RA coverage in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex subunits \u03b1 1 ( AP2A1 ) or Sigma - Aldrich 1 ( AP2S1 ) in cells plated on non - coated dishes , a condition where we observe large RAs . Consistent with an important role played by the CME machinery in RA formation , AP2A1 - or AP2S1 - silenced cells ( easily recog - nizable as cells with little to no AP2 - GFP signal ) did not display RAs . Instead , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localized to FAs ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . To confirm these results , we expressed the AP180 C - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ) , which acts as a strong dominant negative of CME ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . AP180ct - positive U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes displayed low AP2 signal at the membrane and , akin to AP2 - silenced cells , RAs were largely absent with integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localized to FAs , whereas AP180ct - negative cells displayed typical FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Thus , the CME machinery is required for the formation of RAs ( Fig . 4 E ) . Next , we set out to visualize the dynamics of AP2 during RA formation . For that , we generated a double U2Os knock - in cell line AP2 - GFP and integrin \u03b2 5 ( ITGB5 ) - mScarlet . RAs are re - markably stable structures ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) and their de novo formation is rare , making it rather difficult to capture such events . To minimize this challenge , we optimized the conditions for Cilengitide treatment to disassemble RAs followed by a washout , when RAs could start reforming ( Fig . S3 , A and B ) . Using these washout conditions , we were able to capture events showing that the formation and growth of ITGB5 - positive structures are accompanied by the formation of FCLs ( Fig . 5 A ; Fig . S3 , C and D ; and Videos 3 and 4 ) . Also , in events where we could not clearly detect the extension of a mature RA ( reminiscent of the dot - like structures we see in many cells ) , we noticed that the establish - ment of an FCL was typically accompanied by an increase in ITGB5 fluorescence ( Fig . 5 B ; Fig . S3 , C and D ; and Video 3 ) . Importantly , ITGB5 - positive structures , which did not colocalize with an FCL , rapidly disappeared . In many cases , this disappearance was pre - ceded by bona fide CME events ( short lived AP2 - GFP signals ) , likely representing CME - mediated ITGB5 - cluster disassembly ( Fig . 5 B and Fig . S3 D ) . Taken together , our results show that the relationship be - tween FCLs and RAs is beyond a simple colocalization . In fact , Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

S2 ) . The inhibitory effect of FN on FCL and RA formation is mediated by integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 To understand the mechanism controlling the coassembly of FCLs and RAs , we turned our attention back to FN . While in - tegrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 binds to VTN at FAs and RAs , the major FN receptor is integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . First , we acutely interfered with integrin \u03b2 1 binding to FN using the function - blocking antibody mab13 . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells seeded on FN - coated dishes were treated with mab13 and monitored for the acute formation of FCLs and RAs . Over the time course of 45 min , mab13 induced the relocalization of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 from FAs to small , newly formed RAs ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Further sup - porting the role of FCLs in RA assembly , these newly formed RAs completely colocalized with FCLs ( bright AP2 signals ; Fig . 6 , A \u2013 C ) . A similar experiment followed by live - cell imaging con - firmed these results and showed a gradual increase in FCL proportions after mab13 treatment ( Fig . 6 D ) . Mab13 treatment had no effect on existing FCLs and RAs formed on non - coated dishes ( data not shown ) . In line with these results , integrin \u03b2 1 silencing in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN resulted in a high FCL proportion and large , prominent RAs ( Fig . 7 , A \u2013 D , and Fig . S4 , A \u2013 C ) . Despite the striking increase of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 on the bottom surface of si - lenced cells , this increase was not reflected in expression levels , indicating that the stimulation of RA formation leads to a change in the trafficking of this integrin dimer ( Fig . S4 C ) . A significant increase in RAs was also seen in cells silenced for integrin \u03b1 5 , the \u03b1 subunit which pairs with integrin \u03b2 1 for FN binding ( Fig . 7 , C \u2013 E , and Fig . S4 , D and E ) . Taken together , these results show that the inhibitory activity of FN on RAs and FCLs occurs via the activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 ( Fig . 7 F ) . Activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 at FBs controls RA and FCL formation When bound to FN , integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 translocates centripetally from FAs to form elongated structures called FBs along actin stress fibers . This movement generates long FN fibrils in a process called FN fibrillogenesis and is mediated by the cytoskeleton scaffolding protein Tensin1 ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ) . To determine Figure 5 .

The staining revealed that in the FN - coated dishes , active integrin \u03b2 1 was colocalizing with FBs ( Tensin1 ; Fig . 8 A ) . As expected , active integrin \u03b2 1 and Tensin1 - positive adhesions were largely absent in non - coated dishes ( Fig . 8 A ) . Next , to determine which active integrin \u03b2 1 pool is more important for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we silenced FAs and FB components on U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells and plated them on FN . In accordance with the higher accumulation of active in - tegrin \u03b2 1 in FBs , silencing of Tensin1 led to a marked increase of RAs and FCLs accompanied by a reduction in the presence of active integrin \u03b2 1 on the membrane ( evidence by 12G10 antibody staining ; Fig . 8 , B and C ; and Fig . S5 , A \u2013 C ) . Silencing of the FA component Talin - 1 also led to increased RAs and FCLs and a reduction of active integrin \u03b2 1 on the membrane ( Fig . S5 , D \u2013 F ) . Given the strong phenotype on Tensin1 knockdown , this result was expected as FAs are precursors of FBs . FB formation indicates activated and migratory cell pheno - types . Indeed , active sliding of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 and Tensin1 bound to FN along central actin stress fibers increases traction forces ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ; Pankov et al . , 2000 ) and is re - quired in cell migration during development and cancer me - tastasis ( Efthymiou et al . , 2020 ; Schwarzbauer and DeSimone , 2011 ) . If the extension of active integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 into FBs is indeed required for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we hypothe - sized that physical confinement of cells \u2014 which inhibits cell migration \u2014 would also inhibit the sliding of FB from FAs . In turn , the absence of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 in FBs would favor FCLs and RAs , even if cells were plated on an FN - rich matrix . To test this possibility , we turned to single - cell micropatterns . In contrast to the patterned coatings we used in Figs . 1 and 2 , these mi - cropatterns do not allow cells to attach outside the defined areas on a coverslip . Given the small size of these areas ( 1 , 100 \u00b5m 2 ) , cells are laterally confined . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on slides with arrow - and H - shaped micropatterns ei - ther precoated with FN or not and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and p - Pax and imaged to measure RA coverage . In addition , to measure integrin \u03b2 1 activation , U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated similarly and stained for active integrin \u03b2 1 . Supporting our hypothesis , we could detect clear FCL and RAs in FN - coated micropatterns ( Fig . 9 , A and B ; and Fig . S5 K ) . On arrows , FCLs and RAs developed on the shaft of the pattern rather than the arched area . In the H - patterns , FCLs and RA developed all over the pattern . Cells on non - coated patterns made large FCLs and RAs often extending throughout the pat - tern ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Crucially , the RA coverage was not sig - nificantly different between coated or non - coated patterns ( Fig . 9 B ) . As expected , staining with active integrin \u03b2 1 ( 12G10 ) showed a clear difference in signal between FN - coated and non - coated patterns ( Fig . 9 C and Fig . S5 L ) . Importantly , further supporting a need for FB formation to inhibit FCLs and RAs , 12G10 signal was not organized as elongated , central FBs but rather confined at the cell periphery ( Fig . S5 K ) . Thus , the inhibitory role of FN on FCLs and RA formation occurs primarily via the activa - tion of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 on Tensin1 - positive fibrillar adhesions . The disassembly of FCLs and RAs is coupled to cell migration As physical restriction favored FCLs and RAs , we wondered if inducing migration will have the opposite effect . To test this hypothesis , we monitored FCLs and RAs in a classic wound healing assay . U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated dishes and allowed to grow to full confluency for 2 d . Cultures were then wounded and cells were allowed to migrate . At 0 min ( i . e . , just after wounding ) , FCLs and RAs were abundant and equally distributed at the edge and away from the wound ( Fig . 9 D ) . Within 80 min , the cells at the migration front had lost most of their FCLs and RAs , while cells further away from the edge maintained their FCLs and RAs ( Fig . 9 D ) . At 4 h , as the migratory front grew larger , the loss of FCL and RAs also extended away from the wound ( Fig . 9 D ) . In full accordance with the results we presented above , the disappearance of FCLs and RAs was preceded by the increase in FN secretion by the cells at the edge of the wound ( Fig . 9 , E and F ) . Together , these results place the resolution of FCLs and RAs as an intrinsic part of the cascade of events triggering cell migration ( Fig . 9 G ) . Discussion The extracellular environment is a key regulator of cellular physiology with integrins playing a key role translating the chemical composition of the extracellular milieu into intracel - lular signals . Among various mechanisms controlling integrin function , integrin trafficking via endocytosis and exocytosis plays a major role ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Thus far , the relationship between integrin - based matrix adhesions and en - docytosis has been considered primarily antagonistic , with en - docytosis playing a role in the disassembly of said adhesive structures ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we provide evidence , for the first time , of a constructive relationship between the endocytic machinery and cellular ad - hesions , where the CME machinery , in the form of FCLs , is key for the formation of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 RAs . Moreover , we show that RA formation is counteracted by the activation of a distinct in - tegrin heterodimer , \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 , in distinct adhesion structures , FBs , revealing an interesting mechanism of interadhesion crosstalk . Our results support the idea that FCLs and RAs are two sides of the same structure ( Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 at RAs in the formation of FCLs ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2022 ; Lock et al . , 2019 ) .

There - fore , we believe the previously suggested term clathrin con - taining adhesion complexes ( or CCAC for short ) is a more appropriate terminology to refer to these structures . The mechanism of RA formation by FCL and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 co - assembly We observed that RA formation events are rare , which led us to use non - physiological conditions \u2014 a Cilengitide washout experiment \u2014 to detect them . Therefore , the physiological trig - ger leading to the formation of FCLs and establishment of RAs remains to be understood . VTN , the ligand for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , could be considered a good candidate . However , as we show in Fig . 2 E and as reported by others ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) , integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 binds VTN equally on FAs and RAs . While it is clear that the presence of VTN is important as an extracellular tether for the formation of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 adhesions ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 , Zuidema et al . , 2018 ; Lock et al . , 2018 ) , the switch between these adhesion types is likely an inside - out mechanism . We did not detect an increase in integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 RAs on VTN - coated dishes ( Fig . 1 B ) . This could seem counterintuitive , but VTN , which was initially called a \u201c serum spreading factor \u201d ( Hayman et al . , 1983 ) , is readily secreted by cells during attachment . Therefore , we advise caution when making conclusions based on the results of non - coated and VTN - coated dishes on the role of this ECM component on RA coverage . Further work is necessary to shed light on this issue . Recent evidence showed that EGFR activation led to the en - largement of FCLs in an integrin \u03b2 5 phosphorylation - dependent manner ( Alfonzo - M\u00b4endez et al . , 2022 ) , pointing to a possible mechanism for the initial coassembly of FCLs and RAs . This possibility is further reinforced by the fact that the relationship between growth factor receptors and integrins has been estab - lished in multiple contexts ( Ivaska and Heino , 2011 ) . Another key unknown aspect of RA formation by FCL and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 coassembly concerns how these structures can be molec - ularly differentiated from canonical endocytic events . The con - nection between integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 located in RAs and FCLs occurs primarily via the endocytic adaptors ARH and NUMB ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , these adaptors also participate in in - tegrin endocytosis ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , suggesting that other mechanisms may be required to define the identity of FCLs . Recently , a correlation was found between the presence of clathrin plaques and an alternatively spliced isoform of clathrin containing exon 31 in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We did not detect any changes in clathrin splicing in our experimental system , which was not surprising given the effects we see are contact - dependent and could not be explained by transcriptional changes . In addition , we cannot ensure that the clathrin plaques detected in myotubes are equivalent to the FCLs we observe here . Nonetheless , it is possible that the abundance of the exon 31 - positive clathrin isoform works as a dial that changes the probability , speed , or efficiency by which cells form FCLs . Another unusual function of the clathrin machinery In addition to its endocytic function , the clathrin machinery has been shown to participate in other processes . For example , clathrin helps to stabilize the mitotic spindle by binding to mi - crotubules ( Royle , 2012 ) and , during E . coli infection , the CME machinery is co - opted to form a clathrin - based actin - rich ad - hesive structure for the bacteria called pedestal ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a clathrin / AP2 tubular lattice was re - cently described to envelop collagen fibers during cell migration ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . The results we present here add to this list of non - endocytic functions of CME components with an im - portant twist . FCLs can also be disassembled into individual endocytic events ( Lampe et al . , 2016 ; Tagiltsev et al . , 2021 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ) , providing an elegant and efficient mechanism for cells to switch the same machinery from an adhesion assembly to an adhesion disassembly function . Inhibition of CCAC and its relationship to cell migration In addition to defining FCLs as key factors in the establishment of CCACs , our work has also revealed many interesting aspects of the inhibition and disassembly of these structures . We show that activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 by FN and the capacity of this integrin heterodimer to form FBs are both essential for the in - hibition and disassembly of CCAC . In a classical wound healing assay , we observed that as cells start to migrate they secrete FN , leading to the disappearance of CCACs . However , using laterally confined cells that cannot form FBs , we observed that the mere presence of FN is not enough to inhibit CCACs . A recent study showed that high levels of activated myosin light chain ( p - MLC ) correlated with integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localizing to FAs over RAs ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) . Moreover , overexpression of a consti - tutively active RhoA mutant in a cell line with low p - MLC levels promoted integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 localization to FAs ( Zuidema et al . 2022 ) . Interestingly , expression of the very same RhoA mutant leads to increased FN secretion ( Danen et al . , 2002 ) . As Integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 - mediated FN fibrillogenesis is required for optimal acti - vation of the RhoA - MLC pathway , which in turn increases actin stress fiber - based migration along FBs ( Gagn\u00b4e et al . , 2020 ; Huveneers et al . , 2008 ; Danen et al . , 2002 ) , these findings per - fectly complement our data . Together , these results suggest that the disappearance of CCACs requires FN activation of integrin \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 followed by the activation of actin contractility during the cell migration process .

Similarly , whether the disas - sembly of CCACs occurs actively or is a mere consequence of a non - permissive environment for the de novo formation of new adhesions is still unknown . Given the fact that RAs are long - lasting cellular adhesion structures , it is tempting to hypothesize that these structures act as a \u201c parking brake \u201d for a cell . As the cell is triggered to migrate , this brake needs to be released for efficient cell movement . This process would be analogous to the loss of cell \u2013 cell contacts , which happens during epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( Kalluri and Weinberg , 2009 ) , but instead of happening between cells , it would happen between the cell and the ECM . Therefore , we propose that disassembly of RAs is an intrinsic process during cell migration . We showed that FN regulates CCAC assembly in all the cell lines we tested . However , how these in vitro findings will op - erate in vivo is still unknown . Even though the ECM composi - tion in tissues is complex , the FN effect on CCAC formation is local and strictly contact dependent , which opens the possibility that , in vivo , tissues may use focal changes in ECM composition to control these structures . Materials and methods Cell culture and reagents U2Os , U2Os - AP2 - GFP , U2Os - AP2 - halo , U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet , HeLa - AP2 - GFP , and HeLa - AP2 - halo were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) and penicillin \u2013 streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . HDF - AP2 - halo and Caco2 - AP2 - halo were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) and penicillin \u2013 streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . MCF7 - AP2 - halo was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco ) and penicillin \u2013 streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , 2 mM glu - tamine , 5 \u00b5g / ml human insulin , and 1 \u00b5M sodium pyruvate . hMEC - AP2 - GFP was cultured in MEGM complete medium ( Lonza ) . The following primary antibodies were used : anti - human integrin \u03b2 1 clones 12G10 ( NB100 - 63255 ; Novus bio ) , mAb13 ( 552828 ; BD ) , total integrin \u03b2 1 ( MAB2252 ; Millipore ) , anti - human integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 clone 15F11 ( MAB2019Z ; Millipore ) , anti - human integrin \u03b1 5 clone SNAKA51 ( AF1846 ; R & D ) , anti - human Tensin1 ( SAB4200283 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - human p - paxillin Y118 ( 69363 ; Cell Signaling ) , anti - human - Talin1 ( T3287 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , anti - \u03b1 - tubulin ( sc - 32293 ; SantaCruz Biotechnology ) , and anti - GAPDH ( G9545 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Corresponding sec - ondary antibodies raised against rabbit or mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch . Coating of imaging dishes To compare the effects of major ECM proteins on AP2 lifetimes , the glass coverslip areas ( 14 mm diameter ) of imaging dishes ( Mattek ) were precoated with 10 or 20 \u00b5g / ml ( 300 \u03bc l in PBS ) of the following ECM proteins : recombinant human FN ( 341631 ; Merck ) , recombinant human VTN ( 140 - 09 ; PeproTech ) , Col IV ( Santa cruz , se - 29010 ) , Col I ( C3867 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and LN111 ( # LN111 ; Biolamina ) . Coatings were incubated overnight at + 37\u00b0C , except Col I , which was incubated at RT overnight , and LN111 was incubated at + 4\u00b0C overnight . Alternatively , as non - ECM protein controls , 1 % BSA ( A34785 ; Thermo Fisher Scien - tific ) or 0 . 3 % PLL ( 152690 ; MP Biochemicals ) were used to coat the dishes overnight at + 37\u00b0C . Throughout this study , the stan - dard FN coating was always performed similarly , 10 \u00b5g / ml ( 300 \u03bc l in PBS ) , overnight at + 37\u00b0C . FN patterning To study local vs . global effects of FN , FN was mixed with 50 ng / ml of Alexa647 - labeled BSA and used to precoat the imaging dishes overnight at + 37\u00b0C . The coated surface was subsequently scratched with a needle to allow partial reappearance of non - coated surface . After scratching , the dishes were heavily rinsed with PBS . 20 , 000 U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were seeded on patterned imaging dishes to ensure sufficient single - cell attachment to border areas . Overexpression of mammalian proteins The clathrin inhibitor AP180 C - terminal fragment ( AP180 ct ; amino acids 516 \u2013 898 ) cDNA , from rat origin , was described previously ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . This construct was cloned into Gateway - compatible pCI vectors containing an N - terminal monomeric EGFP using the Gateway system . Transient transfections were carried out with PEI MAX transfection reagent ( 24765 - 1 ; Polysciences ) using 70 % confluent U2Os cells . Genetic engineering of cell lines Generating the U2Os - AP2 - GFP and hMEC - AP2 - GFP cell lines Three gRNA sequences ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) were designed using the Welcome Sanger Institute Genome online editing tool ( https : / / wge . stemcell . sanger . ac . uk / / ) . gRNAs were cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 ) V2 . 0 ( gift from .

The next day , U2Os cells were plated to reach confluency in 24 h . RNA extraction , cDNA syn - thesis , and PCR followed those described by Moulay et al . ( 2020 ) with minor variations . Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent with an additional acidic phenol ( pH 5 . 4 ) ex - traction step to remove genomic DNA contamination . cDNA synthesis from 1 \u00b5g total RNA was carried out using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Scien - tific ) and oligo dT12 \u2013 18 ( Life Technologies ) . No enzyme re - actions were included to confirm that no genomic DNA was present . PCR was performed using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Scientific ) with no other variations from Moulay et al . ( 2020 ) . Primers used were F 9 TGC CCTATTTCATCCAGGTCA and R 9 ATGGGTTGTGTCTCTGTAGC . Gel images were acquired using a GelDoc XL ( Bio Rad ) . Western blots U2Os were silenced for respective proteins , as mentioned above , and lysed into 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 , and 1 % NP - 40 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) .

The ONI Nanoimager microscope set to TIRF angle was used to acquire AP2 lifetimes at the cell membrane from 300 frames ( 1 frame / s ) with an exposure time of 330 ms . Each video rep - resents endocytic events from two to three cells ( total field of view ) . Acute manipulation of integrin activity Integrin \u03b2 1 blocking Acute modulation of ligand binding activity for integrin \u03b2 1 was achieved using the function - blocking antibody mab13 ( 0 . 3 \u00b5g / ml ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on FN , as explained above , and 16 \u2013 20 h later subjected to live TIRF imaging . 0 - min sample has no mab13 added to control baseline FCL proportions . Im - mediately after mab13 addition , 5 - min time lapses were con - tinuously collected until 35 min ; control videos ( time point 0 ) had no mab13 added . Integrin \u03b2 5 blocking To acutely induce the inhibition of integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 , we used the small molecular inhibitor Cilengitide ( HY - 16141 ; MedChem Ex - press , 10 \u00b5M ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated imag - ing dishes were treated with Cilengitide for 15 or 45 min , fixed , stained , and imaged with the ONI Nanoimager microscope at TIRF angle and analyzed for the resulting reduction of RA coverage . Cilengitide washout U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes and 1 d later confluent monolayers were treated with 1 \u00b5M Cilengitide for 15 \u2013 25 min , during which most FCLs and RAs were dissociated from the cell membrane . Samples were then washed twice and immediately subjected to live TIRF imaging to detect the de novo formation of FCLs and RAs . 1 - h time - lapses were acquired with the ONI Nanoimager micro - scope at TIRF angle , at 30 s intervals , with an exposure time of 100 ms for AP2 and 300 ms for integrin \u03b2 5 . Immunofluorescence experiments Immunofluorescent staining and imaging For immunofluorescence experiments , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde \u2013 PBS for 15 min in a + 37\u00b0C incubator , washed with PBS , and blocked with 1 % BSA - PBS . Primary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA \u2013 PBS were incubated for 1 h , samples were washed with PBS , and secondary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA \u2013 PBS were let to bind for 30 min . Samples were imaged with the ONI Nanoimager microscope using a TIRF angle and expo - sure times of 500 or 1 , 000 ms . Manipulation of CME machinery to study RA formation Clathrin assembly at the cell membrane was reduced by si - lencing two subdomains of AP2 or by overexpressing AP180 ct , which acts as a dominant negative for AP2 . U2Os AP2 - GFP cells silenced for AP2A1 shRNA # 1 and # 2 or AP2S1 shRNA # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , and control shRNA , and plated on non - coated imaging dishes were fixed and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax . Alternatively , AP180 ct was overexpressed in U2Os AP2 - GFP cells , and cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes , fixed the next day , and stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and p - Pax . RA for - mation ( integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 adhesions without FA marker ) and FAs ( integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 colocalizing with FA marker ) were imaged using TIRF microscopy . Manipulation of integrin activity and availability We performed time - series experiments to block integrin \u03b2 1 ac - tive conformation with the mab13 antibody or to inhibit integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 with Cilengitide . Experiments utilizing mab13 were per - formed with U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN - coated dishes to disfavor the preformation of FCLs and RAs . Mab13 ( 0 . 3 \u00b5g / ml ) was added to replicate samples and fixed 15 , 30 , or 45 min later . Similarly , U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes to favor the preformation of FCLs and RAs were treated with Cil - engitide . Samples were stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Cilengitide washout Cilengitide washout experiments were developed to study acute reappearance of FCLs and RAs in cell cultures . Cells were treated for 15 \u2013 25 min with 1 \u00b5M Cilengitide ( or DMSO as control ) and washed two times . Unwashed controls were collected . Washed samples were let to recover for indicated time points , fixed , stained for p - Pax , subjected to TIRF imaging , and analyzed for the reappearance of FCLs and RAs ( RA coverage ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin \u03b2 1 , integrin \u03b2 5 , integrin \u03b1 5 , or Tensin1 and controls were plated either on FN - coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB1 shRNAs , ITGA5 shRNAs , or TNS1 shRNAs ) or on non - coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB5 shRNAs ) and fixed the next day , 16 \u2013 20 h later . Samples were stained for integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 and FA marker p - Pax and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Micropatterning U2Os - AP2 - GFP or U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were seeded onto micropatterned glass coverslips ( CYTOO ) ei - ther precoated with FN 10 \u00b5g / ml or left uncoated . Excess amount ( 60 , 000 ) of cells were plated and monitored for attachment to the patterns . The cells plated on FN had at - tached in 1 h and the cells plated on non - coated micro - patterns had attached in 4 h . After attachment , excess cells were carefully rinsed and the samples were fixed 16 \u2013 20 h later , stained , and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with TIRF microscopy . Wound healing stimulated migration U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated confluent onto non - coated imaging dishes for 2 d . Fully confluent monolayers were wounded with a micropipette tip , washed twice with fresh complete medium , and let to migrate . 0 - min samples were col - lected directly after wounding . After fixing , samples were stained and subjected to TIRF imaging . Tile images ( 5 \u00d7 1 ) , starting at the edge of the wound , were acquired with a 25 % overlap and stitched using the pairwise stitching plug - in Image J . Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

For all experiments , \u201c n \u201d refers to a movie , which contained two to four cells . To determine the proportion of FCLs , we used the output from u - track to count the number of pits ( events lasting longer than 20 s and shorter than 120 s ) and the number of FCLs ( events lasting longer than 120 s , as described in Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) in all frames . We took a conservative approach to identify bona fide CME events ( i . e . clathrin coated pits \u2014 CCPs ) , where events that were present at the start or lasted beyond the end of the movies were not counted as CCPs . This approach artificially led to higher FCL proportions in the first and final 120 movie frames . Therefore , FCL proportions are presented as the average FCL proportion from frames 120 \u2013 175 for each movie . Other analyses With the exception of FCL proportions , all image analyses were performed using ImageJ . Simple fluorescence measurements were done manually . Others were performed using custom scripts as shown below . RA ( and FA ) coverage Individual cells were marked , and ITGB5 ( or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) and p - Pax channels were transformed into binary masks using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . The Robust Automatic Threshold Selection parameters used for segmentation ( \u201c noise , \u201d \u201c lambda , \u201d and \u201c min \u201d ) were defined by visual inspection for each experiment . The mask of the p - Pax channel was then subtracted from the mask of the ITGB5 ( or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) channel using the \u201c image calculation \u201d function . This calculation results in a mask con - taining only the RAs ( i . e . , ITGB5 [ or \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ] signals not colocal - izing with p - Pax ) . RA coverage was then calculated by dividing the area covered by RAs in the RA mask ( integrated density / 255 ) by the area of each marked cell ( or cells ) in the image . An il - lustration of this method is shown in Fig . S6 . Data is presented as a percentage of the cell area covering RAs . Focal adhesion coverage ( Fig . S2 A ) was calculated by divid - ing the area of the p - Pax mask by the area of each marked cell ( or cells ) in the image . For the wound healing experiment , a line on the migration front of each image was manually drawn . This line was then used as a reference to automatically draw a box 100 pixels in width ( 11 . 7 \u00b5m ) . RA coverage ( as above ) was calculated for this box , which was then moved inward in the culture in 50 - pixel steps , where the RA coverage analysis was repeated . Values are normalized to the average RA coverage on the three innermost areas in the culture . AP2 - ITGB5 dynamics Events showing the appearance of both AP2 and ITGB5 were identified by visual inspection of videos . For the generation of graphs , we selected only events where we could unambiguously ensure that significant FCLs and ITGB5 signals were not present in the region for at least 3 min . For the events where an RA was established ( Fig . 5 B , left ) , time zero was defined as the frame where AP2 signal appeared , and fluorescence intensity from a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m region around each event was measured for 3 min before ( six frames ) and 5 min after ( 10 frames ) . For the events where ITGB5 clusters did not result in established RAs ( Fig . 5 B , right ) , time zero was defined as the frame where the ITGB5 signal disappeared . Fluorescence was normalized to the highest value in these frames . AP2 intensity per colocalization status AP2 , ITGB5 , and p - Pax channels were segmented using the Ro - bust Automatic Threshold Selection function ( similarly to what was done in the RA coverage experiments ) . Individual AP2 spots were identified as regions of interest ( ROIs ) using the \u201c analyze particles \u201d function . The fluorescence intensity for each AP2 spot ( i . e . , ROI ) was then measured from the original image . Using the same AP2 ROIs in the ITGB5 and p - Pax binary masks , we then classified each AP2 spot for their colocalization with either marker . In this case , an AP2 ROI with a non - zero signal in either mask was considered colocalizing . We used full images for these analyses . RAs colocalizing to AP2 Individual cells were marked and AP2 , ITGB5 , and p - Pax chan - nels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were defined as ITGB5 signals not co - localizing with p - Pax . In the conditions used for these experi - ments ( FN + mab13 ) , RAs were primarily individual spots . The colocalization of RAs to AP2 was classified by measuring the intensity of each RA region at the segmented AP2 channel . FN intensity vs . AP2 intensity AP2 , ITGB5 , and P - Pax channels were segmented using the Ro - bust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the fluorescence intensity measured from the original image . A 3 \u00b5m \u00d7 3 \u00b5m region was drawn around each AP2 spot and used to measure the intensity of FN from the original image . Data are presented as the fluorescence for each AP2 spot . Statistics Figure legends state the exact n - values and individual repeats used in analyses . For multiple comparisons , one - way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey \u2019 s multiple comparison . Pair - wise comparisons were performed using two - tailed Student \u2019 s t test with two - tailed distributions . Data distributions were as - sumed to be normal , but this was not formally tested . All graphs and statistical calculations were performed with GraphPad Prism 9 . Online supplemental material Fig .

Illustration of the RA coverage calculation method . To calculate RA coverage , images of the integrin ( \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 ) and paxillin ( p - Pax ) channels are segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection method in ImageJ . This method generates binary masks for each channel . The paxillin channel is then subtracted from the integrin channel and results in a mask containing only the RAs . RA coverage is calculated by dividing the area covered by RAs in pixels ( integrated density / 255 ) by the area covered by the cell ( or cells ) in an image . Hakanp\u00a8a\u00a8a et al .

This con - trols various functions ranging from fluid - phase nutrient uptake and spatially and temporally regulated traffic of adhesion and growth - factor receptors , to pathogen entry 1 . The predomi - nant view is that the specificity of endocytosis is achieved through cargo - specific adaptors , as described for clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) 2 , 3 . This raises the possibility that as - yet unidentified cargo adaptor proteins could function as key gatekeepers for other endosomal routes . The clathrin - and dynamin - independent endocytic pathway ( CG pathway ) internalizes a major fraction of the extracellular fluid phase , glycosylphosphotidylinositol - anchored proteins and other cell surface receptors\u2014including nutrient transporters , ion channels and cell adhesion receptors 4 , 5 \u2014as well as bacterial and viral pathogens 4 , 6 . This occurs through high - capacity tubulove - sicular membrane uptake carriers called clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) 7 , 8 . CLICs are formed via the recruitment of Arf1 , the actin - binding BAR - domain protein IRSp53 and Arp2 / 3 to the membrane , followed by Cdc42 activation of IRSp53 and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , presumptively resulting in the scission of CLICs and generation of CG endosomes 9 . Although the core machinery of CG - endocytosis has been defined , no cargo - specific adaptors are known 10 . The small GTPase Rab21 binds directly to integrins to regulate endo / exosomal traffic , cytokinesis , chromosome integrity , endo - somal signalling and anoikis 11 \u2013 14 . Rab21 interacts with integrins independently of its activation state ( GDP / GTP ) ; nevertheless , inte - grin endocytosis requires Rab21 activity , but the exact mechanism is currently unknown 11 . In addition , very few Rab21 interactors have been identified 15 . Here we identify Swiprosin - 1 ( Swip1 , EFHD2 ) as an interactor of Rab21 and a cargo - specific adaptor for CG - endocytosis . Results Swip1 interacts with Rab21 and \u03b2 1 - integrin . To identify Rab21 - interacting proteins , we performed proteomic analyses by stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) of cells expressing wild - type ( WT ) Rab21 , the constitutively active Rab21 Q76L mutant ( CA - Rab21 ) or the Rab21 T31N inactive mutant 16 , 17 . This mass - spectrometry strategy identified the actin - binding pro - tein Swip1 as a putative active Rab21 interactor ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1a \u2013 d and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Green fluorescent pro - tein ( GFP ) pulldowns from the cell lysates demonstrated endoge - nous Swip1 preferably bound to WT and CA - Rab21 , and not to the closely related Rab5 GTPase ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 1e ) . Moreover , purified recombinant glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) \u2013 Swip1 interacted directly with GTP - analogue - loaded recombinant Cargo - specific recruitment in clathrin - and dynamin - independent endocytosis Paulina Moreno - Layseca 1 , 2 , Niklas Z .

Unlike cargo - specific clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the clathrin - and dynamin - independent endocytic pathway ( CLIC - GEEC , CG pathway ) is considered a bulk internalization route for the fluid phase , glycosylated membrane proteins and lipids . While the core molecular players of CG - endocytosis have been recently defined , evidence of cargo - specific adaptors or selective uptake of proteins for the pathway are lacking . Here we identify the actin - binding protein Swiprosin - 1 ( Swip1 , EFHD2 ) as a cargo - specific adaptor for CG - endocytosis . Swip1 couples active Rab21 - associated integrins with key components of the CG - endocytic machin - ery\u2014Arf1 , IRSp53 and actin\u2014and is critical for integrin endocytosis . Through this function , Swip1 supports integrin - dependent cancer - cell migration and invasion , and is a negative prognostic marker in breast cancer . Our results demonstrate a previously unknown cargo selectivity for the CG pathway and a role for specific adaptors in recruitment into this endocytic route .

We next validated the interaction in cells , where Swip1 localized to GFP \u2013 Rab21 - containing endosomes ( Fig . 2a ) and a proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) indicated endogenous Swip1 and Rab21 association in intact cells ( Fig . 2b ) . Rab21 localizes with membrane - proximal puncta and early endosomes positive for endocytosed active \u03b2 1 - integrins 11 , 14 , 20 . Concordantly , bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) 21 revealed an interaction between Swip1 and Rab21 in structures overlapping predominantly with EEA1 , Rab5 and VPS35 , and to a lesser extent with late endo - some markers ( Extended Data Fig . 2a \u2013 c ) . Furthermore , Swip1 localized to Rab21 - positive , \u03b2 1 - integrin - containing endosomes ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . These data indicate that Swip1 interacts with integrin - associated Rab21 in cells . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy of endo - cytic events on the plasma membrane revealed split Venus - tagged Rab21 and Swip1 ( V1 \u2013 Rab21 and V2 \u2013 Swip1 ) complexes mov - ing at the cell \u2013 extracellular matrix ( ECM ) interface in live cells 9 , 22 ( Fig . 2c ) . The BiFC interaction puncta were dynamic , detected at the cell periphery and in the cell centre , and absent in the Venus - expressing control cells ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) images of the cell \u2013 ECM interface revealed that Swip1 , Rab21 and \u03b2 1 - integrin - positive structures extended ver - tically into the cell ( Fig . 2d , e , x \u2013 z projections and Extended Data Fig . 3b ) . In these structures , Swip1 co - localized substantially more with Rab21 than Rab5 , Rab7 and Rab11 ( Extended Data Fig . 3c ) , indicating a degree of specificity for Rab21 binding . Together , these data identify Swip1 as an interactor of active Rab21 , overlapping with \u03b2 1 - integrins in endosomal compartments and in close prox - imity with the plasma membrane . Swip1 associates with CG - pathway components . Interestingly , Arf1 was detected as an active Rab21 interactor alongside Swip1 ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1a \u2013 d ) , prompting us to test whether Rab21 and / or Swip1 associate with Arf1 . Arf1 is a known regulator of CG - endocytosis , where cargo uptake is mediated by tubulovesic - ular membrane invaginations 23 . Both GFP \u2013 Rab21 and GFP \u2013 Swip1 co - immunoprecipitated with endogenous Arf1 ( Fig . 3a ) . In addition , another CG - endocytosis regulator , IRSp53 ( ref . 10 ) , was detected in the GFP immunoprecipitations ( Fig . 3a ) , and immunoprecipitation of endogenous IRSp53 co - precipitated endogenous Swip1 and Arf1 ( Fig . 3b ) . Moreover , significant PLA signal between IRSp53 and active \u03b2 1 - integrin ( 12G10 active - integrin conformation - specific antibody ) showed close proximity of the endogenous proteins ( Fig . 3c ) . These data indicate that the Rab21 \u2013 \u03b2 1 - integrin \u2013 Swip1 complex is associated with the CG - endocytosis machinery . To investigate this in more detail , we imaged Swip1 co - localization with known components of CME , caveolin - mediated endocytosis and CG - endocytosis using SIM . Swip1 co - localized significantly more with Rab21 , Arf1 and IRSp53 than with clathrin , the clath - rin adaptor AP2 , caveolin or dynamin II ( Fig . 3d , e ) . These data are consistent with Rab21 - mediated integrin endocytosis remain - ing unaffected by clathrin inhibition 12 , the clathrin and caveolin endocytic pathway components not being enriched in the active Rab21 mass - spectrometry fractions ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1a \u2013 d ) and the absence of dynamin I / II in bimolecular comple - mentation affinity purified 21 V1 \u2013 Rab21 and V2 \u2013 Swip1 complexes in cells ( Fig . 3f ) . Furthermore , we detected ring - like structures of GFP \u2013 Swip1 co - localizing with haemagglutinin ( HA ) \u2013 Arf1 at the TIRF plane using another super - resolution microscopy tech - nique , DNA - PAINT 24 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , Rab21 \u2013 Swip1 BiFC puncta were detected dynamically moving towards IRSp53 - positive structures before disappearing from the TIRF plane in live cells ( Fig . 3g and Supplementary Video 2 ) . These data indicate the existence of a Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 \u2013 GTP complex that links to the CG - endocytosis machinery . Active \u03b2 1 - integrin endocytosis via Swip1 is Rab21 depen - dent .

Swip1 silencing - induced inhibition of integrin endocytosis was apparent at the 5 min time point and persisted for up to 30 min ( Fig . 4a ) . Ectopic expression of RNA interference - resistant GFP \u2013 Swip1 res - cued \u03b2 1 - integrin endocytosis in Swip1 - silenced cells and increased the uptake in control short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - transfected cells ( Fig . 4b ) . Reduced integrin uptake was specifically due to Swip1 silencing and not lower integrin levels , as evidenced by the total \u03b2 1 - integrin protein levels remaining unaffected by Swip1 silencing along with the surface levels of total , active and inac - tive \u03b2 1 - integrins ( Extended Data Fig . 4b , c ) . We then investigated whether the Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 complex could discriminate between active and inactive \u03b2 1 - integrins . Internalization of inactive \u03b2 1 - integrin ( Mab13 antibody ) was unaffected by Swip1 or Rab21 silencing ( Fig . 4c ) . These data are in line with previous reports of active \u03b2 1 - integrins signalling from Rab21 endosomes 14 and the Rab21 \u2013 integrin interaction requiring the conserved KR - residues within the integrin \u03b1 - subunit cytoplasmic - tail GFFKR motif 11 . Thus , this process potentially interferes with conserved salt - bridge interactions ( between \u03b1 - subunit R and the conserved acidic resi - due of the \u03b2 - cytoplasmic domain ) known to stabilize integrins in their inactive conformation 25 . To assess the impact of Rab21 in the Swip1 - mediated recruit - ment of integrins , we mutated the key Rab21 - interacting residues ( KR1160 / 1161AA ) in the integrin \u03b1 2 - subunit 11 , 14 . This signifi - cantly reduced integrin co - localization with Swip1 - positive struc - tures ( Fig . 4d ) . Furthermore , co - localization of \u03b2 1 - integrin with Swip1 was reduced in Rab21 - silenced cells ( Fig . 4e ) , indicating that a preserved integrin \u2013 Rab21 interaction is required for the Swip1 - mediated recruitment of the integrin receptor . In line with Rab21 interacting with multiple integrin \u03b1 - subunits 11 , we found that Swip1 and Rab21 co - precipitated with several distinct GFP - tagged integrin \u03b1 - subunits ( Fig . 4f ) . Importantly , Swip1 silencing decreased the internalization of \u03b2 1 - integrin and several different \u03b1 - subunits ( Fig . 4g and Extended Data Fig . 4d ) .

Furthermore , integrin endocytosis was impaired in IRSp53 - null mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . This was specifically due to reduced integrin uptake and not lower integrin levels , given that the levels of total integrin were unaffected by the loss of IRSp53 ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . Overexpression of ectopic GFP \u2013 Swip1 clearly increased integrin uptake ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) . This was dependent on the CG - pathway machinery , as depletion of IRSp53 abolished GFP \u2013 Swip1 overexpression - induced \u03b2 1 - integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 4h ) . The ability of ectopic Swip1 to augment \u03b2 1 - integrin endocytosis was most probably due to the Swip1 overexpression - augmented recruitment of \u03b2 1 - integrins to IRSp53 ( Fig . 4i and Extended Data Fig . 5d ) . Together , these data link Swip1 with \u03b2 1 - integrin endocytosis by the CG pathway under basal conditions . Swip1 is a cargo adaptor for the CG pathway . CG - endocytosis is the major route for the bulk uptake / internalization of different kinds of cargo 5 , whereas Rab21 has been primarily linked to integrin inter - nalization 11 . To explore the possibility that \u03b2 1 - integrins enter the CG pathway , we imaged the uptake of plasma membrane - labelled active \u03b2 1 - integrin with 10 kDa dextran ; a fluid - phase cargo for the CG pathway . Immediately after endocytosis ( 2 and 5 min ) , inte - grins and dextran co - localized as clearly as dextran labelled with two different dyes ( Fig . 5a ) . Moreover , a large proportion of active \u03b2 1 - integrin ( around 50 % ) co - localized with endocytosed dextran , while around 20 % co - localized with transferrin ( Extended Data Fig . 5e ) , indicating that both the CME and CG pathways are active and facilitate the uptake of active integrins . To assess whether Swip1 is a cargo adaptor or an integral member of the CG pathway , we investigated whether it regulates the endocytosis of other CG car - gos . Swip1 silencing had no effect on the uptake of 10 kDa dextran or major histocompatibility complex I ( MHCI ; Fig . 5b , c ) . In con - trast , silencing of IRSp53 significantly impaired endocytosis of both cargos , thereby validating the approach . Similar data were obtained in two additional triple - negative breast adenocarcinoma ( TNBC ) cell lines , MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 , where Swip1 silencing signifi - cantly reduced \u03b2 1 - integrin uptake but not MHCI uptake ( Fig . 5d and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . The effect on \u03b2 1 - integrin endocyto - sis was more prominent in the MDA - MB - 468 cells , which express higher levels of endogenous Swip1 than the BT - 20 cells ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . Furthermore , Swip1 depletion did not affect the endo - cytosis of transferrin or EGFR ( Extended Data Fig . 6c , d ) , which are internalized through CME or dynamin - dependent non - clathrin endocytosis 26 , 27 . Thus , Swip1 regulates endocytosis of \u03b2 1 - integrin , but not of other CG cargos , which is indicative of a role for Swip1 as an integrin - specific CG - cargo adaptor . The CG pathway responds specifically to transient changes in the cell - membrane tension . The constitutive activity of the pathway is augmented following a strain relaxation , such as moving cells from hypotonic to isotonic medium , leading to a decrease in mem - brane tension 28 . Treatment of cells with hypotonic medium , fol - lowed by a shift to isotonic medium , notably increased the uptake of 10 kDa dextran and \u03b2 1 - integrin compared with the cells in iso - tonic medium . Although dextran uptake was similarly elevated in control - and Swip1 - silenced cells , when the cells were moved from hypotonic to isotonic medium , the \u03b2 1 - integrin uptake did not increase in the Swip1 - silenced cells following this treatment , in line with the idea of Swip1 specifically facilitating \u03b2 1 - integrin uptake through the CG pathway ( Fig . 5e and Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . This observation further confirmed \u03b2 1 - integrin as a Swip1 recruited cargo for the CG pathway . Swip1 and Arf1 direct integrin cargo towards CG - endocytosis . To investigate the mechanism through which Swip1 provides cargo specificity to the CG pathway , we silenced Rab21 and assessed the co - localization of the CG - pathway component IRSp53 . After Rab21 silencing , co - localization of IRSp53 with Swip1 was significantly reduced , indicating that recruitment of Swip1 to the CG pathway is dependent on binding to Rab21 and \u03b2 1 - integrin ( Fig . 5f ) . Swip1 did not interact with IRSp53 directly , while IRSp53 still associ - ated with VASP , a known IRSp53 interactor 29 \u2013 31 ( Extended Data Fig . 7b , c ) . We then explored the possible link between Swip1 and Arf1 . Unexpectedly , we found that Swip1 associates preferentially and specifically with the inactive Arf1mutant ( Arf1 T31N ) but not the active Arf1 ( Arf1 Q71L ; Fig . 5g ) . Arf1 localization at the plasma mem - brane precedes the formation of CG - endocytic tubules and its acti - vation is required for CG - endocytosis 9 , 32 . Given that Swip1 neither activates the CG pathway nor an integral part of it , we propose a model where Swip1 targets Rab21 - bound integrins to the CG path - way as a pre - assembled module with inactive Arf1 , which is then recruited to the endocytic CG machinery .

Intrigued by the estab - lished actin - binding activity of Swip1 ( ref . 34 ) , we investigated whether this function was important for Swip1 - mediated integ - rin CG - endocytosis . Deletion of the first EF - hand domain ( EF1 ) rendered Swip1 unable to bind actin , concordant with a previous report 34 , and abolished its ability to facilitate integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 6a \u2013 c ) . In contrast , EF2 deletion had no significant effect on Swip1 - induced integrin uptake . This indicates that binding of Swip1 to actin is necessary for its ability to induce integrin endocytosis . SIM imaging revealed F - actin overlap with Swip1 and \u03b2 1 - integrin close to the cell \u2013 ECM interface ( Fig . 6d ) , indicating that Swip1 and the actin cytoskeleton are in close proximity during integrin endocytosis . In addition to Swip1 localization to cell \u2013 ECM - proximal struc - tures , we observed Swip1 deeper in the cell , where it overlapped with Rab21 - positive endosome - like vesicles ( Fig . 6e ) and F - actin in discrete puncta around Rab21 vesicles ( Fig . 6e , yellow arrows , and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Similar localization was visual - ized using GBP - APEX ( GFP - binding protein soybean ascorbate peroxidase ) - labelled GFP \u2013 Swip1 imaged with electron microscopy ( Fig . 6f ) 35 . Swip1 localized to filaments close to the plasma mem - brane and in the vicinity of endosomes ( Fig . 6e , f , pink arrow and blue arrows , respectively ) . Swip1 localization with actin on Rab21 endosomes prompted us to investigate whether Swip1 regulates the movement of endosomes . Silencing of Swip1 notably reduced the speed of GFP \u2013 Rab21 vesicles , but not the number of vesicles ( Extended Data Fig . 7d ) , and restricted their subcellular distribu - tion to the cell periphery ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Videos 4 , 5 ) . The motility of Rab21 vesicles was actin - dependent , as the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D reduced the vesicle speed ( Fig . 6h ) , con - sistent with previous observations 11 . Furthermore , re - expression of WT Swip1 , but not the actin binding - deficient EF1 - deleted Swip1 , fully restored the vesicle speed ( Fig . 6i and Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . Together , these data highlight a role for actin in both Swip1 / Rab21 - dependent integrin CG - endocytosis and Rab21 - mediated integrin endosomal traffic in the cell ( Fig . 6j ) . Swip1 regulates adhesion turnover , migration and invasion . Integrin endocytosis and intracellular transport are crucial for inte - grin turnover , cell migration and invasion 15 , 36 . Concordant with this idea , we found that vinculin - containing focal adhesions accu - mulated in Swip1 - silenced cells on collagen I - , fibronectin - and laminin - coated surfaces ( Fig . 7a ) . This phenotype was also present in cells silenced for Arf1 or IRSp53 ( Extended Data Fig . 8b ) , indicat - ing that CG - endocytosis of integrins may regulate adhesion dynam - ics and cell motility . Using live - cell imaging of paxillin - positive focal adhesions , we observed clearly slower rates of adhesion assembly and disassembly in Swip1 - silenced cells compared with the control cells ( Fig . 7b ) . Furthermore , live imaging of BiFC Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 complexes and paxillin revealed significant enrichment of BiFC signal in close proximity to focal adhesions , indicating that , at the ventral surface of the cell , the Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 interaction occurs pref - erentially in the vicinity of adhesion sites ( Fig . 7c and Supplementary Video 6 ) . Swip1 regulation of focal adhesions correlated with nota - bly impaired cell migration ( Fig . 7d and Extended Data Fig . 8c ) , in line with previously reported migration defects of IRSp53 - null fibroblasts 31 . Swip1 silencing also inhibited the migration speed of randomly migrating MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 cells ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) as well as the invasion of MDA - MB - 231 cells through a three - dimensional collagen matrix ( Fig . 7e ) . These data indicate that Swip1 supports integrin adhesion dynamics , in concert with the migration and invasion of TNBC cells . High Swip1 levels are a negative prognostic factor in TNBC . To assess the clinical relevance of our findings , we analysed Swip1 expression in a cohort of human breast cancer samples . Quantitative PCR analyses of the Swip1 messenger RNA levels of 192 breast can - cer specimens revealed that Swip1 expression was significantly increased in the highest - grade tumours and the most metastatic breast cancer subtypes : HER2 + and TNBC ( Extended Data Fig . 10 ) . These findings were further validated by immunohistochemistry of Swip1 in HER2 + and TNBC tissue microarrays ( Extended Data Fig . 10b ) . Swip1 was highly expressed in a large proportion of both breast tumour subtypes ( 65 \u2013 75 % ) . However , high Swip1 staining was only associated with a poorer clinical outcome in TNBC ( Fig . 7f ) . Moreover , we found that patients with high expression levels of Swip1 on the plasma membrane had a more pronounced correlation with poor clinical outcome ( Extended Data Fig . 10c , d ) . Importantly , the Cox proportional hazards model showed that high membranal expression levels of Swip1 is associated with a poorer prognosis after adjustment for Ki67 - positivity , tumour size , lymph node metastasis or tumour grade ( Extended Data Fig . 10d ) . Finally , we observed that TNBC patients with high levels of membranal Swip1 had sig - nificantly more lymph node metastasis compared with patients with Fig . 5 | Swip1 is a cargo adaptor for the CG pathway . a , Double uptake ( indicated by arrows ) of fluorescently labelled 10 kDa dextran \u2013 tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) with either fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated dextran or Alexa Fluor ( AF ) 488 - conjugated anti - \u03b2 1 - integrin antibody ( 12G10 , \u03b2 1 - integrin \u2013 AF488 ) in MDA - MB - 231 cells for the indicated times ( right ) .

These data demonstrate that elevated Swip1 levels strongly and independently correlate with breast cancer metastasis and reduced survival in TNBC . These findings support the use of Swip1 as a prognostic marker for TNBC and as a potential drug target for this clinically challenging breast cancer subtype . Discussion Swip1 has not been previously associated with endocytosis , and evidence for specific cargo adaptors or selective uptake in the CG - endocytosis pathway has been lacking . Our findings place Swip1 as a validated cargo - specific adaptor for the CG pathway . Swip1 directs active Rab21 and \u03b2 1 - integrins to the CG pathway and is necessary for active integrin endocytosis through this route , while c b Internalized dextran Internalized \u03b2 1 - integrin 0 200 400 600 1 , 000 1 , 500 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) * * * * * * * * NS NS S w i p 1 s i R N A 2 S w i p 1 s i R N A 1 s i C T R L I R S p53 s i R N A 2 s i C T R L I R S p5 3 s i R N A 1 0 100 200 300 400400600 S w i p1 s i R N A 2 s i C T R L * * * * * * * * * * * * * s i C T R L S w i p 1 s i R N A 1 I R S p53 s i R N A 2 I R S p5 3 s i R N A 1 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) s i C T R L I R S p53 s i RN A 1 I R S p53 s i RN A 2 s i C T R L S w i p1 s i RN A 1 MHCI MHCI MHCI 0 100 200 300 400 500 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) NS * * * * S w i p 1 s i R N A 1 s i C T R L I R S p5 3 s i R N A 1 S w i p1 s i RN A 2 \u03b2 1 - Integrin \u03b2 1 - Integrin Dextran Dextran \u03b2 1 - Integrin \u03b2 1 - Integrin Dextran Dextran \u03b2 1 - Integrin \u03b2 1 - Integrin Dextran Dextran s i C T R L S w i p1 s i RN A 1 I R S p53 s i RN A 1 BT - 20 Internalized \u03b2 1 - integrin 0 100 200 300 800400 * * * * * S w i p1 s i RN A 2 1 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) BT - 20 internalized MHCI 0 100200300 800 400 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) 500600 NS NS siCTRL MDA - MB - 468 Internalized MHCI MDA - MB - 468 internalized \u03b2 1 - integrin * * * * * NS NS 0 200 400 600 0 100 200 300 500 1 , 000 400 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) Input IVBs G S T G S T \u2013 S w i p1 G S T G S T \u2013 S w i p1 A r f 1 T 31 N A r f 1 Q 71L Arf 1 T31N Arf 1 Q71L Ponceau HA 5040 30 60 20 30 20 10 S w i p1 s i RN A 2 1 siCTRL S w i p1 s i RN A 2 1 siCTRL S w i p1 s i RN A 2 1 siCTRL d f Size ( kDa ) Size ( kDa ) e 0 20 40 60 80 Time ( min ) Dextran \u2013 FITC \u03b2 1 - Integrin \u2013 AF488 C o - l o c a li z ed s po t s ( % ) 2 5 100 NS NS a g Internalized dextran N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) 0 200 400 600 800 + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 siCTRL + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Internalized \u03b2 1 - integrin 0 100 200 300300450 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * NS NS siCTRL siRab21 0 30 40 10 20 C o - l o c a li z ed s po t s ( % ) * * * * x z x z IRSp53mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 IRSp53mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 s i C T R L s i R ab21 Dextran \u2013 TMR \u03b2 1 - Integrin \u2013 AF488 Hypotonicshock S w i p1 s i RN A 1 Hypotonicshock S w i p1 s i RN A 2 siCTRL S w i p1 s i RN A 1 S w i p1 s i RN A 2 NAtuRE CELL BIOLOGy | VOL 23 | OCTOBER 2021 | 1073 \u2013 1084 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 1080 Articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGy g Swip1 siRNA1 Swip1 siRNA h A v e r age s peed o f G F P \u2013 R ab21 v e s i c l e s ( \u00b5 m h \u2013 1 ) j e A v e r age s peed o f G F P \u2013 R ab21 v e s i c l e s ( \u00b5 m h \u2013 1 ) A v e r age s peed o f G F P \u2013 R ab21 v e s i c l e s ( \u00b5 m h \u2013 1 ) d F - actinmScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 Merge x z Calnexin s i C T R L Swip1 \u03b2 1 - Integrin mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 1 240 SH3 EF1 EF2 Coiled - coil a Endocytosed \u03b2 1 - integrin N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) b c G F P G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 1 G F P \u2013 S w i p1 IP GFP Lysate G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 2 G F P G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 1 G F P \u2013 S w i p1 G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 2 \u03b2 - Actin 0 100 200 300500 1 , 000 G F P G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 1 G F P \u2013 S w i p1 G F P \u2013 \u2206 E F 2 * * NS * f siCTRL Swip1 siRNA2 * * * 0 5 , 000 10 , 000 15 , 000 5 , 000 10 , 000 15 , 000 0 * * * * * GFP \u2013 Rab21 mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 F - actin x y F - actin Rab21 Swip1 ( i ) Merge ( i ) Swip1siRNA 2 1 Size ( kDa ) 5037 25 5037 IRSp53 Arf1 GTP Actin CLIC Endosome Cytosol Swip1Rab21 \u2013 GTP Arf1 IRSp53Actin i m S c a r l e t - I \u2013 \u2206 E F 1 m S c a r l e t - I \u2013 S w i p1 s i C T R L s i S w i p1 5 , 000 6 , 000 7 , 000 4 , 000 Integrin Rab21 GTP Swip1Arf1 GDP * * * * * * * * NS 37 100 Size ( kDa ) D M S O 10 \u00b5 M c y t o c ha l a s i n D ( i ) ( ii ) 2 1 siCTRL ( i ) ( ii ) Fig . 6 | Swip1 \u2013 actin binding regulates integrin traffic . a , Swip1 domains .

This dem - onstrates an important and unexpected feature of this pathway\u2014the cargo - specific adaptor - based recruitment of receptors . It also high - lights the possibility of unprecedented cargo - selective functions for the CG pathway in a manner similar to that described for numerous other endocytosed proteins following different endocytosis routes . We find that IRSp53 is required for CG - pathway uptake of inte - grins and that this is important for efficient cell migration and invasion . This adds a pathway to the list of IRSp53 - regulated cell migration and invasion mechanisms , including filopodia genera - tion 29 , 37 , membrane ruffling 38 and curvature sensing with WAVE at the neck of membrane invaginations 39 . Moreover , our findings shed light on previous studies demonstrating that Arf1 depletion results in defective adhesion and migration in MDA - MB - 231 cells 40 \u2013 42 . Integrin traffic is a key regulator of cell motility and adhesion dynamics in many different contexts 43 \u2013 45 . We show that Arf1 deple - tion notably inhibits integrin uptake and induces the accumulation of large focal adhesions , similarly to Swip1 and IRSp53 silencing . These data link integrin uptake via the CG pathway to the regula - tion of cell adhesion . It has been shown that Arf1 is recruited to the forming endocytic pit long before scission and that Arf1 activation is a key regulatory step in promoting endocytosis via the CG path - way 9 , 23 . Our observation that Swip1 associates with inactive Arf1 supports a model where inactive Arf1 associates with the Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 \u2013 GTP \u2013 integrin complex and thereby concentrates the inte - grin cargo at the site of the forming pit . Subsequently , activation of Arf1 releases the cargo from its adaptor for association with actin , which persists during endocytosis through the CG pathway . Interestingly , knockout of Swip - 1 in Drosophila results in a mild adhesion defect similar to the deletion of the Rho - GAP - domain - containing protein GRAF1 , another regulator of CLIC formation , suggesting an in vivo relevant role for Swip1 in the regulation of cell \u2013 ECM interactions 32 , 46 . We find that Swip1 facilitates cancer - cell migration in vitro and that high Swip1 cor - relates with increased cancer dissemination in patients , in line with Swip1 driving increased actin protrusion and migration in meta - static lung adenocarcinoma cells 47 . In macrophages , inflammatory shock - induced migration is Swip1 - dependent 48 , 49 , while Swip1 dele - tion in mice induces faster B - cell migration in vivo ; suggesting cell type - and possibly migration mode - specific roles for Swip1 ( ref . 50 ) . Importantly , these studies focus on the role of Swip1 as an actin reg - ulator and the potential role of integrin traffic was not investigated . Here we show that Swip1 acts as a cargo - specific adaptor that bridges the CG - endocytic machinery to Rab21 - bound integ - rins , and couples Rab21 endosomes and their motility in cells to the actin cytoskeleton . This dual functionality of Swip1 regulates cell - adhesion turnover , migration and invasion . Perhaps unsurpris - ingly , given the importance of these events in cancer progression , Swip1 expression has clinically relevant implications for TNBC . Thus , Swip1 and the mechanism of its interaction with Rab21 offer potentially exciting therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer .

MDA - MB - 231 was authenticated by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH , using short - tandem - repeat profiling and PCR assays to test the presence of mitochondrial DNA sequences from rodent cells , such as mouse , rat and Chinese and Syrian hamster cells . The other cell lines used in the study were not authenticated . Plasmids of interest were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or jetPRIME ( Polyplus transfection ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . The expression of proteins of interest was suppressed using 27 nM siRNA and Lipofectamine siRNA max ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . The siRNA used as control ( siCTRL ) was Allstars negative control siRNA ( Qiagen , cat . no . 1027281 ) . The siRNA oligonucleotides targeting Swip1 were purchased from Sigma ( siRNA1 , cat . no .

Plasmids . Human Rab21 ( amino acids 16 \u2013 225 ) constructs were cloned into the Gateway destination vector pgLAP1 ( Addgene , plasmid 19702 ) to express Rab21 with an amino - terminal GFP , followed by a TEV cleavage site and an S - Tag in mammalian cells . We used pCR8 / GW / Topo ( Thermo Fisher ) , in which human Rab21 was cloned by TOPO cloning , as the entry vector . The Rab21 mutants Q76L ( active ) and T33N ( inactive ) were introduced into the entry clone by site - directed mutagenesis . Mouse full - length Swip1 , \u2206 EF1 - Swip1 ( deletion in the EF1 domain , amino acids 96 \u2013 166 ) and \u2206 EF2 - Swip1 ( deletion at the EF2 domain , amino acids 134 \u2013 159 ) were a gift from D . Mielenz ( Division of Molecular Immunology , Nikolaus Fiebiger Centre , University of Erlangen \u2013 Nuremberg , Germany ) . The corresponding coding sequences were subcloned into the pEGFP - N1 backbone vector using the XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites . Full - length Swip1 was also subcloned by TOPO cloning into the Gateway vector pCR8 / GW / Topo . Next , a LR clonase II reaction was performed to shuttle full - length Swip1 into pGEX - 4T1 ; mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 was generated from the GFP - tagged construct by introducing the mScarlet - I sequence using the AgeI and MfeI restriction sites . To generate mScarlet \u2013 \u2206 EF1 - Swip1 , the \u2206 EF1 - Swip1 fragment was PCR amplified from pEGFP \u2013 \u2206 EF1 - Swip1 using the 5 \u2032 - agatctcgaGATGGCCACGGACGAGTTGGC - 3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 - cggtggatcCATCTTGAACGTGGACTGCAGCTCCTTAAAGG - 3 \u2032 primers , which added amino - and carboxy - terminal sites for the XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes , respectively ( indicated by lowercase letters ) . This fragment was then ligated into the mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 vector backbone after both had been digested with XhoI and BamHI .

DEST51 - mVenus was obtained from Addgene ( plasmid 154899 ) . Antibodies . The antibodies used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Generation of stable cell lines and SILAC cell culture treatment . To generate stable GFP \u2013 Rab21 - expressing mammalian cell lines , a Flp recombination target ( FRT ) - entry site was first introduced into MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells using the Flp - In technology ( Thermo Fisher ) . Briefly , MDA - MB - 231 cells were transfected with pFRT / lacZeo2 and stable clones were isolated using Zeocin as the selection marker ( 200 \u00b5 g ml \u2212 1 ) . The resulting MDA - MB - 231 - FRT cell line was then co - transfected with the pgLAP1 - Rab21 plasmid and pOG44 , and stable clones were selected in 500 \u00b5 g ml \u2212 1 hygromycin - containing medium and tested for GFP \u2013 Rab21 expression . Stable MDA - MB - 231 - GFP \u2013 Rab21 cell lines were cultivated in heavy ( Arg - 10 / Lys - 8 ) or light SILAC - DMEM medium plus hygromycin ( 200 \u00b5 g ml \u2212 1 ) for 12 d to ensure at least ten replication cycles for efficient labelling . Hygromycin supplementation was omitted for the last two days before the co - immunoprecipitation experiment . Screening for Rab21 interaction partners by GFP - pulldown . Each mass - spectrometry experiment consisted of a mixture of a GFP - pulldown in active GFP \u2013 Rab21 - expressing MDA - MB - 231 cells ( WT or active Rab21 Q76L mutant ) cultured in heavy medium and a GFP - pulldown in control cells ( expressing GFP or the inactive GFP \u2013 Rab21 T33N mutant ) cultured in light medium ( forward experiment ) . In the reverse experiment , the heavy and light media were exchanged ( label - swap experiment ) . Briefly , co - immunoprecipitation samples were prepared as follows . Cells ( two 15 cm dishes ) were cultured until they reached 60 \u2013 80 % confluence , washed with ice - cold PBSM ( PBS + 5 mM MgCl 2 ) , harvested in PBSM , pooled and washed again . The cell pellets were resuspended in 600 \u00b5 l lysis buffer LB ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM KCl , 1 . 3 % n - beta - octyl - d - glucopyranoside , 10 % glycerol , protease and phosphatase inhibitors , and 500 \u00b5 M GppNHp for GFP - active Rab21 - expressing cells or 500 \u00b5 M GDP for GFP - inactive Rab21 - expressing cells ) and lysed by douncing 40 \u00d7 in a tissue grinder ( dounce homogenizer ) and incubating on ice for 20 min . The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 18 , 000 g and the supernatant was incubated with 20 \u00b5 l GFP - Trap agarose beads ( Chromotek ) for 60 min at 4 \u00b0C by overhead rotation . The beads were then washed three times with 500 \u00b5 l washing buffer WB ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM KCl and 10 % glycerol ) , combining the heavy , GFP - active Rab21 immunoprecipitation with the light , GFP - inactive Rab21 immunoprecipitation ( forward experiment ) during the second wash step . Proteins were eluted from the beads in 100 \u00b5 l of U / T buffer ( 6 M urea + 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 ) for 15 min with shaking in a bacterial shaker at room temperature and an agitation rate of 1 , 400 r . p . m . The eluted proteins were collected and the process was repeated to maximize the protein yield . The eluted proteins were precipitated by adding 70 \u00b5 l of 2 . 5 M Na - acetate , pH 5 . 0 , 1 \u00b5 l GlycoBlue ( Thermo Fisher ) and 1 , 700 \u00b5 l ethanol to the pooled elution fractions ( 200 \u00b5 l ) in a 2 ml tube . After an overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C , the precipitation mixture was centrifuged for 50 min at 20 , 000 g and the resulting pellet was dried for 15 \u2013 20 min at 60 \u2013 70 \u00b0C . We followed standard procedures for in - solution protein digestion 51 . Briefly , the pellets were solubilized in U / T buffer , reduced with dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested by sequential addition of LysC ( Wako ) and Trypsin ( Promega ) overnight at room temperature . The peptides were desalted and stored on STAGE tips until analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass - spectrometry analysis . The samples were analysed using 240 min acetonitrile gradients on a 20 cm long reversed phase column with an inner diameter of 75 \u00b5 m , which was filled with 3 \u00b5 m C18 beads ( Dr . Maisch ) , using a Proxeon HPLC system ( Thermo Fisher ) coupled to the electrospray ion source of a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . The mass spectrometer was operated in the data - dependent mode with a full scan ( AGC target , 3 \u00d7 10 6 ; mass resolution ( R ) = 70 , 000 ) , followed by up to ten MS2 scans ( R = 17 , 500 ; maximal injection time , 60 ms ) and a dynamic exclusion for 30 s . Raw files were analysed using MaxQuant ( version 1 . 5 . 2 . 8 ) , using default parameters , and searched against a Uniprot human protein database ( 2014 \u2013 2010 ) . For visualization purposes , all of the identified proteins from each experiment were plotted ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1a \u2013 d ) , where each spot corresponds to a protein identified by mass spectrometry . Each plot is representative of two independent experiments ( forward and reverse , x and y axis ) , where every experiment consists of two independent immunoprecipitations . The mean log 2 - transformed fold - change values from both experiments were plotted against the absolute protein intensities ( intensity - based absolute quantification , iBAQ ) and significance B was calculated according to Cox and Mann 52 . The error function was estimated using the erfc as is implemented in the pracma package 53 ( R package version 2 . 2 . 9 ) . Abundance bins were defined by including 100 proteins in a subsequent order . The proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE 54 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD016478 . The log 10 - transformed ratios of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry are also available ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Immunoprecipitations , bimolecular complementation affinity purification and immunoblotting . MDA - MB - 231 and HEK293 cells expressing GFP - tagged or split Venus - tagged ( V1 or V2 ) proteins ( one 10 cm dish per condition ) were washed with cold PBS , harvested in PBS and pelleted . The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bc l IP - lysis buffer ( 40 mM HEPES \u2013 NaOH , 75 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) and incubated at + 4 \u00b0C for 30 min , followed by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 g for 10 min , + 4 \u00b0C ) . A fraction of the supernatant ( 20 \u03bc l ) was kept aside as the lysate control . The remainder of the supernatant was incubated with GFP - Trap beads ( ChromoTek , gtak - 20 ) , which bind to both GFP and complemented Venus ( V1 + V2 ) , for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C . Finally , the immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with wash NAtuRE CELL BIOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGy buffer ( 20 mM Tris \u2013 HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 % NP - 40 ) and denatured for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in reducing Laemmli buffer before SDS \u2013 PAGE analysis under denaturing conditions ( 4 \u2013 20 % Mini - PROTEAN TGX gels ) . The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) before blocking with blocking buffer ( Thermo , StartingBlock ( PBS ) blocking , 37538 ) and PBS ( 1 : 1 ratio ) . The membranes were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer . The membranes were then washed three times with TBST ( Tris - buffered saline with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) and incubated with fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies ( LI - COR ) , diluted 1 : 10 , 000 in blocking buffer , at room temperature for 1 h . The membranes were scanned using an infra - red imaging system ( Odyssey ; LI - COR Biosciences ) . Antibody immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins were performed on MDA - MB - 231 cell lysates ( one 10 cm dish per condition ) . The cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 200 \u03bc l IP - lysis buffer . SureBeads protein G magnetic beads ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , 161 - 4023 ) were thoroughly resuspended in their solution , and 100 \u03bc l ( 1 mg at 10 mg ml \u2212 1 ) were transferred to a 1 . 5 ml tube . The beads were then magnetized and the supernatant was discarded , after which the beads were washed three times with PBS - T ( 0 . 1 % Tween ) . Next , 2 \u03bc g of antibody or isotype - matching IgG control ( Supplementary Table 1 ) was added to the beads and kept at room temperature under rotation for 30 min , after which the beads were magnetized , the supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed three times with PBS - T . The cell lysate was then added to the beads and rotated for 1 h at room temperature . A fraction of the total lysate ( 25 \u03bc l ) was set aside for use as a total lysate control . The beads were then magnetized , the supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed three times with TBST , after which the samples were centrifuged at 600 g for several seconds . The beads were then magnetized and the residual buffer was aspirated off , followed by the addition of sample buffer , boiling ( 10 min at 95 \u00b0C ) and separation using SDS \u2013 PAGE . Protein transfer and detection were performed as described earlier . Protein purification . For the production of recombinant GST - tagged proteins ( Rab21 16 - 225 , Swip1 and GGA3 ) , pGEX - 4T1 \u2013 Rab21 16 - 225 , pGEX - 4T1 \u2013 Swip1 or pGEX6P1 \u2013 GGA3 - BL21 Escherichia coli Rosetta transformed cells were cultured and induced with 250 \u00b5 M isopropyl - \u03b2 - d - thiogalactoside at an optical density at 600 nm of 0 . 5 \u2013 0 . 8 at 22 \u00b0C in LB media overnight . The cells were then lysed and resuspended in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT . The desired GST - tagged protein was purified from this suspension using a gravity GST - column . In the case of GST \u2013 Rab21 , elution of the protein was followed by thrombin - cleavage and gel filtration in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT buffer using a Superdex S75 16 / 60 column attached to a GST - column to bind the cleaved GST . Fractions containing the monomeric proteins were pooled , concentrated via ultrafiltration ( Amicon Ultra , 15 ml , 10 , 000 MWCO ) and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen for long - term storage at \u2212 80 \u00b0C . For the production of His - fusion proteins ( IRSp53 , VASP and ARF1 ) , E . coli BL21 Rosetta ( DE3 ) cells picked from individual colonies were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium ( containing ampicillin at 50 \u03bc g ml \u2212 1 ) and cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C . Between 10 and 100 ml of the overnight culture was diluted in 1 l of LB and cultured in a bacterial shaker at an agitation rate of 240 r . p . m . at 37 \u00b0C until it reached an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0 . 4 \u2013 0 . 6 . Isopropyl - \u03b2 - d - thiogalactoside ( 1 mM ) was then added , the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 , 000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C after the induction and the pellets were used immediately or conserved at \u2212 80 \u00b0C after washing in PBS . The bacterial pellets were resuspended in His - lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1 mM \u03b2 - mercaptoethanol , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and 10 % glycerol ) ; the samples were sonicated three times ( 30 s each ) on ice and pelleted by centrifugation at 30 , 778 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C using a JA 20 Beckman rotor or at 100 , 000 g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C using a 55 . 2 Ti Beckman rotor . A total of 600 \u03bc l of NiNTA beads ( Qiagen ) , which had been washed three times with His - lysis buffer , was added to the supernatant and the samples were incubated 1 \u2013 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with rocking . The beads were then washed twice in 20 mM imidazole , 600 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 mM \u03b2 - mercaptoethanol and 10 % glycerol and once in 40 mM imidazole , 300 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 mM \u03b2 - mercaptoethanol and 10 % glycerol ( 5 min , 4 \u00b0C ) . The beads were packed in Poly - Prep chromatography columns ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) and eluted with 200 mM imidazole , 50 mM Tris pH 8 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM \u03b2 - mercaptoethanol and 10 % glycerol ( 500 \u03bc l fractions ) . The fractions , evaluated by Bradford assay and SDS \u2013 PAGE , were pooled and dialysed . The samples were aliquoted , flash - frozen and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 10 % glycerol . Nucleotide loading and GST - pulldowns . To load Rab21 with either a non - hydrolysable form of GTP ( GppNHp ) or GDP , 200 \u00b5 M of recombinant Rab21 or GST \u2013 Rab21 were incubated with 10 mM EDTA and a 25 \u00d7 excess of the nucleotide ( 5 mM GppNHp or GDP ) in exchange buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT ) for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C . The EDTA - based exchange reaction was then stopped by the addition of 40 mM MgCl 2 and incubation for 15 min on ice . The buffer was exchanged with measuring buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT ) to reach the desired protein concentration using 10 kDa ultrafiltration devices ( Amicon ) . Equal amounts of nucleotide and protein were added to ensure complete loading of Rab21 with the desired nucleotide . GST - pulldowns using purified GST fusion proteins and recombinant Rab21 bound to GppNHp , GDP or no nucleotide ( in the presence of EDTA ) were performed as follows . GST \u2013 Swip1 or GST \u2013 Appl1 ( 50 \u00b5 g ) were incubated with 200 \u00b5 g of recombinant Rab21 for 30 min before incubation with Glutathione Sepharose beads for an additional 30 min . The bead - bound proteins were divided in two fractions and separated by SDS \u2013 PAGE , followed by either Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with anti - Rab21 . The pulldowns were performed three times . Overlay assay . Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in TBST 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 buffer and allowed to dry . Equal or increasing amounts of recombinant purified proteins were spotted on the membranes and allowed to dry . The membranes , previously blocked in TBST 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 with 5 % milk , were then incubated with the recombinant protein of interest , resuspended in TBST 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 with 5 % milk , for 1 \u2013 2 h at 4 \u00b0C . After extensive washing in TBST 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , the membranes were subjected to western blot analysis with the desired antibodies . In vitro binding of GST \u2013 Swip1 to Arf1 T31N or Arf1 Q71L . Cell lysates from HEL293T cells transfected with HA - tagged Arf1 T31N or Arf1 Q71L ( lysis buffer : 50 mM Tris \u2013 HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail ) were incubated with equal amounts ( 2 \u03bc M ) of GST \u2013 Swip1 or GST , as the control , for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C . The reactions were washed three times in lysis buffer . After washing , the beads were resuspended in 2 \u00d7 SDS \u2013 PAGE sample buffer ( 1 : 1 vol / vol ) , boiled for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C , centrifuged for 1 min and then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels . SIM microscopy and co - localization analysis . Cells growing on uncoated glass or collagen I - coated dishes were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , blocked with 10 % horse serum and incubated with antibodies to the indicated endogenous proteins . This was followed by incubation with fluorophore - labelled secondary antibodies ( AF568 - , AF488 - or AF647 - labelled anti - mouse or anti - rabbit ; Life Technologies ) . For visualization of Swip1 - containing invaginations , cells expressing mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min before fixation . The cells were imaged using an OMX DeltaVision system and spot co - localization analysis was performed in Z stacks of the cells using the plugin ComDet in ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . net / Spots _ colocalization _ comdet ) , which allowed for improved detection of the invaginations as it ignores non - homogeneous cytoplasmic background . Using this plugin , we pinpointed the mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 spots ( pixel size , > 5 ) and analysed co - localization , based on proximity ( pixel distance , 4 ) , with spots from the second channel stained for the protein of interest . Next , the ratio of co - localization with mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 was calculated as a percentage of co - localized spots per cell . At least 30 cells per condition were imaged and analysed . The co - localization plots show the mean \u00b1 95 % CI . Statistical significance compared with the control condition was calculated . Representative rendered images of the invaginations ( x \u2013 z plane ) were visualized using the IMARIS software ( Oxford Instruments , version 8 . 1 . 2 ) . PLA . MDA - MB - 231 cells growing on coverslips were fixed , washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature . The cells were stained using anti - Swip1 ( 1 : 100 ) and anti - Rab21 ( 1 : 50 ) primary antibodies diluted in 5 % horse serum for 1 h at room temperature . Proximity ligation was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( Duolink in situ PLA , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Interactions between Swip1 and Rab21 in cells were detected using confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP5 , \u00d7 63 / 1 . 4 Apo oil objective ) and the number of PLA spots per 1 , 000 \u00b5 m 3 was determined using the IMARIS software . For the PLA between active \u03b2 1 - integrin ( 12G10 ) and IRSp53 , MDA - MB - 231 cells growing on glass - bottomed dishes ( and for Fig . 4i , MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing GFP or GFP \u2013 Swip1 ) were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min before fixation , after which they were washed and permeabilized as described above . The cells were stained using 12G10 ( 1 : 100 ) and anti - IRSp53 ( 1 : 300 ) primary antibodies diluted in 5 % horse serum for 1 h at room temperature . The PLA was performed as described above and imaged using a 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , 3i Inc ) Marianas spinning disk confocal microscope with a Yokogawa CSU \u2010 W1 scanner and a back - illuminated 10 MHz EMCDD camera ( Photometrics Evolve ) with a \u00d7 63 / 1 . 4 oil objective , controlled by the Slidebook ( version 6 ) software . BiFC and TIRF microscopy . MDA - MB - 231 cells growing in glass - bottomed dishes were co - transfected with split Venus constructs ( pDEST - V1 \u2013 Rab21 and pDEST - Swip1 \u2013 V2 ) and imaged 30 h after transfection . Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision OMX v4 system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) fitted with an Olympus APO N \u00d7 60 oil TIRF objective lens , 1 . 49 numerical aperture ( NA ) , used in TIRF illumination mode . The emitted light was collected on a front - illuminated pco . edge sCMOS ( pixel size , 6 . 5 mm ; readout speed , 95 MHz ; PCO AG ) controlled by SoftWorx . The TIRF angle for all channels was maintained at 83 . 5\u00b0 . Images were taken every 500 ms for 2 min at 37 \u00b0C in presence of 5 % CO 2 . Imaging of NAtuRE CELL BIOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGy the above - mentioned BiFC constructs together with different endocytic vesicle markers was performed using a 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , 3i Inc ) Marianas spinning disk confocal microscope with a Yokogawa CSU \u2010 W1 scanner and a back - illuminated 10 MHz EMCDD camera ( Photometrics Evolve ) using a \u00d7 63 / 1 . 4 oil objective . The cells were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , blocked with 10 % horse serum and incubated with antibodies to the indicated endogenous proteins . This was followed by incubation with fluorophore - labelled secondary antibodies ( AF568 - , AF488 - or AF647 - labelled anti - mouse , anti - rabbit or anti - goat ; Life Technologies ) . DNA - PAINT . For two - colour single - molecule localization microscopy ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) , we used DNA - PAINT 24 . Cells overexpressing GFP \u2013 Swip1 and HA \u2013 Arf1 were fixed and labelled using primary antibodies to GFP ( Abcam , ab1218 ) and HA - tag ( Cell Signaling , 3724 ) , respectively . The cells were then stained with the appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to PAINT DNA handles ( Ultivue ) . Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision OMX v4 system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) fitted with an Olympus APO N \u00d7 60 oil TIRF objective lens , 1 . 49 NA , used in TIRF illumination mode . Emitted light was collected on a front - illuminated pco . edge sCMOS ( pixel size , 6 . 5 mm ; readout speed , 95 MHz ; PCO AG ) controlled by SoftWorx . First , a TIRF image of GFP \u2013 Swip1 was acquired , followed by the DNA - PAINT acquisitions . DNA - PAINT imaging was done sequentially , first for GFP \u2013 Swip1 ( 10 , 000 frames , 50 ms ) and then Arf1 ( 10 , 000 frames , 100 ms ) in PAINT buffer ( 10 mM Tris \u2013 HCl , 100 mM NaCl and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , pH 7 . 5 ) supplemented with 0 . 5 nM of the corresponding PAINT imager strands coupled to AF647 ( GFP \u2013 Swip1 ) or AF568 ( Arf1 ) . For both conditions , full laser power was used and the beam concentrator was enabled . No cross - talk between the channels was observed . The ThunderSTORM 55 ImageJ plugin 56 , with the Phasor - based localization two - dimensional method 57 , was used for the localization of single fluorophores . After filtering out localizations to reject photon counts that were too low , the translational shifts were corrected by autocorrelation . Image reconstructions were performed using the ThunderSTORM ImageJ plugin . Endocytosis assays . MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 468 and BT - 20 cells were cultured on uncoated plastic dishes or glass coverslips , unless otherwise stated . For integrin endocytosis assays , surface integrins were labelled with an antibody that recognizes the active conformation of \u03b2 1 - integrins ( 12G10 ) at 4 \u00b0C , followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min , unless otherwise stated . The antibody remaining on the surface was washed away with acid ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 2 . 5 ) . The cells were subsequently fixed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % saponin and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody to visualize and quantify the amount of internalized integrins . Several fields were randomly imaged with identical microscope settings using a 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , 3i Inc ) Marianas spinning disk confocal microscope with a Yokogawa CSU \u2010 W1 scanner and a back - illuminated 10 MHz EMCDD camera ( Photometrics Evolve ) using a \u00d7 63 / 1 . 4 oil objective . Quantification of the endocytosed integrins was performed on three - dimensional projections of the cells using the IMARIS software with the \u2018spots detection\u2019 function . The sum of the intensities of all of the vesicles in a cell was divided by the volume of that cell . All of the intensity values were then normalized to the average of all cells in the control condition ( siCTRL ) . A similar procedure was followed for the uptake of MHCI ( Sigma , SAB4700637 ) and 9EG7 ( active \u03b2 1 - integrin ) . For the AF568 - labelled transferrin ( Thermo Fisher , T23365 ) and 10 kDa dextran \u2013 TMR uptake experiments , MDA - MB - 231 cells were treated with 1 mg ml \u2212 1 of transferrin , 10 kDa dextran \u2013 TMR ( Invitrogen , D1816 ) or 10 kDa amino dextran ( Molecular Probes ) conjugated to FITC during the 15 min incubation at 37 \u00b0C . For the double - uptake experiments , the cells were previously labelled with 12G10 \u2013 AF488 antibody ( Abcam , ab202641 ) at 4 \u00b0C as described above . After the internalization step at 37 \u00b0C , the remaining fluorescently labelled molecules at the cell surface were removed with an acid wash , followed by fixation , labelling of the plasma membrane with WGA lectin and imaging as described above . Surface biotinylation - based integrin trafficking assays were performed based on previously published methods 58 , 59 , with some modifications . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) plates were prepared by coating Nunc MaxiSorb 96 - well plates ( Thermo Fischer , 44 - 2404 - 21 ) with 5 \u03bc g ml \u2212 1 anti - integrin in TBS ( 50 \u03bc l per well ) overnight at + 4 \u00b0C ( see Supplementary Table 1 for the antibody details ) . The wells were blocked with 5 % BSA in TBS for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C . MDA - MB - 231 cells , silenced three days before the experiment , as described earlier , were cultured in 10 % FCS - containing medium on 6 cm dishes to 80 % confluency . The cells were placed on ice and washed once with cold PBS . Cell surface proteins were labelled with 0 . 13 mg ml \u2212 1 EZ - link cleavable sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin ( Thermo Scientific , 21331 ) in serum - free DMEM medium for 30 min at + 4 \u00b0C . The unbound biotin was washed away with cold medium and the cells were incubated for 15 min on ice in cold serum - free DMEM with or without 100 \u03bc M primaquine ( Sigma , 160393 ) . Pre - warmed serum - free DMEM ( with or without primaquine ) was added to the cells . The biotin - labelled surface proteins were allowed to internalize at + 37 \u00b0C for the indicated time periods , after which the cells were quickly placed back on ice and rinsed with cold DMEM and cold cell surface reduction buffer ( 50 mm Tris \u2013 HCl , pH 8 . 6 and 100 mm NaCl ) . The remaining biotin at the cell surface after internalization was removed with 30 mg ml \u2212 1 MesNa ( sodium 2 - mercaptoethanesulfonate ; Fluka , 63705 ) in MesNa buffer for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C , followed by quenching with 100 mM iodoacetamide ( Sigma ) for 15 min on ice . To determine the total amount of surface biotinylation , one of the cell dishes was left on ice after biotin labelling , followed by treatment without reducing MesNa . For the 0 min internalization , cells were maintained on ice in serum - free DMEM until cell surface reduction with MesNA . The cells were lysed by scraping in lysis buffer ( 1 . 5 % octylglucoside , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % BSA , 1 mM EDTA , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) and incubation at + 4 \u00b0C for 20 min . The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation ( 16 , 000 g , 10 min , 4 \u00b0C ) . To calculate the amount of internalized , biotinylated integrins , 50 \u03bc l volumes of the cell lysates were incubated in duplicate wells at + 4 \u00b0C overnight , washed extensively with TBST , incubated for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with 1 : 1 , 000 horseradish peroxidase - coupled streptavidin ( Fisher , 21130 ) , washed and detected with antibody for ELISA detection . For the FACS - based EGFR endocytosis assay , adherent cells were labelled with 1 : 500 extracellular domain - binding EGFR antibody ( UpState , 05 - 101 ) on ice for 30 min . The unbound antibody was washed away and the cells were chased in warm medium in the presence or absence of 10 ng ml \u2212 1 EGF . The cells were washed with cold PBS and carefully collected by scraping . Next , the cells were fixed for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C with 4 % paraformaldehyde , washed and resuspended in PBS , followed by incubation with AF647 - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody for 30 min ( 1 : 300 dilution in PBS ; Invitrogen ) , washed with PBS and analysed using a LSRFortessa ( BD Biosciences ) . Data analysis was performed using the Flowing software ( version 2 ; Cell Imaging Core of the Turku Bioscience Centre ) . The geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity from cells labelled with secondary antibody alone was used as the background and subtracted from the stained samples . For normalization , the background - corrected values were divided by the sum of all signals from one independent experiment . Representative raw flow cytometry data can be found in Supplementary Fig . 1 . Hypo - isotonic shock . MDA - MB - 231 cells were transfected with siCTRL , or siRNA1 or siRNA2 against Swip1 and used 96 h after silencing . The cells were maintained in either isotonic ( 100 % incomplete DMEM medium ) or hypotonic ( 50 % incomplete DMEM and 50 % sterile double distilled water ) medium for 1 min , followed by pulse of various cargos in isotonic media for 1 min . The pulse contained the following cargos : anti - \u03b2 1 - integrin ( 12G10 conjugated to AF488 ; 2 \u03bc g ml \u2212 1 ) , 1 mg ml \u2212 1 10 kDa dextran conjugated to tetra methyl rhodamine and 10 \u03bc g ml \u2212 1 transferrin conjugated to AF647 . After the pulse , the surface - bound cargoes were stripped with 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 2 . 5 for 3 min on ice and then fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde . The cells were then imaged using confocal microscopy as described earlier and the cell mean intensity of each cargo was quantified using manual segmentation with ImageJ . Electron microscopy and APEX labelling . APEX labelling of GFP \u2013 Swip1 for electron microscopy was performed as previously described 35 . Briefly , mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with GFP \u2013 Swip1 and GBP - APEX ( Addgene , plasmid 67651 ) constructs using a Neon transfection system ( as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions ) and plated into 35 mm tissue culture dishes . After 24 h , the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min , fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , and washed three times in cacodylate buffer and once in 1 mg ml \u2212 1 3 , 3 \u2032 - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; Sigma - Aldrich ) solution in cacodylate for 5 min . The cells were then subjected to the DAB reaction in the presence of H 2 O 2 for 30 min and stained with 1 % osmium tetroxide for 2 min . The cells were processed in situ with serial dehydration in increasing percentages of ethanol , followed by serial infiltration with LX112 resin in a Pelco Biowave microwave before overnight polymerization at 60 \u00b0C . Ultra - thin ( 60 nm ) sections were cut on a Leica UC6 microtome parallel to the culture dish and micrographs were acquired using a Jeol 1011 transmission electron microscope . Vesicle tracking . For Rab21 - vesicle tracking , MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP \u2013 Rab21 were transfected with one of two different siRNA sequences to deplete Swip1 . In the rescue experiment ( Fig . 6i ) , control - and Swip1 - silenced cells were transfected with GFP \u2013 Rab21 and either mScarlet - I \u2013 Swip1 or mScarlet - I \u2013 \u2206 EF1 - Swip1 . The movement of the Rab21 vesicles was followed for 2 min using TIRF microscopy ( Visitron SD - TIRF Nikon Eclipse TiE with a \u00d7 60 Olympus TIRF oil objective , 1 . 49 NA , or DeltaVision OMX v4 as described in the \u2018BiFC and TIRF microscopy\u2019 section ) . For each cell , GFP \u2013 Rab21 vesicles were imaged every 500 ms , for 2 min . The TIRF angle was kept constant at 85 . 5\u00b0 . The vesicles were detected and tracked using the \u2018spots tracking\u2019 function in the IMARIS software . The parameters used in the algorithm were an estimated diameter of spots / vesicles of 0 . 5 \u00b5 m , background subtraction and Brownian motion for modelling the vesicle movement , with a maximum distance of 20 \u00b5 m for the displacement length and a maximum gap size of 3 \u00b5 m between spots . We used the mean speed of all vesicle tracks in one cell to then calculate the average speed of the vesicles for each cell . At least ten cells per condition were analysed and data from three independent experiments were quantified . Focal adhesion analysis . Cells were plated on dishes coated with the indicated ECM component ( collagen I , laminin - 1 or fibronectin ) , fixed and immunostained NAtuRE CELL BIOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGy with an antibody that recognizes the focal adhesion - component vinculin , present in mature adhesions . At least six cells per condition per experiment were imaged and analysed ( 18 cells per condition in total from three independent experiments ) . Vinculin - positive focal adhesions were detected from an image mask created using the ImageJ software following background subtraction and setting of a median Gaussian filter ( 3 . 0 ) . The number of focal adhesions ( detected particles ) and the total cell area occupied by focal adhesions in each cell were quantified from the image mask . Adhesion dynamics . For the adhesion dynamics studies , MDA - MB - 231 cells transiently expressing GFP \u2013 paxillin were transfected with one of two different siRNA sequences to deplete Swip1 . GFP \u2013 paxillin was imaged for 120 min at the TIRF plane using a Deltavision OMX system and a \u00d7 63 objective . The cells were imaged every 1 min , at 37 \u00b0C in presence of 5 % CO 2 , using multi - position capabilities . The focal adhesion dynamics were then analysed using the Focal Adhesion Analysis Server 60 . Only focal adhesions with a minimum lifetime of ten frames were analysed , and the focal adhesions that were assembled and disassembled during the course of imaging were used to measure the focal adhesion kinetics . Focal adhesion proximity analysis . MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing V1 \u2013 Rab21 , V2 \u2013 Swip1 and mKate2 \u2013 paxillin were imaged live using a TIRF microscope . Following acquisition , images were denoised using Noise2Void 61 trained using the ZeroCostDL4Mic platform ( version 1 . 11 . 1 ) 62 . To denoise the Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 movies , individual Noise2Void models were generated for each movie using 300 epochs , 12 , 288 image patches , a batch size of 128 and a starting learning rate of 0 . 0004 .

After denoising , individual focal adhesions were automatically segmented using the focal adhesion server 60 , while individual Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 puncta were semi - automatically segmented using the Trainable Weka Segmentation tool implemented in Fiji 63 . The nearest distance between Swip1 \u2013 Rab21 puncta and a paxillin - positive focal adhesion was measured using the Distance Analysis ( DiAna ) Fiji plugin 64 . Images containing randomly distributed puncta in the cells ( to assess their distance to the focal adhesion ) were generated using a custom Fiji macro ( available as a Zenodo package as described in the \u2018Random cell migration\u2019 section ) 65 . Random cell migration . Cells were seeded in 24 - well plates ( Greiner Bio - One ) one day before imaging . The medium was supplemented with 500 nM SiR - DNA ( Cytoskeleton Inc ) 2 h before imaging . The cells were then imaged live ( 37 \u00b0C , 5 % CO 2 ) using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 - E microscope equipped with a sCMOS Orca Flash4 . 0 camera ( Hamamatsu ) and controlled by the NIS - Elements software ( Nikon , version 5 . 11 . 01 ) . The cells were imaged using a \u00d7 20 Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda objective ( 0 . 75 NA ) \u2014one frame every 10 min for 16 h . The cell nuclei were automatically segmented over time using the deep learning algorithm StarDist implemented in the ZeroCostDL4Mic platform and tracked using TrackMate 62 , 66 \u2013 68 . A custom StarDist model was generated using the ZeroCostDL4Mic platform 62 . This custom StarDist model was trained for 300 epochs using 46 manually annotated paired images ( image dimensions : 1 , 024 \u00d7 1 , 024 ) with a batch size of two , an augmentation factor of four and a mean absolute error loss function . The StarDist \u2018Versatile fluorescent nuclei\u2019 model was used as a training starting point . Key Python packages used include TensorFlow ( version 0 . 1 . 12 ) , Keras ( version 2 . 3 . 1 ) , CSBdeep ( version 0 . 6 . 1 ) , NumPy ( version 1 . 19 . 5 ) and Cuda ( version 11 . 0 . 221 ) . The training was accelerated using a Tesla P100GPU . Tracking was performed using a TrackMate script available at https : / / github . com / HenriquesLab / ZeroCostDL4Mic / tree / master / Tools / Automated _ tracking with the following settings : linking maximum distance = 150 pixels , gap closing distance = 20 pixels and maximum frame gap = 1 . Cell tracks were combined in R using the script available at https : / / github . com / HenriquesLab / ZeroCostDL4Mic / tree / master / Tools / Automated _ tracking and further analysed using the Motility Lab website ( http : / / www . motilitylab . net / ) . The associated data used for analysis are available as Zenodo packages\u2014that is , the training dataset , StarDist model used for the automated tracking 69 and archive source code used in the analyses 65 . Plots to visualize cell track speed and mean displacement were made using plotsofdata ( 1 . 05 ) 70 . Scratch - wound migration assay . After siRNA transfection , MDA - MB - 231 cells were seeded into ibidi two - well culture inserts placed in ibidi \u00b5 - dishes and cultured to become confluency . Before imaging , the culture inserts were carefully removed with forceps and the cells were washed twice with PBS . Next , warm medium was added to the cells and live imaging was started immediately afterwards ( 37 \u00b0C , 5 % CO 2 ) . The cells were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 - E microscope with a \u00d7 10 objective for 24 h with a 20 min imaging interval . Data were quantified using Fiji ( ImageJ ) by measuring the area of the closing gap between the cells at 0 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 and 18 h . Invasion assay . PureCol EZ gel ( 200 \u00b5 l ; Advanced Biomatrix , 5074 ) was allowed to polymerize in 8 \u00b5 m inserts ( Greiner Bio - One , 662638 ) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C . The inserts were then inverted and 100 \u00b5 l of cell suspension ( 50 , 000 cells ) was seeded onto the outer face of the insert . The cells were allowed to adhere at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h . The inserts were then dipped sequentially into PBS and placed in serum - free medium . Medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and 20 ng ml \u2212 1 EGF was placed on top of the matrix and the cells were allowed to invade the matrix for 72 h . The cells were then fixed using 4 % paraformaldehyde for 2 h , permeabilized in 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h at room temperature and stained overnight at 4 \u00b0C using AP488 phalloidin . Invading cells were imaged using a confocal microscope ( LSM880 ; Zeiss ) . Invasion was quantified using the area calculator plugin in ImageJ , measuring the fluorescence intensity of cells invading 60 \u03bc m or more and expressing this as a percentage of the fluorescence intensity of all cells within the matrix . Breast cancer tissue microarrays . The study was approved by the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and Turku University Hospital ( decision T012 / 015 / 19 ) and the use of tissue samples was approved by the Scientific Steering Group of Auria Biobank ( decision AB19 - 4522 ) . The study population consisted of 243 patients with breast cancer who were diagnosed and treated in Turku University Hospital between 1998 and 2013 . Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants . All patients were treated with surgical resection or mastectomy and the archived formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tumour samples were used to form tissue microarrays that were prepared similarly as previously described 71 . Briefly , the tissue microarrays were prepared by punching a representative site of paraffin block of each tumour with a cylinder with a diameter of either 1 mm or 1 . 5 mm and using an automated tissue arrayer ( TMA Grand Master , 3DHISTECH Ltd ) . The cohort consisted of 149 patients with triple - negative and 89 patients with HER2 + breast cancer diagnosed using the WHO classification criteria of tumours of the breast at the time of sampling . In addition , four patients with hormone receptor - positive and one with non - neoplastic breast cancer were included in the tissue microarrays . The cores were available from 225 tumour centres , 121 tumour borders , 26 lymph node metastases and 127 tumour areas with inflammatory infiltrate . All relevant medical records of the patients were reviewed and information on tumour size , histological grade , hormone - receptor status , Her2 oncogene , proliferation marker Ki67 and axillary lymph node status were gathered . The follow - up time was until 31 March 2020 and the range of follow - up varied from 1 month to 22 years 3 months ( mean , 10 years 2 months ) . Immunohistochemistry . Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays comprising one or two tissue cores from each tumour site of each patient . The tissue samples were cut into 4 \u00b5 m sections , deparaffinized and rehydrated using standard procedures . Heat - mediated antigen retrieval was done for all samples in citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) in a pressure cooker ( Decloaking chamber , Biocare Medical NxGen ) for 20 min . The sections were stained in a semi - automatic Labvision autostainer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , where they were washed with washing buffer ( 0 . 05 M Tris \u2013 HCl pH 7 . 6 and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) and the endogenous enzymes were blocked with 3 % H 2 O 2 Tris \u2013 HCl for 10 min . This was followed by a blocking step using Normal antibody diluent ( Immunologic , BD09 - 125 ) , incubation with the primary antibody ( anti - Swip1 , diluted 1 : 200 ; Atlas Antibodies ) for 1 h , followed by washes and incubation with the secondary antibody ( goat anti - rabbit HRP ; Immunologic , DPVB110HRP ) for 30 min . The samples were then washed and incubated with the DAB solution ( Bright DAB , Immunologic BS04 - 110 ) for 10 min . After counterstaining with Mayer\u2019s HTX , the slides were dehydrated , cleared in xylene and mounted with Pertex . The antibody specificity was validated on agarose - embedded cell pellets post siRNA transfection ( siCTRL , Swip1 siRNA1 or Swip1 siRNA2 ; Extended Data Fig . 10b ) . For each tumour sample , the percentage of cells with immuno - positive signal ( 0 \u2013 100 % ) in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane were scored . Samples with more than 80 % of the cells exhibiting positive staining were considered to have high Swip1 levels , samples with less than 30 % of cells staining positive were considered to have low Swip1 levels and the samples in - between were considered to have medium Swip1 levels . Statistical analysis of clinical samples . The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 26 ( IBM Corp . ) . Two - tailed P values below 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . The clinical parameters ( age , tumour size and Ki67 ) across Swip1 categories ( < 100 and 100 , or < 80 and \u2265 80 ) were evaluated using independent - samples double - sided Mann \u2013 Whitney U tests . The categorical parameters ( grade and lymph node metastasis status ) were compared with \u03c7 2 or Fisher\u2019s exact tests across the Swip1 categories . A related - samples Wilcoxon signed - rank test was used for paired comparisons of tumour centres and other core types . Patients with missing data were censored from the paired comparisons . Overall survival was compared between low and high percentage of immuno - positive cells in the tumour centre samples of patients with TNBC and Her2 + using Kaplan \u2013 Meier plots and log - rank tests ; the samples were divided into the following groups : < 100 % or 100 % for the cytoplasmic signal and < 80 % or \u2265 80 % for the membranal Swip1 signal . Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the hazard ratio of tumour centres with high versus low Swip1 immuno - positivity . In the case of non - proportional hazards , the weighted estimation of Cox regression was used 72 . The adjusted Cox analysis was performed relative to the clinical prognostic features . The analysis was performed using the R Software for Statistical Computing ( version 3 . 6 . 2 ; www . r - project . org ) , and the survival ( version 3 . 1 . 8 ) and NAtuRE CELL BIOLOGy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGy coxphw ( version 4 . 0 . 2 ) packages . Survival differences were quantified as hazard ratios with a 95 % CI . For the analysis of Swip1 mRNA expression , the breast cancer cohort used was described previously 73 \u2013 75 ; the \u03c7 2 test was used for the statistical analyses . Statistics and reproducibility . Experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility . Experiments from Figs . 2a , e , 3a \u2013 c , f , g , 6b , d and Extended Data Figs . 1e , 2b , 4a , 5e , 6d were performed twice . All attempts at replication were successful . Key experiments were reproduced by different co - authors in different laboratories around the world . No statistical method was used to pre - determine the sample size . The standard in the field , a minimum of three , was selected for most experiments . No data were excluded from the analyses . For immunofluorescence analysis , randomization was ensured by taking representative pictures of different fields ( or individual cells ) from the same sample at different locations in the sample . The pathologist performed blinded scoring of the immunosignal in the tissue samples . After scoring , the Biobank scientist correlated the scored values with the patient identifier and the corresponding clinical information . The two - sided Significance B test was used to identify relevant interactors of Rab21 from the proteomics dataset . No multiple hypothesis correction method was applied due to the small number of selected proteins for the statistical analysis . Abundance bins were defined by including 1 , 000 proteins in a subsequent order . The GraphPad Prism software and two - tailed Student\u2019s t - test ( paired or unpaired , as appropriate ) was used for statistical analysis of in vitro experiments . When the data were not normally distributed , a two - sided Mann \u2013 Whitney test was used . For the ELISA - based trafficking assay and the scratch - wound migration assay , statistical significance was determined using multiple - comparison t - tests for paired data , with the post - hoc Holm \u2013 Sidak method , with \u03b1 = 5 . 000 % . Each row was analysed individually , without assuming a consistent s . d . For the FACS analyses of cell - surface \u03b2 1 - integrin , the statistical significance was determined using two - tailed Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank tests . Reporting Summary .

GFP ( c ) or GFP - WT - Rab21 vs . GFP - CA - Rab21 ( d ) . ( a - d ) Each spot in the plots corresponds to one identified protein by mass spectrometry . Plots are representative of 2 independent experiments , forward and reverse ; where every experiment consists of two independent affinity purifications . Plots show mean fold - changes from forward and reverse experiments against absolute protein abundances ( intensity - based absolute quantification , iBAQ ) . Abundance bins were defined by including 1000 proteins in a subsequent order . Log10 fold change of proteins were tested for significance using double - sided significance B tests . No multiple hypothesis correction method was applied , due to the small number of selected proteins for the statistical analysis . Proteins with a P - value < 0 . 01 are projected as a triangle , while non - significant proteins are shown as circles . P - values are depicted in the figure for a selected set of proteins relevant to the work . Proteins in red are markedly enriched in the CA - or WT - Rab21 fraction and proteins in blue are known endosomal proteins clathrin ( CLTA , CLTB , CLTC ) , AP2 ( AP2A1 , AP2B1 , AP2M1 , AP2S1 ) , caveolin ( CAV1 ) and dynamin II ( DNM2 ) , which are not specifically enriched . Swip1 was strongly enriched in the GFP - WT - Rab21 vs . GFP \u2013 DN - Rab21 ( a ) and GFP - CA - Rab21 and GFP - WT - Rab21 fractions compared to GFP fractions ( b , d ) , and it was equally enriched in the GFP - CA - Rab21 compared to the GFP - WT - Rab21 fraction ( c ) . Clathrin ( CLTA , CLTB , CLTC ) , AP2 ( AP2A1 , AP2B1 , AP2M1 , AP2S1 ) , caveolin ( CAV1 ) and dynamin II ( DNM2 ) are not strongly enriched in any fraction . ( e ) .

The roles of actin in CME are poorly understood due to inadequate knowledge of actin organization at clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) . Using platinum replica electron microscopy of mammalian cells , we show that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent branched actin networks , which often emerge from microtubule tips , assemble along the CCS perimeter , lack interaction with the apical clathrin lattice , and have barbed ends oriented toward the CCS . This structure is hardly compatible with the widely held \u201c apical pulling \u201d model describing actin functions in CME . Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition or epsin knockout produce large \ufb02 at non - dynamic CCSs , which split into invaginating subdomains upon recovery from Arp2 / 3 inhibi - tion . Moreover , epsin localization to CCSs depends on Arp2 / 3 activity . We propose an \u201c edge pushing \u201d model for CME , wherein branched actin poly - merization promotes severing and invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs in an epsin - dependent manner by pushing at the CCS boundary , thus releasing forces opposing the intrinsic curvature of clathrin lattices . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the major endocytic pathway in cells , which is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes 1 , 2 . The formation of an endocytic vesicle during CME involves local membrane invagination to form a small bud followed by constriction of the bud neck and vesicle scission and departure . All these events are energetically unfavorable , but the relevant sources of energy are not fully understood . Clathrin self - assembly is an important but often not suf \ufb01 cient force - generating mechanism for membrane invagination during CME . Energy input from actin polymerization is necessary for CME in yeast , and important in mammalian cells 2 \u2013 5 , especially when high membrane tension resists invagination 6 \u2013 8 . In mammalian cells , actin is thought to function only at the late CME stages 7 , 9 \u2013 11 , whereas in budding yeast actin polymerization was found to promote the initial invagination of \ufb02 atclathrin - coatedstructures ( CCSs ) 12 . BesidesCME , large \ufb02 atclathrin - coated plaques serve as unconventional cell - matrix adhesions and mechanosensitive signaling platforms 6 , 13 . The turnover of these pla - ques requires actin dynamics 14 , but the underlying mechanism is unclear . Actin \ufb01 laments function in CME in the form ofbranched networks generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 15 \u2013 18 . In general , branched actin net - works produce pushing force by elongating multiple barbed ends against the load 19 . Accordingly , at a structural level actin \ufb01 lament barbed ends are oriented toward the target \u2013 the plasma membrane in lamellipodia 20 , 21 or a moving particle in comet tails 22 . Using platinum replica electron microscopy ( PREM ) , we have found that barbed ends are also oriented toward invaginating CCSs in B16F1 melanoma cells 18 . Importantly , these branched actin networks were located at the CCS perimeter without associating with the apical CCS surface . Based on these \ufb01 nding , we proposed that barbed ends promote bud elongation , neck constriction and vesicle departure after scission by pushing onto the edge of the clathrin coat without forming any strong interactions Received : 20 July 2022 Accepted : 5 October 2022 Check for updates 1 Department of Biology , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA . 2 Department of Physiology , Perelman School of Medicine , University of Penn - sylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA . e - mail : svitkina @ sas . upenn . edu Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ( ) : , ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ( ) : , ; with the clathrin coat itself 18 ( Fig . 1a , left ) . Here , we refer to this model as \u201c edge pushing \u201d mechanism . Our observations made in mammalian cells 18 appear inconsistent with the model proposed for CME in budding yeast 23 \u2013 25 , which postu - lates that while barbed ends of the branched network push onto the plasmamembranearoundtheCCSbase , theolderpartsofthenetwork containing branch junctions are attached to the clathrin coat by molecular linkages , such as Sla2 ( Hip1R in human ) and Ent1 ( epsins in human ) 25 , thus allowing the actin retrograde \ufb02 ow to pull the anchored CCS inward ( Fig . 1a , right ) . This \u201c apical pulling \u201d modelpredictsthat the barbed ends are oriented radially away from the center of the CCS 23 , andthattheinvaginatingCCSsshouldbeextensivelycoveredbystably anchored branched actin \ufb01 laments . Direct visualization of actin orga - nization at CCSs in yeast has not been achieved . Electron microscopy ( EM ) of thin - sectioned plastic - embedded yeast cells revealed a ribosome - free area around CCSs , which contained actin and actin - binding proteins typically associated with branched actin networks 12 , 26 \u2013 28 . However , individual actin \ufb01 laments in this zone were not resolved leaving open the question of how actin \ufb01 laments are organized at endocytic sites . Despite the discrepancy between the predictions of the yeast model of CME 23 \u2013 25 and direct PREM observa - tions in mammalian cells 18 , the apical pulling model is frequently extrapolated , implicitly or explicitly , to mammalian cells 3 , 23 , 24 , 29 \u2013 32 . This trend motivated us to address functional contribution of Arp2 / 3 complex and epsins to morphogenesisofCCSs in multiple mammalian cells . We focused on roles of epsins rather than Hip1R because the Hip1R recruitment to CCSs in mammalian cells depends on epsins 33 . Here , using PREM 34 , 35 to simultaneously visualize the CCS shape and the architecture of CCS - associated actin networks , we show that branched actin polymerization promotes invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs formed on the adherent plasma membranes , thus func - tioning at much earlier CME stages than previously thought . Moreover , we demonstrate that an important component of actin - assisted CCS invagination is an ability of branched actin networks to split large \ufb02 at clathrin - coated plaques into smaller units that subsequently form normally sized clathrin - coated buds and vesi - cles and that this function critically requires the presence of epsin family proteins , whereas epsin localization to CCSs in turn depends on branched actin networks . Branched actin networks mediating both invagination and splitting of CCSs originate not only from preexisting unbranched actin \ufb01 laments , as we reported previously 18 , but strikingly , also from microtubule tips . At all stages of CCS morphogenesis , the branched actin networks are associated with the CCS perimeter and have barbed ends oriented toward the CCS . These data demonstrate that structural organization of CME sites in mammalian cells is incompatible with the apical puling model of actin roles in CME and , therefore , that the mechanisms by which the actin cytoskeleton promotes CME in yeast and mam - malian cells could be signi \ufb01 cantly different . Results Knowledge of actin \ufb01 lament organization in CCS - associated actin patches is absolutely necessary for full understanding of the mechanisms by which the actin polymerization promotes CCS dynamics . Fluorescence microscopy has been instrumental for revealing CCS dynamics in living cells 36 \u2013 39 , but even most advanced versions of superresolution \ufb02 uorescence microscopy are unable to resolve individual actin \ufb01 laments . This task is also challenging for EM due to dense packing of branched actin \ufb01 laments , small sizes of CCS - associated actin patches , and a well - known dif \ufb01 culty of preserving dynamic actin \ufb01 lament networks for EM . PREM is the highest resolu - tion method currently available to reveal structure of three - dimensional actin \ufb01 lament arrays at a single - \ufb01 lament level and over large cellular spaces 34 , 35 . In this study , we exposed the CCSs for PREM analysesinculturedmammaliancellsbyan \u201c unroo \ufb01 ng \u201d procedurethat mechanically removes the cell top while preserving the ventral plasma membrane with associated structures 18 , 40 . Morphological categorization of CCSs in different cell types We investigated the distribution of CCS morphologies and their association with branched actin networks in four mammalian cells types : U2OS and HeLa cells , both endogenously expressing GFP - dynamin2 and RFP - clathrin light chain ( CLC ) 41 , as well as PtK2 and B16F1 cells . We quanti \ufb01 ed frequencies of different CCS categories : \ufb02 at ( Fig . 1b , blueshade ) ; dome - shaped ( Fig . 1b , greenshade ) , andspherical CCSs ( Fig . 1b , orange shade ) . These data showed that U2OS ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , PtK2 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) and HeLa ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3 ) cellshadsubstantial fractions of all three CCS shape categories , whereas B16F1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4a \u2013 e ) contained a negligible amount ( ~ 1 % ) of \ufb02 at CCSs ( Fig . 1e ) . The previously observed distribution ofCCS shapes inHeLa cells 42 isconsistent with our results . The projection area ( Fig . 1f ) and linear dimensions ( Supplementary Fig . 3f , g ) of spherical and dome - shaped CCSs were relatively uniform . In contrast , the size of \ufb02 at CCSs varied broadly from as small as ~ 5\u00d710 3 nm 2 , which corresponded to just a few clathrin polygons ( ~ 70nm in diameter ) ( Fig . 1b , inset ; Supplementary Fig . 3f , g ) , to as large as ~ 200\u00d710 3 nm 2 ( up to 1 \u03bc m across ) . Flat CCSs were remarkable not only because of their size , but also because of the presence of frequent disruptions of the polygonal cla - thrin pattern ( Fig . 1c ) , as reported previously 43 , 44 . These disruptions often followed a linear path , thereby creating \u201c seams \u201d , which divided the clathrin lattice into subdomains approximately of the size of a typical dome - shaped or spherical CCS . The subdomains could exhibit different curvatures within the same large CCS ( Fig . 1d ) , suggesting that large \ufb02 atCCSscan produce endocytic buds and vesicles of regular size , while simultaneously undergoing disassembly , as was observed previously by light microscopy 42 , 45 , 46 . Relationship of branched actin networks and CCSs Structural relationship between a CCS and the associated branched actin networkis a key clue for revealing the mechanism , by which actin dynamics can promote CME . The main outstanding questions are whether the CCS invagination mechanism includes extensive interac - tionsbetweenactin \ufb01 lamentsandtheclathrinlatticeandwhetheractin barbed ends are oriented toward or away from the clathrin lattice . We found that a signi \ufb01 cant subset of CCSs in each morphological category was associated with branched actin networks ( Fig . 1b , yellow shade ) in all examined cell types ( Fig . 1e ) . Importantly , in all cases , the branched actin networks localized adjacent to the CCS and were lar - gely absent from most of its apical surface ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Figs . 1 \u2013 4 , Supplementary Movies 1 \u2013 3 ) . Branched actin networks often originated from long linear actin \ufb01 laments in the background , with which they formed a single - point contact at their pointed - end side ( Fig . 1b , arrows ) 18 . These long \ufb01 laments could serve as original mother \ufb01 laments for initiation of branched nucleation , as well as provide traction allowing ef \ufb01 cient pushing onto the CCS . BranchedactinnetworksthatwereassociatedwithsphericalCCSs often formed a comet tail - like arrangement ( Fig . 2a , b , e ; Supplemen - taryFigs . 2d , h ; 3b , c , and4e , Supplementary Movies1 \u2013 3 ) . Inoccasional side views , we could see that the branched actin network appeared to push onto uncoated ( naked ) membrane at the base of the spherical CCS rather thanon the clathrin coat ( Fig . 2b ) . Branched actin networks also could surround a spherical CCS like a collar with actin \ufb01 lament ends often reaching underneath the vesicle toward its neck while leaving most of the clathrin coat exposed ( e . g . Figure 2c , d ; Supple - mentary Figs . 2f ; 4b , c , Supplementary movies 1 \u2013 3 ) . These structural arrangements are consistent with the idea that the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by membrane - associated nucleation - promoting factors . Peripheral localization of branched actin networks , as well as orienta - tion of actin \ufb01 lament ends toward the CCS , were also apparent in the Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33852 - 2 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 2 B16F1 ( n = 436 ) U2OS ( n = 809 ) PtK2 ( n = 266 ) HeLa ( n = 406 ) 0 100 200 50 150 nm 2 x10 3 Plasma membrane Linker Actin Clathrin a Sphere Sphere ( actin + ) Dome Dome ( actin + ) Flat Flat ( actin + ) B16F1 ( n = 436 ) U2OS ( n = 809 ) PtK2 ( n = 266 ) HeLa ( n = 406 ) e f b c d flat dome sphere 100 % 80 % 60 % 40 % 20 % 0 % Fig . 1 | PREM analysis of CCS morphology . a Two alternative models for actin - dependent invagination of CCSs .

SincewepreviouslyusedB16F1cells , whichlargelylack \ufb02 atCCSs 18 , it remained unclear whether actin \ufb01 laments can function at \ufb02 at CCS . Using other cell types , we found that branched actin networks , sur - prisingly , were also frequently associated with \ufb02 at CCSs , even though the actin cytoskeleton was previously thought to function only at already invaginated CCSs 7 , 9 \u2013 11 . At \ufb02 at CCSs , branched actin networks were typically arranged along the CCS perimeter ( Fig . 2j ; Supplemen - taryFigs . 2g ; 3f ) andsometimesenteredintodeep \u201c bays \u201d intheclathrin lattice ( Fig . 2l ; Supplementary Fig 3h ) . Branched actin networks could also be seen to cross a \ufb02 at CCS in a linear manner , as if following a clathrin lattice seam ( Fig . 2k ; Supplementary Figs . 2g ; 3e ) , or to reside between the neighboring CCSs of different shapes ( Fig . 2m , 0 10 20 % B16F1 ( n = 75 ) U2OS ( n = 182 ) PtK2 ( n = 48 ) HeLa ( n = 86 ) flat dome sphere 0 20 40 % 60 80 flat dome sphere B16F1 ( n = 75 ) U2OS ( n = 182 ) PtK2 ( n = 48 ) HeLa ( n = 86 ) j n o p q r k l m f g h i e d c b a Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33852 - 2 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 4 Supplementary Figs . 2c , d ; 3g ) . In these cases , actin \ufb01 lament ends were oriented toward each of the neighbors , as if pushing them apart . In virtually no cases we observed actin \ufb01 lament branch junctions , where thepointedendsarecapturedbytheArp2 / 3complex , topreferentially overlap with the clathrin lattice while having their barbed ends orien - ted in the centrifugal direction . We observed only minimal overlaps of the branched actin net - work and the clathrin lattice . We argue that a lack of actin interaction with the apical CCS surface is not a consequence of mechanical dis - ruption by unroo \ufb01 ng . To avoid such a concern , for our PREM analyses , we selected samples that retained a high degree of three - dimension - ality , inwhichactinnetworkstypicallyextendedupwardwellabovethe height of CCSs . Yet , these networks encircled the CCSs and did not interact with the interior clathrin lattice . If such arrangements were a result of actin network rupture , then one needs to assume that the unroo \ufb01 ngproceduredrills channelsinthe actin networkexactly above the clathrin lattice , while leaving the networks in immediate vicinity intact , which is clearly an unrealistic suggestion . Moreover , if unroof - ing procedure detached actin from the top of a CCS , it would also shave away other cellular components in the same Z - dimension . However , other structures that accidentally crossed a CCS often remained preserved on the apical CCS surface . Thus , peripheral loca - lization of branched actin networks at CCSs cannot be explained by a loss of apical actin networks due to mechanical impact . The cases of actin - clathrin overlaps , when present , were typically restricted to the CCS edge ( Fig . 2a \u2013 m ; Supplementary Figs . 1 - 4 ) . The average percentage of the CCS projection area overlaid by actin \ufb01 la - ments across all four cell types and all three CCS morphological categories was as low as 7 . 1 \u00b15 . 0 % ( mean \u00b1SD , n = 391 actin - positive CCSs ) ( Fig . 2n ) , suggesting that physical interaction between the cla - thrin coat and the branched actin network cannot be strong . The occasional relatively high values ( still below 30 % ) in this data set ( Fig . 2n ) were rare and resulted from either a small size of the CCS ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) , or a side view of spherical CCS pushed by a comet tail ( Fig . 2e ) , or an unusually large size of the branched actin network ( e . g . Figure2k , m ; SupplementaryFig . 3f ) . Importantly , evenin these cases , orientation of free \ufb01 lament ends ( presumably , barbed ends ) was toward , but not away , from the CCS center ( e . g . red regions in Fig . 2d , e , h , i , j ) . Further support for a lack of robust interaction between actin \ufb01 laments and the clathrin lattice was provided by samples produced by relatively stringent unroo \ufb01 ng . In these cases , most cytoskeletal components were removed , but the remaining bits of actin \ufb01 laments were attached to the CCS perimeter and not to the apical surface of the clathrin lattice ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . These \ufb01 ndings suggest that the plasma membrane just outside of the CCS represents the strongest attachment site for actin \ufb01 laments , whereas anchorage of the network to the lattice itself is weak at best , but more likely is absent altogether . The actin - CCS overlaps were not only miniscule in their area ( Fig . 2n ) , but also observed only in a subset of actin - associated CCSs ( Fig . 2o ) . Importantly , the actin - CCS overlaps were more common for \ufb02 at CCSs , but their frequencies decreased progressively as the CCS curvature increased from \ufb02 at to dome - shaped and then from dome - shaped to spherical CCSs ( Fig . 2o ) . If physical interaction between the clathrin coat and the branched actin network was essential for CCS invagination , we would expect an opposite trend \u2013 more branched actin would be associated with the clathrin lattice of CCSs undergoing active invagination . Therefore , the observed overlaps are more likely explained by an exuberant multidirectional nucleation of daughter \ufb01 laments in branched actin networks , which \ufb01 nd less obstruction at the edges of \ufb02 at CCSs as compared with dome - shaped CCSs , which in turn present less hindrance than spherical CCSs . Moreover , actin \ufb01 la - ments that overlapped with more centralparts of the clathrin lattice in 2D projections exhibited no apparent physical interaction with the apical clathrin coat , if viewed in 3D using tilted PREM images ( Sup - plementary Movies 1 - 3 ) , further arguing against strong interaction between the coat and branched actin \ufb01 laments . If CME in mammalian cells was promoted through extensive interactions of actin \ufb01 laments with the entire clathrin lattice , as pro - posed by the apical pulling model , most CCSs would be concealed underneath branched actin \ufb01 laments in PREM samples , in which case we might miss them . To address this possibility , we examined all dis - crete patches of branched actin networks ( excluding large peripheral networks that likely functioned in membrane protrusion ) in our PREM samples . We found that vast majority of such patches ( 74 . 8 \u2013 88 . 9 % depending on the cell type ) were associated with well - visible CCSs or other vesicles , i . e . caveolae or uncoated vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . The fraction of actin patches , which were not already asso - ciated with vesicles and had an adequate area , density and geometry ( e . g . not too narrow ) to conceal a CCS with a diameter of 125 nm , comprised from 4 . 4 % of allpatches in U2OS cells to 9 . 8 % in B16F1 cells , with intermediate values for PtK2 ( 4 . 8 % ) and HeLa ( 6 . 6 % ) cells ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4h ) . However , even these actin patches typically were rather \ufb02 at with an insuf \ufb01 cient height to conceal a dome - shaped or sphericalCCS . The125nmdiameterisavalueslightlybelowanaverage diameter of dome - shaped and spherical CCSs in our datasets ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4f , g ) , which we chose to be on a conservative side . These data indicate that a fraction of CCSs potentially hidden under - neath branched actin networks is negligible compared with CCSs that obviously interact with branched actin networks only at their perimeter . To further address a minor possibility of structural damage , we performed superresolution \ufb02 uorescence microscopy of phalloidin - stained F - actin and immunolabeled clathrin in intact PtK2 cells by two - color stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) ( Fig . 2p \u2013 r and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We analyzed STORM data using quantitative cluster analysis to de \ufb01 ne actin and clathrin clusters and then performed actin - clathrin colocalization analysis within local region surrounding each clathrin cluster ( see Methods and Supple - mentary Fig . 5a ) . This analysis showed that only 22 . 15\u00b1 14 . 25 % of F - actinlocalizations ( mean\u00b1 SD , n = 5752clathrinclustersfrom10cells in two independent experiments ) colocalized with clathrin clusters ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) , whereas an average density of actin locali - zations was signi \ufb01 cantly lower within the outlines of clathrin clusters Fig . 2 | Branched actin networks localize at the CCS perimeter with minimal overlaps with the clathrin lattice . a \u2013 e Spherical CCSs in U2OS cells .

Earlier observations by diffraction - limited \ufb02 uorescence microscopy 11 and more recent data by super - resolution microscopy 31 also showed that F - actin was spatially off - center of the associated CCSs . The degree of the F - actin / clathrin overlap inour STORM images is likelyoverestimated , because some of colocalized clathrin - F - actin localizations can represent actin \ufb01 laments that push onto the neck of \u03a9 - shaped CCSs or unbranched actin \ufb01 la - ments that are present throughout the cell because phalloidin staining does not distinguish branched and unbranched actin \ufb01 laments . Even with these limitations , the observed low level of overlap is incompa - tible with the idea that CCS invagination heavily relies on the F - actin interaction with the clathrin lattice . Overall , these data show that structural organization of branched actin networks relative to CCSs in mammaliancells is inconsistent with the apical - pulling model proposed for yeast CME , in which actin \ufb01 la - ment barbed ends are predicted to face away from the CCS and older parts of the network containing pointed ends and branch junctions to interact with the clathrin coat and be present on its apical surface . Arp2 / 3 inhibition blocks CCS invagination and size control The actin cytoskeleton in budding yeast stimulates invagination of newly formed \ufb02 at CCSs 2 , 12 , whereas in mammalian cells actin dynamics is thought to function only after the initial invagination has been accomplished by other mechanisms 7 , 9 \u2013 11 . However , the frequent asso - ciation of branched actin networks with \ufb02 atCCSs in our PREM samples suggested that actin polymerization can also promote invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs in mammalian cells . To test this idea , we investigated the effects of CK - 666 , a speci \ufb01 c inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex , on CCS morphogenesis . Treatment was performed in a low - serum ( 0 . 1 % FBS ) mediumforef \ufb01 cientinhibitionoftheArp2 / 3complex . Whencellswere treated with CK - 666 in the presence of 2 - 10 % FBS , they still retained abundant uninhibited branched actin networks that can be seen by PREM . Although somebranched networks werestill detectable even at 0 . 1 % FBS , the ef \ufb01 ciency of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition by CK - 666 was much improved . PREM analysis of CK - 666 - treated PtK2 ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Movie 4 ) , U2OS ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) and HeLa ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) cells demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition led to severe depletion of invaginated ( dome - shaped and spherical ) CCSs , accompanied by a dramatic increase in the frequency and size of \ufb02 at CCSs ( Fig . 3g , h ; Supplementary Figs . 6f , g ; 7f , g ) . As compared with cells cultured in the presence of 10 % FBS , treatment with 0 . 1 % FBS and DMSO also increased the frequency and size of \ufb02 at CCSs ( likely because low - serum conditions dampen Arp2 / 3 complex activation ) , although to a much lesser degree than CK - 666 treatment ( Fig . 3g , h ) . Importantly , CCSs in cells incubated with 0 . 1 % FBS remained extensively associated with branched actin networks ( Fig . 3a \u2013 d , g ; Supplementary Figs . 6a ; 7a , b , Supplemen - tary Movie 5 ) , whereas majority of CCSs in CK - 666 - treated samples lacked associated branched actin networks . Long unbranched actin \ufb01 laments were seen throughout the sample , with and without CK - 666 treatment , and could occasionally be found in the CCS vicinity or even cross the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 3e , f ; Supplementary Figs . 6b , c ; 7c , d , Supplementary Movie 4 ) , but they did not appear to have a functional relationship with CCSs . Uninhibited branched actin networks only infrequently were found in CK - 666 - treated samples , and they were usually rather small ( Fig . 3f ; Supplementary Figs . 6b , c ; 7c , Supplementary Movie 4 ) . The incomplete inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex activity could be responsible for a small proportion of remaining dome - shaped and spherical CCSs ( e . g . Figure 3f , Sup - plementary Fig . 6c ) . The CK - 666 treatment even induced numerous \ufb02 at CCSs in B16F1 cells , which virtually lacked \ufb02 at CCSs in normal conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , even though Arp2 / 3 complex was only partially inhibited in this case , because we used milder treatment conditions ( 10 % FBS , 100 \u03bc M CK - 666 for 1 h ) to avoid cell detachment in this sensitive cell type . Consistent with the known adhesive functions of clathrin plaques in some cell types 6 , 13 , the \ufb02 at CCSs in CK - 666 - treated U2OS and HeLa cells appeared to serve as cell adhesion sites . Indeed , after strong unroo \ufb01 ng when most of the cellular components were removed by sonication , the remaining plasma membrane fragments almost invariably contained , or even were fully occupied by \ufb02 at CCSs ( Sup - plementary Figs . 6d ; 7e ) . We also noticed some peculiar rod - shaped structures in CK - 666 - treated samples in all three tested cell types ( PtK2 , U2OS and HeLa ) , which appeared as bundles of \u201c beaded \u201d strands ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . We never detected such structures in untreated cells . They likely represent actin - co \ufb01 lin rods , which are formed in cells under stressful conditions or when monomeric actin is present in excess 47 . Inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex impairs CCS dynamics We next sought to evaluate the effects of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition using TIRF microscopy of intact cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Treatment with CK - 666 led to the formation of large clathrin - positive structures instead of typical small scattered dots ( Fig . 4a \u2013 c ) . Quanti \ufb01 cation of TIRF micro - scopy images showed a signi \ufb01 cant increase in the CCS area in all three examined cell types ( Fig . 4d ) , consistent with our PREM data , but shown for intact cells . To evaluate CCS dynamics after downregulation of Arp2 / 3 complex activity , weperformed livecell imagingby TIRF microscopy of U2OS and HeLa cells endogenously expressing RFP - CLC and treated with DMSO or CK - 666 in low serum conditions ( Fig . 4e \u2013 l , Supplementary Movie 6 ) . By measuring CCS lifetimes in kymographs generated from 10 - min long sequences ( Fig . 4e \u2013 h ) , we found that an average CCS lifetime per cell was dramatically increased after CK - 666 treatment for both U2OS ( Fig . 4i ) and HeLa ( Fig . 4k ) cells . Fur - thermore , in kymographs of control DMSO - treated cells , most CCS traces were shorter than the length of the movie ( 600 sec ) indicating dynamic appearance and / or disappearance of CCSs . In contrast , after CK - 666 treatment , a large fraction of CCSs was present throughout the movie ( Fig . 4j , l ) . Thus , inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex not only increases the size of CCSs , but also severely stalls their dynamics . Together , our experiments addressing the roles of the Arp2 / 3 complex in CME show that assembly of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin networks is required for CCS invagination and dynamics in mammalian cells . Moreover , the accumulation of very large \ufb02 at CCSs after inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that branched net - works also regulate the proper size of CCSs to make them suitable for CME . Restored actin networks drive CCS division and invagination The pharmacological approach uniquely allows monitoring the time course of recovery after removal of the inhibitor with high temporal resolution . In our case , we washed out CK - 666 to determine how newly restored branched actin networks reverse the phenotype of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition . The cells were then unroofed with ~ 30 s intervals and examined by PREM ( Figs . 5 and 6 , Supplementary Movies 7 - 10 ) . The CCS - associated branched actin networks reappeared already after 30 s of CK - 666 washout and increased over time in size and fre - quency ( Fig . 5a ) . In parallel , the fraction and size of \ufb02 at CCSs pro - gressively decreased , while fractions of dome - shaped and spherical CCSs increased , until by the 2 min time point the distribution of CCS morphologies wasroughlysimilarto thatof untreated cells ( Fig . 5a , b ) . The patches of branched actin networks formed after 0 . 5 - min washout were relatively small and located at the edges of \ufb02 at CCSs ( Fig . 5c , d , pink arrowheads ; Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Interestingly , they were also found in the bays of the clathrin lattice and along the Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33852 - 2 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 6 lattice seams ( Fig . 5c \u2013 j , yellow arrowheads ) , suggesting that bran - ched actin networks might create these bays and were actively involved in the division of \ufb02 at CCSs by invading into CCS seams and pushing them apart . The decrease in the area of \ufb02 at CCSs that was observed already at the 0 . 5 min time point most likely re \ufb02 ected the division of preexisting \ufb02 at CCSs . Actin assembly along CCSs margins was clearly increased after 1 min of CK - 666 washout , when small patches of branched actin network converted into elongated strands 0 20 40 60 80 100 % SphereDomeFlat SphereDomeFlat a c t i n + 10 % FBS ( n = 103 ) 0 . 1 % FBS ( n = 137 ) CK - 666 ( n = 343 ) 0 500 1000 250 750 nm 2 x 10 3 a b c d e e f g h flat Fig . 3 | Inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex results in accumulation of large \ufb02 at CCSs at the expense of other CCS categories . a \u2013 d Control PtK2 cells cultured in the presence of0 . 1 % FBS and DMSOexhibit \ufb02 at , dome - shaped and spherical CCSs , someofwhichareassociatedwithbranchedactinnetworks ( arrows ) . e , f PtK2cells treated with 200 \u03bc M CK - 666 in the presence of 0 . 1 % FBS contain very large \ufb02 at CCSs occasionally associated with small remaining patches of branched actin network ( arrow ) .

The invasion of branched networks into CCS seams and bays became more obvious ( Fig . 5e \u2013 j , yellow arrowheads ) . Moreover , signi \ufb01 cant fractions of CCSs became dome - shaped and spherical indicating resumption of CCS invagination , which was blocked in the absence of Arp2 / 3complex activity . Thenewly formed invaginated CCSs were typically associated with branched actin networks abutting their perimeter ( Fig . 5f \u2013 j , cyan arrowheads ) , thus further supporting the idea that branched actin polymerization promotes CCS invagination . The progressive decrease in the fraction and size of \ufb02 at CCSs accompanied by an increase in the fractions of invaginated CCSs ( Fig . 5a , b ) continued after 1 . 5 and 2 min of recovery ( Fig . 6 ; Supple - mentary Movies 9 , 10 ) . At these time points , most actin networks partially or completely surrounded the CCSs ( Fig . 6 , pink and red arrowheads , respectively ) or localized between CCSs ( Fig . 6 , yellow arrowheads ) . Remarkably , invaginated CCSs at these late stages of recovery were frequently found in clusters , in which individual CCSs were separated by branched actin networks ( Fig . 6e , g ) . These clusters most likely were formed from preexisting large \ufb02 at CCSs through division and invagination promoted by branched actin networks . After 2 min washout , a signi \ufb01 cant fraction of branched actin networks formed comet tails at a side of spherical CCSs ( Fig . 6 , cyan arrow - heads ) . Importantly , at all stages of recovery , branched actin networks were still localized at the edges of clathrin lattices with only minimal overhangs formed by extending \ufb01 lament ends .

Since recruitment of Hip1R depends on epsins 33 , 49 , we focused here on roles of epsins in invagination and severing of \ufb02 at CCSs . We used conditional epsin knockout mouse embryo \ufb01 broblasts ( MEFs ) , whichlack the epsin2 and epsin3 genes , while the \ufb02 oxed epsin1 gene canbe deleted in the course of several days by 4 - hydroxy - tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT ) - inducible Cre recombinase 33 . In the absence of 4 - OHT , TIRF microscopy of epsin2 / 3 double knockout ( DKO ) MEFs transfected with GFP - CLC revealed a typical pattern of numerous small puncta that exhibited active dynamics with short lifetimes , whereas only a small fraction of CCSs lasted the entire 10 - minmovie ( Fig . 7a , e , f , SupplementaryMovie11 ) . TreatmentofDKO MEFs with CK - 666 led to a signi \ufb01 cant increase in the average CCS size and stalled CCS dynamics ( Fig . 7b , e , f ; Supplementary Movie 11 ) , similar to other cell types ( Fig . 4 ) . Remarkably , the 4 - OHT treatment of DKO MEFs for 5 days to produce triple knockout ( TKO ) MEFs closely mimicked the CK - 666 treatment phenotype ( Fig . 7c , e , f ; Supplemen - tary Movie 12 ) , whereas treatment of TKO cells with CK - 666 did not induce additional statistically signi \ufb01 cant changes ( Fig . 7d , e , f ; Sup - plementary Movie 12 ) . The similar phenotypes of epsin TKO and Arp2 / 3 inhibition , together with a lack of CK - 666 effect on TKO cells , strongly suggest that epsin and Arp2 / 3 complex function in the same pathway . PREM analysisof DKO and TKO ( 5 days of 4 - OHT treatment ) MEFs demonstrated that depletion of epsins , similar to Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition , resulted in the formation of abundant large \ufb02 at CCSs at the expense of dome - shaped and spherical CCSs ( Fig . 7g \u2013 l ) . Consistent with the previous light microscopy data 33 , branched actin networks were still abundantly present in association with CCSs in epsin TKO cells . These data suggest that in the absence of epsins branched actin networks are unable to transmit force to CCS to induce their invagination . Given that epsins themselves are able to induce membrane curvature 50 , 51 , it was possible that impaired CCS invagination resulted from compromised localization of epsins in the presence of CK - 666 . To test this possibility , we applied CK - 666 or DMSO to Ptk2 cells ectopicallyexpressingmCherry - CLCandEGFP - epsin1 andimagedcells by TIRF microscopy ( Fig . 7m \u2013 q ) . Before CK - 666 application , or before and after DMSO treatment , epsin1 formed bright puncta that strongly colocalized with CLC puncta , as well as exhibited diffuse \ufb02 uorescence at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7m , n , o ) . However , after 2 h incubation with CK - 666 , we measured a signi \ufb01 cant decrease in the percentage of CLC - positive puncta colocalizing with epsin1 ( Fig . 7q ) , as well as sig - ni \ufb01 cant reductions in the number of epsin1 puncta ( from 7 . 7\u00b13 . 2 to 3 . 6 \u00b12 . 3 puncta per 100 \u03bc m 2 ) and their \ufb02 uorescence intensity ( by 77 . 6 \u00b17 . 5 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ; Wilcoxon matched pairs test ; n = 20 cells from two independent experiments for both quanti \ufb01 cations ) . These data show that assembly of branched actin networks promotes accumula - tion of epsin at CCSs . Microtubules can initiate actin networks growing toward CCSs Microtubules are known to regulate various activities of the actin cytoskeleton . We recently discovered a new aspect of such regula - tion \u2014 an ability of microtubule tips to initiate assembly of branched actin networks , which in turn stimulate the leading edge protrusion in neuronal growth cones 52 . Remarkably , in our unroofed PREM samples we found multiple examples of branched actin networks associated with microtubule tips ( Fig . 8a \u2013 g , Supplementary Movie 13 ) . In some cases , these microtubule - associated branched actin networks did not have obvious relation to CCSs ( Fig . 8a \u2013 c ) and could contribute to other functions of branched actin networks , such as membrane protrusion ( e . g . Figure 8a ) . However , in many other cases , branched actin networks originated from microtubule tips and extended toward CCSs of various morphologies , including spherical ( Fig . 8d , e , g ) , dome - shaped ( Fig . 8d , g ) and \ufb02 at ( Fig . 8d \u2013 f ) CCSs . Microtubule - associated branched actin networks could even be found in CK - 666 - treated cells ( Fig . 8h ) , although branched actin net - works in general were scarce in these cells , and the majority of microtubule tips lacked associated actin . Upon CK - 666 washout , branched actin networks gradually reappeared at the microtubule tips ( Fig . 8i \u2013 l ) , often in con \ufb01 gurations that are expected to push onto the edges of \ufb02 at CCSs , thus promoting their division and invagination . Discussion The key outstanding questions in the CME \ufb01 eld are the mechanism of plasma membrane invagination and the source of energy driving this process . Clathrin oligomerization and actin polymerization are the main molecular machineries driving CCS invagination , although var - ious accessory proteins also contribute 4 , 8 , 53 . Using high resolution structural analysis by PREM combined with a functional \u201c block - and - release \u201d approach we have advanced our understanding of the actin - dependent mechanismof CCS invagination on adherent plasma membranes in mammalian cells . First , we show that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization is required for invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs . Previously , it was thought that actin poly - merization promotes CME at later CME stages , while the initial curva - ture is produced by other mechanisms 7 , 11 . Second , we uncover a previously unknown aspect of actin - assisted CCS morphogenesis \u2013 severing of large \ufb02 at clathrin lattices into smaller domains that sub - sequently produce normally sized clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Third , we show that branched actin networks promoting both invagi - nation and severing of CCSs act from the CCS perimeter without obviousinteractionwiththeapicalclathrinlattice . Forth , wefoundthat epsin family proteins are required for transmitting force from actin polymerization to CCS invagination , whereasbranched actin networks in turn promote epsin accumulation at CCSs . Finally , we discovered that CCS - associated branched actin networks can be initiated from microtubule tips . Feasibility of the \ufb02 at - to - curved transition for clathrin lattices has long been a matter of debate . On one hand , high preferenceof clathrin for the formation of curved shapes and extensive intertwining of triskelion legs in the clathrin lattice 53 suggested that restructuring of the clathrin coat is energetically unrealistic 54 . On the other hand , experimental data support the actual existence of \ufb02 at - to - curved CCS transitions in cells 12 , 43 , 55 \u2013 58 . The latter idea is also supported by our current data . In contrast to prior studies which examined constitutive CME , we experimentally induced expansive \ufb01 elds of \ufb02 at clathrin lat - tices and then triggered their nearly synchronous invagination . This functionalapproachprovidesstrongevidencefortheregulated \ufb02 at - to - curved clathrin lattice transition in cells . The con \ufb01 rmed ability of \ufb02 at clathrin lattices to invaginate still does not answer the question how they do so . Intrinsic clathrin prop - erties , such as a puckered shape of triskeleons and the clathrin ability to form both hexagons and pentagons , are well - suited for promoting membrane invagination 59 , 60 , but also suggest that the \ufb02 at conforma - tion of clathrin lattices might be energetically unfavorable . The forces that \ufb02 atten the clathrin lattice in cells against their preferred curva - tures are not entirely clear , but likely depend on the membrane ten - sion , cell adhesion and contribution of CLCs and other endocytic accessory proteins 53 , 61 , 62 . These forces , regardless of their nature , need to be overcome to enable productive CME and turnover of adhesive clathrin plaques . The ability of the clathrin lattice to curve by itself when the \ufb02 at - tening force is weakened is supported by the experiments , in which mechanical rupture of individual polygon edges led to invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs 63 . Even plain incubation of unroofed cells in a buffer induced spontaneous invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs 64 , 65 , which could be accelerated by buffer acidi \ufb01 cation 57 . Apparently , incubation in a buffer caused Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33852 - 2 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 11 gradual deterioration of clathrin plaque adhesion , thus releasing the \ufb02 attening force . Restructuring of the clathrin lattice in these condi - tions was likely made possible by the presence of pentagons found even in \ufb02 at lattices 64 , 65 and incomplete saturation of lattices with cla - thrin molecules 66 . The fact that clathrin lattice can invaginate by itself if experi - mentally released from the \ufb02 attening force raises the question of what mechanism naturally releases the \ufb02 attening force in living cells .

In mammalian cells , however , pharmacological depolymerization or stabilization of actin \ufb01 laments stalled CCSs in the U - or \u03a9 - shaped con \ufb01 guration , suggesting that invagination per se was not inhibited 7 , 9 \u2013 11 . Therefore , it was unclear whether actin polymerization can promote initial invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs in mammalian cells . Our data now de \ufb01 nitively show that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent branched actin polymerization promotes initial invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs on adherent plasma membranes in mammalian cells . This \ufb01 nding does not mean that \ufb02 at clathrin lattices are necessary pre - cursors for pits and vesicles . For example , \ufb02 at lattices are not detected inB16F1cellsinnormalconditions . What ourdata suggest is that if \ufb02 at CCSs do form , they are remodeled into curved ones in an actin - dependent manner . Indeed , Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition blocked CCS invagination , but invagination resumed after drug washout . Consistent with our data , previous studies showed that genetic or pharmacological downregulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex led to ~ 50 % decrease in cargo uptake by CME 68 , 69 . It was important , however , to ef \ufb01 ciently block branched actin assembly to achieve this result , which might not be done in prior studies . Under strict control of PREM , we found that at normal serum concentrations , CK - 666 was less ef \ufb01 cient , either because of partial inactivation by some serum factors or because serum agonists too strongly boosted Arp2 / 3 complex activation . During recovery from inhibition , \ufb02 at lattices converted into spherical vesicles through intermediate formation of dome - shaped buds . A novel aspect of the actin - promoted CCS turnover is that bran - ched actin networks can be assembled in the vicinity of CCSs not only from unbranched actin \ufb01 laments in the background 18 , but also with help of microtubules . The branched actin networks growing from the microtubule tips observed in this study closely resemble analogous structures that we recently discovered in neuronal growth cones 52 . In that study , we found that the assembly of branched actin networks at the microtubule tips , and even more remarkably , throughout the growth cone , required the presence of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ( APC ) , a tumor suppressor protein that alsofunctions asa microtubule plus end - tracking protein ( + TIP ) 70 . A mechanism underlying the for - mation of microtubule - associated branched actin networks likely involves an APC - dependent assembly of signaling complexes at microtubuletips , whichthenleadto activation of Arp2 / 3complex , and consequently to a local production of pushing force for precise navi - gation of growth cone advance 52 , 70 . Our current data reveal that this type of microtubule - actin crosstalk is not unique for neuronal growth cones or for leading edge protrusion , but also functions in non - neuronal cells and for a different purpose \u2013 clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis \u2013 demonstrate that microtubule - associated assembly of bran - ched actin networks has a much broader range of functions in cells than could be assumed based on a single experimental system . In the context of CME , in addition to initiating branched actin nucleation , microtubules can also provide traction for the actin network , thus directing pushing force toward the CCS . Microtubules also might regulate turnover of adhesive clathrin plaques in analogy with microtubule - dependent disassembly of focal adhesions 71 . A very interesting but still open question is how actin poly - merization promotes CCS invagination . The widely held \u201c apical pull - ing \u201d model proposed for CME in yeast 12 , 24 , 25 suggests that the retrograde \ufb02 ow of the branched actin network drags the attached clathrin coat inward ( Fig . 1a , right ) . Our data strongly show that this model does not apply to mammalian cells . Indeed , we \ufb01 nd that bran - ched actin networks barely , if at all , overlap with the clathrin coat , which is especially clear when actin organization at CCSs is viewed in 3D ( see Supplementary Movies 1 - 3 , 5 , 7 - 10 , 13 ) . This fact con \ufb02 icts with the postulated existence of strong actin - coat linkages . Furthermore , we \ufb01 nd that barbed ends of the CCS - associated branched actin net - worksinmammalian cellsare predominantly orientedtowardthe CCS , thus contrasting the apical pulling model , which predicts that barbed ends should be oriented away from the clathrin lattice 23 . Therefore , a different actin - dependent mechanism promotes CCS invagination in mammalian cells . The actual structure of CCS - actin assemblies suggests instead an \u201c edge pushing \u201d mechanism in which branched actin networks push onto the perimeter of the clathrin lattice in order to promote invagi - nation , neckconstrictionandvesicledeparture ( Fig . 8m ) . Interestingly , theoretical modeling has revealed that the \ufb02 at - to - curved lattice tran - sition is best explained by an increase of the line tension along the clathrin coat boundary 72 , which nicely matches our data . Furthermore , branched actin polymerization has been shown to induce phase separation of lipids in model membranes 73 , which perhaps can lead to line tension generation 74 . Therefore , one possibility is that branched actin networks by pushing at the membrane - clathrin lattice boundary increase the line tension at CCSs to release the \ufb02 attening force and promote invagination of CCSs . An important question is how the force generated by polymeriz - ing actin \ufb01 laments is transmitted to the clathrin lattice to induce invagination . A key role in this process , both in yeast and mammalian cells , is thought to belong to epsins ( Ent1 / 2 in yeast ) and Hip1R ( Sla2 in yeast ) , which can bind actin \ufb01 laments , CLCs and the plasma mem - brane , as well as each other 25 , 33 , 48 . Downregulation of either all three mammalian epsins or Hip1R alone produced similar phenotypes characterized by an impaired cargo uptake and accumulation of early U - shaped CCSs , which were more extensively associated with F - actin 33 , 48 . Together with similar data from yeast 25 , these \ufb01 ndings suggest that epsins and Hip proteins function together to make actin polymerization ef \ufb01 cient in promoting CME . Given that localization of Hip1R to CCSs depends on epsin 33 , 49 and that Hip1R cannot bind CLC and actin simultaneously 75 , we focused here on the roles of epsins . We show that , similar to Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition , epsin downregulation blocked invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs without inhibiting branched actin networks per se . These \ufb01 ndings supportthe idea thatepsin - dependent force transmission from actin to CCSs is required for CME . Impor - tantly , we show that this mechanism begins to work already for \ufb02 at Fig . 7 | KnockoutofepsinsmimicsthephenotypeofArp2 / 3complexinhibition . a \u2013 d ( toprow ) FirstframesofTIRFmicroscopytime - lapsesequencesofEGFP - CLCin epsin conditional DKO MEFs treated with either ethanol ( a , b ; labeled \u201c DKO \u201d ) or 4 - OHT ( c , d ; labeled \u201c TKO \u201d ) for 5 days and then with either DMSO ( a , c ) or 100 \u03bc M CK - 666 ( b , d ) for 4h .

Surprisingly , we also found that Arp2 / 3 complex activity is needed for ef \ufb01 cient epsin accumulation at CCSs suggesting a feedback mechanism between actin polymerization and epsin localization than requires investigation . According to the apical pulling model , epsin / Ent1 and Hip1R / Sla2 link actin \ufb01 laments to the entire surface of CCSs , suggesting that these proteins should be distributed throughout the clathrin lattice . How - ever , high resolution analyses in mammalian cells point to peripheral localization of both epsins 76 \u2013 78 and Hip1R 79 , although the data on Hip1R localization are more controversial 44 , 80 . Localization of epsin to the edge of clathrin lattice is consistent with the edge pushing model , but not with theapicalpulling model . The exactmechanism by whichactin polymerization transmits force through epsin to induce CCS invagi - nation remains to be fully unveiled . Given that CLCs regulate clathrin lattice dynamics and architecture 81 \u2013 85 , one possibility is that poly - merizing actin \ufb01 laments use epsins as an intermediate to mechanically induce conformational changes in CLCs and thus release an inhibitory action of CLC on clathrin lattice bending .

Large clathrin plaques can serve as cell - matrix adhesions , signal - ing platforms and mechanosensory devices 6 , 13 , 86 , 87 . All these functions requireclathrinplaquestobeadaptive , andthereforeregulated . These regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood . Various physical , chemicalandbiochemicalmanipulationscanincreasetheformationof \ufb02 at clathrin plaques in cells 57 , 88 \u2013 91 . The reverse process \u2013 plaque turn - over \u2013 requiresactinpolymerizationtriggeredby N - WASP ( activatorof the Arp2 / 3 complex ) 14 , although it remained unclear how actin poly - merization accomplishes this task . We uncovered an unexpected pathway by which actin poly - merizationpromotesturnoveroflarge \ufb02 atCCS . Surprisingly , branched actin networks appear to cut \ufb02 at clathrin lattices into smaller sections , which subsequently invaginate to form normally - sized domes and vesicles . This severing function can also enable turnover of large cla - thrin plaques , which serve as cell adhesion sites 6 , 13 . When cells are recovering from Arp2 / 3 complex inhibition , branched actin networks appear to \u201c burrow \u201d into \ufb02 at CCSs from their edges and are eventually found between neighboring CCSs , probably separated by these net - works . These events can also be seen in live cells . The CCS severing by branched actin networks also occurs constitutively , as can be deduced from the accumulation of large \ufb02 at CCSs after Arp2 / 3 complex inhi - bition and from the presence of actin networks in the bays of \ufb02 at clathrin lattices , as well as between adjacent CCSs , in untreated cells . Events , in which F - actin was recruited to clefts between separating CCSs , as if pushing them apart , were previously revealed by TIRF microscopy of live cells 11 . It is interesting that actin networks tend to spread not only along the CCS perimeter , but also along the lattice seams . Perhaps , seams offer an easier access to the plasma membrane fortheupstreamregulatorsofArp2 / 3complex , suchasN - WASPandits activators . Branched actin networks are able not only cut large \ufb02 at lattices , but likely also prevent their formation , when they are not needed . Given that the Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by numerous signaling pathways , this mechanism can control the formation and turnover of \ufb02 at clathrin lattices in response to external signals . The time course of the resumed CCS dynamics after CK666 washout suggests that severing of \ufb02 at CCSs into smaller fragments is a prerequisite of clathrin lattice invagination . If we assume that the \ufb02 attening forcein our experimental conditions chie \ufb02 y results fromthe clathrinlatticeadhesion , whichlikelyscaleswiththeCCSarea , thenthe line tension , which should be proportional to the CCS perimeter , would more ef \ufb01 ciently release the \ufb02 attening force in small CCSs with a greater perimeter / area ratio . If the \ufb02 attening force mainly results from high membrane tension , the radial inward directed pushing force generated by branched actin networks can locally release membrane tension underneath the CCS and promote its invagination . Based on our results , we propose the edge pushing model to explaina mechanism by which branched actin networks promote CME ( Fig . 8m ) . A key point of thismodel isthatactin \ufb01 laments exert forceat the boundary of the clathrin lattice while being localized outside the CCS except for a few actin \ufb01 lament ends that \u201c missed the target \u201d while polymerizing . This edge pushing mechanism promotes severing and invagination of \ufb02 at clathrin lattices ( Fig . 8m , i ) , as we have shown here , butalsosupportssubsequentstagesof CME ( Fig . 8m , ii - iv ) , ashas been suggested by previous studies 4 , 11 , 18 . Speci \ufb01 cally , the branched actin networks that propagate along the CCS perimeter during CCS invagi - nation and form a full or partial \u201c collar \u201d around the neck of U - shaped CCSs can promote neck constriction ( Fig . 8m , ii ) . Interestingly , a mechanical model of neck constriction suggested that asymmetric radialpressureontothe baseoftheneck encounters the lowestenergy barrier , as compared with symmetric circumferential pressure or pressure at more apical levels of a bud 92 . These conclusions are con - sistent with our experimental observations that invaginating CCSs are often associated with an incomplete collar of branched actin network at theirbase , although nearly complete collars arealsooften observed . At the next stage , multiple rounds of branched actin nucleation at the neck of \u03a9 - shaped CCSs produce barbed ends that are oriented both toward and away from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 8m , iii ) . By working against each other , these ends elongate the neck while continue con - stricting it . After vesicle scission , the network consolidates into a comet tail , which drives the departure of the clathrin - coated vesicle from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 8m , iv ) . In conclusion , we show that Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent actin polymerization is able to sever large \ufb02 at clathrin lattices into smaller domains and promote invagination of \ufb02 at CCSs , in both cases acting from the CCS perimeter without obvious interaction with the apical clathrin lattice , while requiring epsins to function as intermediates . Strikingly , CCS - associated actin networks can be induced at micro - tubule tips . The ability of branched actin networks to divide and invaginate large \ufb02 at CCSs has dual importance . On one hand , it can promoteef \ufb01 cient CME inconditionsofhigh membrane tension and / or strong cell adhesion . On the other hand , it can facilitate turnover of adhesive / signaling clathrin plaques and thereby promote cell migra - tion and modulate cell signaling .

For unroo \ufb01 ng experiments , B16F1 cells were seeded on cover - slips coated with laminin ( 25 \u00b5 g / ml , # L2020 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and Ptk2 , U2OS and Hela cells were seeded on coverslips coated with poly - D - lysine ( 0 . 2mg / ml , # P6407 , Sigma - Aldrich ) or HistoGrip ( 1 : 50 dilution , # 008050 , Thermo Fisher Scienti \ufb01 c ) 94 , 95 . Epsin DKO and TKO MEFs were cultured on uncoated glass coverslips . B16F1 cells were unroofed as described previously 18 . For unroo \ufb01 ng of other cells , coverslips with cells were quickly transferred into ice - cold PEM buffer ( 100 mM PIPES \u2212 KOH , pH 6 . 9 , 1mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM EGTA ) containing 2 \u00b5 M unlabeled phalloidin ( # P2141 , Sigma ) and , in some experiments , 10 \u00b5 M taxol ( # T7402 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and unroofed by a brief ( 1 s ) ultrasonic burst from a 1 / 8 - inch microprobe positioned at ~ 45\u00b0 angle ~ 3 mm above the coverslip and operated by Misonix XL2020 Ultrasonic Pro - cessor at 17 \u2013 20 % of output power . After sonication , the coverslips were immediately \ufb01 xed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M Na - cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 3 for at least 20 min at room temperature . Sample processing for PREM was performed as described previously 96 , 97 . In brief , glutaraldehyde - \ufb01 xed cells were post - \ufb01 xed by sequential treatment with 0 . 1 % tannic acid and 0 . 2 % uranyl acetate in water , critical - point dried , coated with platinum and carbon , and transferred onto EM grids for observation . PREM samples were examined using JEM 1011 transmission elec - tron microscope ( JEOL USA , Peabody , MA ) operated at 100kV . Images were acquired by an ORIUS 832 . 10 W CCD camera driven by Gatan Digital Micrograph 1 . 8 . 4 software ( Gatan , Warrendale , PA ) and pre - sented in inverted contrast . Stereo images were acquired at tilt angles ranging from \u2212 20 to + 20\u00b0 and presented as video animations . Fluorescence microscopy For immuno \ufb02 uorescence staining , Ptk2 cells were quickly rinsed with PBS at 37\u00b0C , \ufb01 xed with 4 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sci - ences ) in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 10min , washed three times with PBS , 5min each , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10min at room temperature , washed with PBS again , and blocked overnight with 5 % BSA in PBS at 4 \u00b0C . Cells then were incubated with mouse monoclonal X - 22 clathrinheavy chain antibody ( # Ab2731 , Abcam ; 1 : 1000 in 5 % BSA in PBS ) for 45 min at room temperature . After washing \ufb01 ve times with 0 . 2 % BSA and 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , cells were incubated for 30min with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti - mouse IgG secondary antibody ( # A11032 , Thermo Fisher Scienti \ufb01 c , 1 : 500 in 5 % BSA in PBS ) for TIRF microscopy . For STORM imaging , a secondary mouse antibody custom - labeled with Alexa Fluor 405 - Alexa Fluor A647 activator / reporter dye pair 98 wasused at1 : 75 dilution in combinationwith Alexa - 488 phalloidin ( # 8878 ) , Cell Signaling , 1 : 100 in 5 % BSA in PBS . For \ufb02 uorescencemicroscopy , thefollowingexpressionconstructs were used : EGFP - or mCherry - tagged clathrin light chain A ( EGFP - CLC and pmCherry - CLC , respectively , gifts from J . Keen , Jefferson University , Philadelphia , PA , USA ) 37 , cortactin - pmCherryC1 ( Addgene , # 27676 , a gift from C . Merri \ufb01 eld , MedicalResearch Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , UK ) 39 , and pEGFP - C1 - Epsin1 ( Addgene , # 22228 , a gift from P . De Camilli , Yale University , Con - necticut , USA ) . For live - cell imaging , cells were cultured in the glass - bottomed MatTek dishes in phenol red - free L - 15 medium supple - mented with 10 % or 0 . 1 % FBS and maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidi \ufb01 ed atmosphere during observation using an UNO stage - top incubator ( Okolab ) . For CK - 666 washout experiments , PtK2 cells were cotrans - fected with EGFP - CLC and cortactin - pmCherry and treated with CK - 666 as described above . After acquiring single images at multiple positions in the presence of the drug , CK - 666 was washed out using three sequential medium exchanges and time - lapse sequences were acquired . For life cell imaging of epsin DKO and TKO MEFs , cells were transfected with EGFP - CLC using Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent ( Thermo Fisher ) after 2 days of treatment with 3 \u03bc M 4 - OHT or EtOH , cultured for additional 2 days in 1 \u03bc M 4 - OHT or EtOH , replated into glass - bottomed MatTek dishes , cultured overnight in DMEM with 10 % FBSand 1 \u03bc M4 - OHTorEtOH , and \ufb01 nally transferredtophenolred - free L - 15 medium ( # 21083027 , Gibco ) for imaging . For monitoring effects of CK - 666 on epsin localization , Ptk2 cells were transfected with pmCherry - CLC and pEGFP - C1 - Epsin1 and treated with CK - 666 as described above but for 2h . TIRF microscopy was performed using Eclipse TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a CFI Apochromat TIRF 100 \u00d7 1 . 49 NA oil objective , iXon3 DU - 897 back - illuminated EMCCD camera ( Andor ) and a perfect focus system driven by Nikon ( NIS ) - Elements AdvancedResearchsoftware ( Version4 . 50 ) . The488 nmlaserand 525 / 50 \ufb01 lter were used for EGFP , the 561nm laser and 605 / 70 \ufb01 lter were used for RFP , and the 594 nm laser and 632 / 50 \ufb01 lter were used for pmCherry . To minimize photobleaching , low laser power and expo - sure times and a digital gain were used . STORM super - resolution imaging was performed in Hilo ( highly inclined laminated optical sheet ) illumination mode using a Nanoi - mager S microscope from Oxford Nanoimaging , equipped with a 100\u00d71 . 4 NA oil immersion objective and Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 V3 sCMOS camera . Images were acquired using alternating illumina - tion with 473 nm and 647nm laser and 15 ms exposure time . Total of 30 , 000 frames were recorded per image . 405nm laser was used to induce \ufb02 uorophore activation . Imaging was carried out in the OxEA buffer [ 50 mM \u03b2 - Mercaptoethylamine hydrochloride ( MEA , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 3 % ( v / v ) OxyFlour \u2122 ( Oxyrase Inc . , Mans \ufb01 eld , Ohio , U . S . A . ) , 20 % ( v / v ) of sodium DL - lactate solution ( L1375 , Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS , pH 8 \u2013 8 . 5 adjusted with NaOH ] 99 . Fluorophore localizations were determined and rendered into super - resolution images using the Nanoimager software ( version 1 . 10 . 0 . 11025 ) from Oxford Nanoimaging . Data analyses Quanti \ufb01 cation of PREM images . The shape of CCSs in most cases was obvious in 2D PREM images . In uncertain cases , the degree of CCS invagination was determined using images tilted at \u00b110 \u2013 20 degrees . Based on the degree of invagination , CCSs were classi \ufb01 ed into three categories : ( i ) \ufb02 at CCSswith noobviousinvagination ; ( ii ) dome - shaped CCSs that had a hemispherical or less invaginated shape with visible edges of the clathrin lattice ; and ( iii ) spherical CCSs that had a round shape with the clathrin lattice edges not visible in 2D projection ima - ges . Dome - shaped subdomains of \ufb02 at CCSs were quanti \ufb01 ed separately from the contiguous \ufb02 at CCSs . The CCS area in PREM images was measured using ImageJ software . Branched actin networks in PREM samples were identi \ufb01 ed by the presence of two or more of the following characteristics : the presence of at least several Y - shaped con \ufb01 gurations , short \ufb01 lament lengths , a wide range of \ufb01 lament orientations , and abundance of actin \ufb01 lament ends . CCSs were considered to be actin - positive , if branched actin Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 33852 - 2 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 6127 16 networks were located no farther than 20 nm from the edge of the clathrin lattice . Cumulative area of actin \ufb01 laments overlapping with clathrin lattice in 2D projection PREM images were measured using ImageJ and expressed as a fraction of the CCS area . Quanti \ufb01 cation of TIRF microscopy images . The CCS area in TIRF microscopy images of RFP - CLC in U2OS and HeLa cells or clathrin immunostaining in PtK2 cells was quanti \ufb01 ed using ImageJ software after applying Gaussian blur ( 1 pixel ) , subtracting background with rolling ball radius of 5 pixels , automatic optimization of brightness and contrast and thresholding using Yen algorithm . Automatically selected regions of interest ( ROIs ) were manually corrected by separating fused ROIs if they were connected by a one - pixel bridge . Two PtK2 cells treated with CK - 666 , in which this procedure pro - duced an ROI covering nearly the entire cell , were excluded from quanti \ufb01 cation . For epsin knockout MEFs , thresholding was done using Auto Local Threshold with Bernsen radius = 5 and parameter 1 = 20 after \ufb01 le conversion to 8 bits without subsequent manual correction of ROIs . For quanti \ufb01 cation of CCS dynamics , cells were imaged by TIRF time - lapse microscopy for 10min with 2 or 3s intervals . Kymographs were generated using the Reslice tool in ImageJ along 15 parallel lines separated by 5 \u03bc m and covering the entire \ufb01 eld of view . After back - ground subtraction with 5 - pixel rolling ball radius , the lengths of individual traces were measured in ImageJ . Quanti \ufb01 cation of EGFP - epsin1 colocalization with mCherry - CLC and EGFP - epsin1 intensity at mCherry - CLC - positive structures in PtK2 cells was performed using ComDet v . 0 . 5 . 4 plugin for ImageJ ( https : / / github . com / ekatrukha / ComDet ) using approximate particle size of 4 pixels with options \u201c include larger particles \u201d and \u201c segment larger particle \u201d selected . The intensity threshold ( in SD ) was chosen for individual images to ensure proper particle selection . Quanti \ufb01 cation of STORM data . The two channels of the measured STORM images were drift corrected and then aligned using \ufb01 ducial markers that were included in the sample . The drift correction was performed using the built - in algorithm of the ONI microscope , and channel alignment was done using a combination of the built - in algorithm of the ONI microscope ( for a coarse alignment ) and a homemade MATLAB script ( for a \ufb01 ne alignment ) . In this MATLAB script , 50 \ufb01 ducials were automatically detected ( threshold based ) and \ufb01 tted using a 2D Gaussian pro \ufb01 le . The coordinates obtained for each \ufb01 ducialmarkerinthetwochannelswerethen comparedandthe entire image was corrected using the average shift values of these 50 \ufb01 ducial markers . After drift correction and channel alignment , the STORM images for each channel were clustered using a Voronoi Tessellation Analysis , inwhichaVoronoiclusterisacollectionofVoronoipolygonsforwhich the areas are smaller than a user - de \ufb01 ned threshold . The clusters were then visually inspected to con \ufb01 rm that an appropriate segmentation was obtained . The same threshold was used in all images for con - sistency but was independently determined for each of the channels . The threshold used for clathrin was 0 . 05 ( chosen as such that the individual clathrin coated pits are segmented as distinct clusters ) and 2 . 0 for actin ( this maintains most of the actin localizations within a single cluster ) . After clustering , several rectangular regions of interest ( ROI ) not containing \ufb01 ducial markers or stress \ufb01 bers in the F - actin channel were selected in order not to bias the localization analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , left - most panel ) . In each ROI , a local area around each clathrin cluster was selected by making a polygon of the clathrin cluster and expanding it symmetrically by 1 pixel , which wasequalto117 nm ( SupplementaryFig . 5a , panel1 ) . Onlytheactinand clathrin localizations in these local areas were considered for the co - localization analysis that was performed with home - made algorithms in MATLAB ( see Supplementary Fig . 5a for work \ufb02 ow ) , resulting in two numbers per ROI : the percentage of actin localizations that is co - localized with clathrin coated pits ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , overlap zone in panel 3 ) , and the percentage of non - colocalized actin locali - zations ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , yellow shape in panel 5 ) . To calculate densitiesofactinlocalizationswithinand outsideofclathrinclustersin the expanded regions ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , panel 1 , gray zone ) , the clathrin cluster area was determined by making a polygon from the clathrin cluster ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , panel 3 , red ) , while the actin area outside the clathrin cluster was determined by making a polygon around the actin cluster within the expanded zone ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , panel 3 , cyan ) , calculating the joint polygon between the cla - thrin and actin polygons ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , panel 4 , green ) , and subtracting the clathrin polygon from this joint polygon ( Supple - mentary Fig . 5a , panel 5 , yellow ) . The colocalized and non - colocalized actin localization densities were determined by normalizing the total number of actin localizations within respective zones in a given ROI to the total area of these zones . This automatic procedure averages the actin localization densities among actin - positive and actin - negative clathrin clusters and therefore underestimates the difference between on - clusters versus off - clusters actin localization densities for actin - positive clathrin clusters . Statistics and reproducibility . At least two independent experiments of each type have been done and produced consistent results . Speci - \ufb01 cally , the experiments shown in the following \ufb01 gures were repeated three times : main Fig . 1 ( U2OS cells ) , 2 ( a - m ) , 2 ( U2OS cells in panels n and o ) , 4d ( HeLa cells ) , and 7 ( a - f ) and Supplementary Figs . 1 and 4 ( f - h , U2OS cells ) . All other experiments were repeated twice . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 . 0 . 0 . software . Numerical data sets were \ufb01 rst evaluated for normality by Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . For the normally distributed values , two - tailed t - test was used to compare two data sets and Welch \u2019 s ANOVA test with posthoc Games - Howell test was used for multiple comparisons . For not nor - mally distributed values , two - tailed Mann - Whitney test was used to compare two unpaired data sets , Wilcoxon test was used to compare two paired data sets , and Kruskal - Wallis with posthoc Dunn \u2019 s test was used for multiple comparisons .

  "yamada2016actin": "INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 877 - 886 , 2016 Abstract . The endocytic protein dynamin participates in the formation of actin - based membrane protrusions such as podosomes , pseudopodia , and invadopodia , which facilitate cancer cell migration , invasion , and metastasis . However , the role of dynamin in the formation of actin - based membrane protrusions at the leading edge of cancer cells is unclear . In this study , we demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed dynamin 2 isoform facilitates cell migration by stabilizing F - actin bundles in filopodia of the lung cancer cell line H1299 . Pharmacological inhibition of dynamin 2 decreased cell migration and filopodial formation . Furthermore , dynamin 2 and cortactin mostly colocalized along F - actin bundles in filopodia of serum - stimulated H1299 cells by immuno - fluorescent and immunoelectron microscopy . Knockdown of dynamin 2 or cortactin inhibited the formation of filopodia in serum - stimulated H1299 cells , concomitant with a loss of F - actin bundles . Expression of wild - type cortactin rescued the punctate - like localization of dynamin 2 and filopodial forma - tion . The incubation of dynamin 2 and cortactin with F - actin induced the formation of long and thick actin bundles , with these proteins colocalizing at F - actin bundles . A depolymer - ization assay revealed that dynamin 2 and cortactin increased the stability of F - actin bundles . These results indicate that dynamin 2 and cortactin participate in cell migration by stabilizing F - actin bundles in filopodia . Taken together , these findings suggest that dynamin might be a possible molecular target for anticancer therapy . Introduction Cancer cell migration , invasion , and metastasis are preceded by the formation of pseudopodia such as lamellipodia and filopodia . During these cellular processes , F - actin filaments remodel into a higher order structure and then assemble an intricate cytoskeletal network within cells ( 1 ) . These dynamic three - dimensional changes are mediated by several actin - bundling and crosslinking proteins , and are essential for supporting filopodia at the leading edge of migrating cells ( 2 ) . Dynamin plays an essential role in endocytosis , partici - pating in the membrane fission process ( 3 - 5 ) . Dynamin also functions in the formation of actin - rich structures , including lamellipodia and dorsal membrane ruffles ( 6 , 7 ) , invadopodia ( 8 ) , podosomes ( 9 ) , growth cones ( 10 - 12 ) , and phagocytic cups ( 13 , 14 ) . Three dynamin isoforms exist , namely , dynamin 1 , 2 , and 3 ( 5 ) . Dynamins are characterized by a GTPase domain at the N - terminus , a bundle signaling element , a stalk domain , a phosphoinositide - binding pleckstrin homology domain , and a proline and arginine - rich domain at the C - terminus ( PRD ) ( 15 , 16 ) . The PRD interacts with different proteins that contain the Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domain . Of these GTPases , dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed . Cortactin , an F - actin - binding protein , was first identified as an Src substrate ( 17 ) . Cortactin also participates in cancer cell migration , invasion , and metastasis by regulating actin dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells ( 18 ) . Cortactin is composed of an N - terminal acidic domain and a six - and - a - half tandem repeats domain , which directly binds to F - actin . Cortactin also contains an \u03b1 - helix , a proline - rich region , and an SH3 domain at the C - terminus , which interacts with the PRD of several binding partners ( 19 ) . Both dynamin and cortactin are implicated in the dynamics of cancer cells , including migration , invasion , and metastasis ( 18 ) . In addition , the pharmacological inhibition of dynamin by GTPase inhibitors suppresses specific cellular processes such as the lamellipodial formation and invasion of human osteocarcinoma cells ( 20 ) and the growth of human prostate adenocarcinoma cells ( 21 ) . Actin bundling by dynamin 2 and cortactin is implicated in cell migration by stabilizing filopodia in human non - small cell lung carcinoma cells HIROSHI YAMADA 1 , 3 , TETSUYA TAKEDA 1 , 3 , HIROYUKI MICHIUE 2 , TADASHI ABE 1 , 3 and KOHJI TAKEI 1 , 3 Departments of 1 Neuroscience and 2 Physiology , Graduate School of Medicine , Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences , Okayama University ; 3 CREST , Japan Science and Technology Agency , Kita - ku , Okayama 700 - 8558 , Japan Received April 6 , 2016 ; Accepted May 25 , 2016 DOI : 10 . 3892 / ijo . 2016 . 3592 Correspondence to : Dr Hiroshi Yamada , Department of Neuro - science , Graduate School of Medicine , Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences , Okayama University , 2 - 5 - 1 Shikata - cho , Kita - ku , Okayama 700 - 8558 , Japan E - mail : hiroyama @ md . okayama - u . ac . jp Key words : actin , cortactin , dynamin , filopodia , migration YAMADA et al : ACTIN BUNDLING BY DYNAMIN AND CORTACTIN IN CANCER CELL MIGRATION 878 A previous study reported that dynamin 2 binds to cortactin ( 7 , 12 ) . A disruption of this protein complex can affect the shape of cancer cells ( 7 ) , organization of the F - actin network within these cells ( 22 ) , and structure of growth cones ( 11 , 12 ) . However , the role of the dynamin 2 - cortactin complex in the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in cancer cells is unclear . In this study , we investigated whether dynamin 2 and cortactin regulate the F - actin bundle formation in filopodia in the human non - small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 . Materials and methods Antibodies and reagents . Rabbit polyclonal anti - dynamin 1 ( cat . no . PA1 - 660 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) and anti - c - myc ( cat . no .

The human non - small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 ( Cat . no . ATCC CRL - 5803 ; American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA , USA ) was cultured in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37\u02daC in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Expression and purification of dynamin 2 and cortactin wild - types and mutants . GFP - tagged dynamin 2 cloned into pEGFP - N1 was a kind gift from Dr Mark McNiven ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA ) ( 6 ) . His - tagged dynamin 2 produced with the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was a kind gift from Dr Hiroshi Handa ( Tokyo Institute of Technology , Tokyo , Japan ) ( 23 ) . The dynamin solution was concentrated using a Centriplus YM50 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and stored at - 80\u02daC . The protein suspension ( 2 - 5 mg / ml protein ) was thawed at 37\u02daC before use . The cDNAs encoding full - length rat cortactin and its mutants were prepared by polymerase chain reaction ampli - fication using specific primers ( 12 ) . Full - length cortactin or 1 - 450aa ( Cort \u2206 SH3 ) was subcloned into the plasmid pGEX - 6p vector as Bam HI - Eco RI fragments . GST - tagged cortactin W525K was generated by mutating pGEX - 6p - cortactin with the QuickChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . For expression in cells , full - length cortactin or Cort \u2206 SH3 was subcloned into the pEF1 myc - His vector ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) as Eco RI - Xba I fragments . The nucleotide sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis . The resulting plasmid was transformed into the bacterial BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS strain for protein expression . The expression of GST - fusion proteins was induced by 0 . 1 mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - d - galactopyranoside at 37\u02daC for 3 - 6 h in LB medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g / ml ampicillin to A 600 = 0 . 8 . The purification of GST - fusion proteins was performed as previously described ( 24 ) , and the cleavage of the GST with PreScission protease was performed according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . The protein was purified on a MonoQ column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris - HCl and 0 . 2 M NaCl , pH 7 . 7 . The eluted protein fraction ( 1 mg / ml protein ) was stored at - 80\u02daC . For the pull - down assay , the proteins were used without cleaving GST . siRNA - mediated interference . Pre - annealed siRNAs for human dynamin 2 and cortactin , and the negative control siRNA , were synthesized and purified ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The sequences for the siRNAs for human dynamin 2 were as follows : 5 ' - GGAUAUUGAGGGCAAGAAGtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , 5 ' - CUUCUUGCCCUCAAUAUCCtt - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 1 ; 5 ' - GCGAAUCGUCACCACUUACtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , 5 ' - GUAAGUG GUGACGAUUCGCtc - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 2 ; and 5 ' - GGAC UUACGACGGGAGAUCtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , 5 ' - GAUCUCCCGU CGUAAGUCCtt - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 3 . The sequences for the siRNAs for human cortactin were as follows : CCGAAUG GAUAAGUCAGUCtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , 5 ' - AGCUGACUUAUCCAU UCGGtc - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 1 ; GGUUUCGGCGGCA AAUACGtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , CGUAUUUGCCGCCGAAACCtt - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 2 ; and CGAAUAUCAGUCGAAACUUtt - 3 ' ( sense ) , AAGUUUCGACUGAUAUUCGtg - 3 ' ( antisense ) for oligo 3 . A scrambled siRNA with no significant sequence homology to all mouse , rat , or human gene sequences was used as the negative control . The day before transfection , the cells were plated in 6 - well plates ( 5x10 4 cells / well ) . One hundred picomoles of the duplex siRNAs was transfected into the cells using 4 \u00b5l of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . After 72 h , the cells were treated differently according to experimental design . In pilot experiments , we confirmed that all three transfections of siRNA for dynamin 2 and cortactin were effective . Filopodial formation . H1299 cells were serum - starved for 16 h . Thereafter , the cells were transfected with dynamin 2 siRNAs , cortactin siRNAs , or the control siRNA , followed by incubation with DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS for 45 min . For the rescue experiments , cortactin was silenced in H1299 cells with oligo 3 , and the cells were cultured for 24 h . The cells ( 1x10 5 / coverslip ) were then transfected with rat wild - type cortactin or cortactin W525K ( 0 . 25 \u00b5g each ) cloned into the pIRES2 - AcGFP1 expression vector ( Clontech Laboratories , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Thereafter , the cells were stimulated with serum for 45 min , fixed , and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 or rhodamine - labeled phalloidin for visualization of filopodia . Wound healing assay . H1299 cells were cultured to confluence on glass - bottom dishes ( 35 mm diameter ; AGC Techno Glass Co . Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) in DMEM supplemented with 0 . 2 % FBS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 877 - 886 , 2016 879 for 8 h . Thereafter , the cell layer was wounded with a plastic pipette tip as previously described ( 25 ) . The cells were washed with DMEM supplemented with 0 . 2 % FBS and incubated for 8 h in the presence of Dynasore , Dynole 34 - 2 or MitMAB at the indicated concentrations . For the negative control , cells were incubated with 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . The cells were visualized by Giemsa staining , followed by the acquisi - tion of phase contrast images from \u226520 randomly selected areas per dish . Areas filled with migrating cells were analyzed with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Formation of in vitro F - actin bundles . For the fluorescent detection of F - actin , non - muscle actin was polymerized in F - buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , and 0 . 5 mM ATP , pH 7 . 5 ) for 1 h . Thereafter , 3 . 3 \u00b5M F - actin was incubated with 5 \u00b5M dynamin 1 or 2 and cortactin for 1 h , followed by an additional 30 min with 3 \u00b5M Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin . The samples were spread onto glass slides and mounted , and the F - actin bundles were observed under an epifluorescent microscope . For the immunolocalization of dynamin and cortactin , F - actin bundles were incubated with dynamin 1 or 2 and cortactin for 30 min with 3 \u00b5M phalloidin to stabilize the filaments , followed by centrifugation at 5 , 000 x g for 10 min . The pellet was resuspended with 50 \u00b5l of F - buffer and then immunostained in suspension for 30 min with 1 \u00b5l of primary antibody . The mixture was centrifuged at 5 , 000 x g , and the pellet was washed with F - buffer . The samples were incubated with secondary antibodies and washed as previously done for the primary antibody . All steps were performed at room temperature . The samples were spread onto glass slides and mounted . The samples were examined under a spinning disc confocal microscope system ( CSU10 , Yokogawa Electric Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) combined with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 , Olympus Optical Co . , Ltd . , Tokyo , Japan ) and a CoolSNAP - HQ camera ( Roper Technologies , Sarasota , FL , USA ) . The confocal system was controlled by MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 or Illustrator CS3 software . Immunoprecipitation assay . For the immunoprecipitation assay , H1299 cells were co - transfected with GFP - tagged dynamin 2 and either myc - tagged cortactin or cortactin \u2206 SH3 . The cells were lysed with 1 % NP - 40 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 10 mM NaF , and 20 mM HEPES / KOH , pH 7 . 4 , and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) . The protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell extract using either 5 \u00b5g of the polyclonal anti - myc antibodies or preimmune IgG , and then visualized by western blotting with a monoclonal anti - GFP or anti - myc antibody . Immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy . H1299 cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained by immu - nofluorescence as previously described ( 12 ) . Transmission electron microscopy . Specimens were embedded for immunoelectron microscopy as previously described ( 12 ) . In brief , H1299 cells were fixed with cytoskeleton buffer ( 10 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 0 ) containing 10 \u00b5g / ml phalloidin , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 3 % formaldehyde for 1 min . The cells were then fixed for an additional 30 min without Triton X - 100 , followed by washing with 5 \u00b5g / ml phal - loidin in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . After incubation in blocking solution ( 10 \u00b5g / ml phalloidin , 2 mg / ml BSA , and 100 mM glycine in PBS ) , the specimens were incubated with a primary antibody diluted in blocking solution , washed with 5 \u00b5g / ml phalloidin in PBS , incubated with goat anti - mouse or rabbit anti - goat IgG conjugated to 10 - nm gold particles , and then fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 5 \u00b5g / ml phalloidin in PBS . The specimens were post - fixed with 1 % OsO 4 in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h , dehydrated , and embedded in EPON 812 for ultrathin sectioning . Cross - sections were visualized under a Hitachi H - 7100 transmission electron microscope . Determination of filopodial length . For the measurement of the filopodial length , H1299 cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine - or Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated phalloidin . Membrane protrusions supported with F - actin bundles were defined as filopodia , and digital images were acquired at 400 - 1 , 000x magnifications . Up to five filopodia for each cell were randomly selected , and their lengths were measured with ImageJ software . Statistical analysis . Data were analyzed for statistical significance using KaleidaGraph software ( version 4 . 1 ) for the Macintosh ( Synergy Software Inc . , Essex Junction , VT , USA ) . Analysis of variance and Tukey ' s honest significant difference post hoc test were applied for more than two different groups , and Student ' s t - test was applied for two different groups . P - values of < 0 . 05 and 0 . 001 were considered as statistically significant . Results Inhibition of dynamin decreases the migration of the human non - small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 . To determine whether dynamin 2 is involved in cell migration , the effects of dynamin inhibition on cell migration were determined by a wound healing assay . Cell migration decreased after treatment of cells with Dynasore ( 26 ) , Dynole 34 - 2 ( 27 ) , and MitMAB ( 28 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Dynasore ( 80 \u00b5M ) inhibited cell migration by ~ 80 % compared to that of control cells , whereas Dynole 34 - 2 and MitMAB inhibited cell migration by 20 - 40 % ( Fig . 1B ) . These results indicate that dynamin is important for the migra - tion of H1299 cells . Dynamin 2 colocalizes with cortactin along F - actin bundles in filopodia of H1299 cells . Fig . 1 shows that dynamin is involved in cell migration mediated by pseudopodia . Thus , we investi - gated whether dynamin 2 participates in filopodial formation in H1299 cells . Because cortactin functions with dynamin 1 in the bundling of F - actin , which is important for the stability of filopodia in human neuroblastoma cell line SH - SY5Y ( 12 ) , dynamin 2 and cortactin were immunostained in serum - stimu - lated H1299 cells . H1299 cells formed numerous filopodia YAMADA et al : ACTIN BUNDLING BY DYNAMIN AND CORTACTIN IN CANCER CELL MIGRATION 880 after serum stimulation ( Fig . 2A ) . Furthermore , dynamin 2 and cortactin colocalized to F - actin bundles in filopodia as bright dots ( Fig . 2A ) . The negative controls showed little immunoreactivity for dynamin 2 and cortactin ( Fig . 2B ) . In addition , immunoelectron microscopy revealed that both proteins localized to F - actin bundles in filopodia ( Fig . 2C ) . These results prompted us to examine the possible inter - action of dynamin 2 and cortactin by immunoprecipitation . Exogenously expressed dynamin 2 - GFP was co - precipitated with full - length cortactin - myc using a polyclonal anti - myc anti - bodies and H1299 cell lysates ( Fig . 2D , left ) . Cort \u2206 SH3 - myc , a dynamin 2 binding deficient mutant that lacks its SH3 domain , was unable to precipitate dynamin 2 ( Fig . 2D , right ) . Taken together , these results illustrate that these proteins interact at F - actin bundles in filopodia of H1299 cells . Dynamin 2 and cortactin are required for serum - induced filopodial formation in H1299 cells . To examine the role of dynamin 2 in filopodial formation , dynamin 2 was silenced in H1299 cells by RNAi . Compared with the control , knockdown of dynamin 2 in H1299 cells with specific siRNAs reduced its level by ~ 95 % as revealed by western blotting ( Fig . 3A ) . Compared with the length of filopodia in serum - stimulated control cells ( 10 . 2\u00b10 . 5 \u00b5m ) , dynamin 2 knockdown decreased filopodial extension in silenced cells ( 4 . 7\u00b10 . 6 \u00b5m ) ( Fig . 3B and C ) . In addition , dynasore inhibited filopodial extension ( 2 . 4\u00b10 . 08 \u00b5m ) . This effect was rescued after the inhibitor was removed ( 8 . 1\u00b12 . 4 \u00b5m ) ( Fig . 3D and E ) . We also examined the effects of cortactin knockdown by RNAi on filopodial formation . Compared with the control , knockdown of cortactin reduced its level by ~ 95 % as revealed by western blotting ( Fig . 4A ) . Compared with the length of filopodia in control cells ( 10 . 2\u00b10 . 39 \u00b5m ) , cortactin knockdown also decreased filopodial extension after serum - stimulation ( 5 . 6\u00b10 . 17 \u00b5m ) ( Fig . 4B and C ) . The inhibition of filopodial formation in cortactin - silenced cells was rescued by exogenous expression of wild - type cortactin ( 10 . 8\u00b10 . 54 \u00b5m ) but not by cortactin W525K , a binding - defective mutant of dynamin 2 ( 29 ) ( Fig . 4D and E ) . In addition , the punctate - like localization of dynamin 2 along F - actin bundles reappeared in wild - type cortactin expressing cells ( Fig . 4F , right ) . These results indi - cate that dynamin 2 and cortactin are required for filopodial formation . F - actin bundling by the dynamin 2 - cortactin complex stabi - lizes F - actin . The effects of dynamin 2 and cortactin on the formation of F - actin bundles were examined in vitro . In this experiment , preformed F - actin were incubated with or without cortactin and dynamin 2 in the presence of GTP . F - actin alone appeared as uniform filaments ( Fig . 5A , actin alone ) . The addition of dynamin 2 to F - actin filaments did not cause any visible change in their distribution ( Fig . 5A , + Dyn2 ) . However , F - actin incubated with wild - type cortactin , cortactin W525K or cortactin \u2206 SH3 often formed small clusters ( Fig . 5A , + Cort WT , + Cort W525K , or + Cort \u2206 SH3 ) , consistent with a previ - ously published report ( 12 ) . The presence of both dynamin 2 Figure 1 . Dynamin GTPase inhibitors inhibit the migration of H1299 cells . ( A ) Representative images acquired by light microscopy showing cell migration in a wound healing assay .

For the negative control ( control 0 h ) , cells were incubated with 1 % DMSO . Scale bar , 200 \u00b5m . ( B ) Morphometric analysis of the wound area filled by migrating cells after treatment with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations . The changes were normalized to the control . Results represent the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 877 - 886 , 2016 881 and wild - type cortactin resulted in the formation of long and thick F - actin bundles ( Fig . 5A , + Dyn2 + Cort WT ) , which were similar to those formed by dynamin 1 and cortactin ( Fig . 5A , + Dyn1 + Cort WT ) . On the other hand , the long and thick F - actin bundles were much less evident in the presence of dynamin 2 and cortactin W525K or \u2206 SH3 ( Fig . 5A , + Dyn2 + Cort W525K or + Dyn2 + Cort \u2206 SH3 ) . To localize dynamin 2 and cortactin to F - actin bundles , the preformed F - actin bundles were used for immunofluores - cent staining . Dynamin 2 and cortactin colocalized as bright dots along F - actin bundles ( Fig . 5B , left ) . The localiza - tion of dynamin 2 and cortactin was similar to that of the dynamin 1 - cortactin complex ( Fig . 5B , right ) ( 12 ) . Lastly , we examined whether actin bundling by the dynamin 2 - cortactin complex can affect F - actin stability . To address this , the depolymerization kinetics of preformed pyrene - labeled F - actin were examined after the solution was diluted 10 - fold with buffer . In the presence of dynamin 2 and cortactin , the rate of depolymerization by dilution decreased to a level comparable to that induced by \u03b1 - actinin , an actin - crosslinking protein , indicating that dynamin 2 and cortactin stabilize F - actin bundles ( Fig . 5C ) . These results indicate that the dynamin 2 - cortactin complex stabilizes F - actin bundles in filopodia prior to cell migration . Discussion The involvement of dynamin in the dynamics of cancer cells such as cell migration , invasion , and metastasis has been reported ( 18 ) . However , the precise role of dynamin in these Figure 2 . Dynamin 2 colocalizes with cortactin along F - actin bundles in filopodia of serum - stimulated H1299 cells .

The protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti - myc antibody or preimmune IgG ( IgG ) , and then visualized by western blotting ( WB ) with monoclonal anti - GFP or anti - myc antibodies . Total cell lysates ( 4 , 10 and 20 \u00b5g ) were also analyzed ( input ) . YAMADA et al : ACTIN BUNDLING BY DYNAMIN AND CORTACTIN IN CANCER CELL MIGRATION 882 cellular processes is not entirely clear . We recently reported that actin bundling by the dynamin 1 - cortactin complex is crucial for neurite extension in developing neurons ( 12 ) . In this study , we examined the possibility that a similar F - actin - bundling mechanism is involved in the migration of H1299 cells , a human non - small cell lung carcinoma cell line . We showed that cortactin and dynamin 2 mostly colocal - ized along F - actin bundles in filopodia of serum - stimulated H1299 cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Pharmacological inhibition of dynamin 2 by Dynasore , Dynole 34 - 2 or MitMAB decreased cell migra - tion ( Fig . 1 ) and filopodial formation ( Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , filopodia were shorter in dynamin 2 - and cortactin - depleted cells than in control cells ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . In cortactin - silenced cells , the exogenous expression of wild - type cortactin rescued the punctate - like localization of dynamin 2 and filopodial formation ( Fig . 4 ) . Both dynamin 2 and cortactin bundled Figure 3 . Knockdown of dynamin 2 decreases filopodial formation in H1299 cells .

YAMADA et al : ACTIN BUNDLING BY DYNAMIN AND CORTACTIN IN CANCER CELL MIGRATION 884 F - actin , and these proteins increased F - actin stability ( Fig . 5 ) . These results indicate that dynamin 2 and cortactin partici - pate in cancer cell migration by stabilizing F - actin bundles in filopodia . Dynamin assembles at the neck of deeply invaginated endocytic pits ( 30 ) . Upon GTP hydrolysis , however , dynamin undergoes a conformational change , resulting in the fission of endocytic pits and release of endocytic vesicles ( 31 - 33 ) . In addition , dynamin 1 forms a ring - like complex with cortactin , which switches from an open to a closed state upon GTP hydrolysis . This change promotes the bundling of F - actin filaments ( 12 ) . The mechanism of actin bundling mediated by the dynamin 2 - cortactin complex is similar to that of the dynamin 1 - cortactin complex , because dynamin 2 and cortactin also facilitated the formation of long and thick F - actin bundles to which they colocalized ( Fig . 5 ) . This mechanochemical Figure 5 . Actin bundling by dynamin 2 and cortactin stabilizes F - actin bundles . ( A ) Long F - actin bundles were formed in the presence of dynamin 2 and cortactin ( lower left ) . Preformed F - actin ( 3 . 3 \u00b5M ) was incubated with or without the indicated proteins ( 5 \u00b5M each ) . F - actin was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin . Scale bar , 30 \u00b5m . ( B ) Representative images acquired by fluorescent microscopy showing the localization of dynamin and cortactin along F - actin bundles . Actin bundles were formed in vitro by incubating dynamin 2 with wild - type cortactin ( left ) or dynamin 1 and wild - type cortactin ( right ) . Protein colocalization was performed by double - immunofluorescence . Scale bar , 2 \u00b5m . ( C ) Kinetics of F - actin disassembly induced in 10 - fold diluted preformed pyrene - labeled F - actin solution with buffer . F - actin bundles disassembled in the presence of dynamin 2 and cortactin , as well as in the presence of 5 \u00b5M \u03b1 - actinin . The rate of F - actin bundle disassembly was measured by pyrene - fluorescence . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 877 - 886 , 2016 885 property may be critical for the formation of F - actin bundles in filopodia of other cell types as well ( Fig . 6 ) . Additional studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism . Dynamin associates with tumorigenesis , particularly tumor cell migration and invasion . For example , increased dynamin 2 expression potentiates the migration and invasion of pancreatic ductal cancer cells ( 25 ) , and tyrosine phosphorylated dynamin 2 promotes the growth and invasiveness of glioblastomas ( 34 ) . Thus , the involvement of dynamin in the formation of F - actin bundles might promote cancer malignancy . In conclusion , we showed that dynamin 2 and cortactin participate in the formation of F - actin bundles , which stabi - lize filopodia in migrating cancer cells . Taken together , these results suggest that dynamin might be a potential molecular target for anticancer therapy .

Holst 1 , Maite Vidal - Quadras 1 , Sara Henriksson 2 , 3 , Rachel Santarella - Mellwig 4 , Linda Sandblad 3 and Richard Lundmark 1 , 2 , * ABSTRACT Changes in cell morphology require coordination of plasma membrane turnover and cytoskeleton dynamics , processes that are regulated by Rho GTPases . Here , we describe how a direct interaction between the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and the GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) GRAF1 ( also known as ARHGAP26 ) , facilitates rapid cell surface turnover at the leading edge . Both Cdc42 and GRAF1 were required for fluid - phase uptake and regulated the generation of transient GRAF1 - coated endocytic carriers , which were distinct from clathrin - coated vesicles . GRAF1 was found to transiently assemble at discrete Cdc42 - enriched punctae at the plasma membrane , resulting in a corresponding decrease in the microdomain association of Cdc42 . However , Cdc42 captured in its active state was , through a GAP - domain - mediated interaction , localised together with GRAF1 on accumulated internal structures derived from the cell surface . Correlative fluorescence and electron tomography microscopy revealed that these structures were clusters of small membrane carriers with defective endosomal processing . We conclude that a transient interaction between Cdc42 and GRAF1 drives endocytic turnover and controls the transition essential for endosomal maturation of plasma membrane internalised by this mechanism . KEY WORDS : Clathrin - independent endocytosis , GRAF1 , Cdc42 , Cell surface , Actin INTRODUCTION Cell surface dynamics are fundamental to a variety of basic biological processes , such as migration , polarisation and division , as well as protein and lipid trafficking . Intimate coupling to an underlying meshwork of cortical actin keeps the plasma membrane under high tension , providing the cell surface with its vital strength to withstand mechanical stress ( Gauthier et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , structural alterations of the cell surface can only be achieved through the intricate coordination of membrane remodelling events and cytoskeletal rearrangements ( de Curtis and Meldolesi , 2012 ) . Small G - proteins of the Rho GTPase family are known as master regulators of the cytoskeleton and have been shown to greatly influence membrane tension and plasma membrane turnover by regulating endocytic and exocytic events ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ; Ridley , 2001 ) . Rho GTPases are peripherally attached to the membrane through lipid modifications and are active in their GTP - loaded state , where they interact with various effector molecules and function as molecular switches through rounds of GTP hydrolysis . The activity , which is stimulated by external cues , is strictly regulated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) , which promote GTP hydrolysis and facilitate loading of GTP , respectively ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) . However , the intricate mechanisms that allow for a cyclical nucleotide exchange in small G - proteins to synchronise membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics are still not understood . The clathrin - independent carrier ( CLIC ) pathway , a major pinocytic endocytic route in fibroblasts , facilitates polarised and rapid uptake of fluid , bacterial toxins , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - linked receptors and receptors involved in cell adhesion ( Howes et al . , 2010a ) . CLICs were originally defined by their dependence on the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and tubular morphology , separating them from clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolae ( Hansen and Nichols , 2009 ; Howes et al . , 2010b ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . Carriers derived from this pathway have been shown to fuse into GPI - enriched endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) , which subsequently merge with early endosomes or recycling endosomes ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) . The formation of CLICs depends on a poorly characterised molecular system , involving the small G - proteins Cdc42 and Arf1 , and their regulatory proteins ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . Although CLICs account for a major portion of the endocytic turnover of the plasma membrane , very little mechanistic detail is available regarding their formation . It has previously been shown that GRAF1 ( also known as ARHGAP26 ) , a GAP active against Cdc42 ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ; Jelen et al . , 2009 ; Longenecker et al . , 2000 ) , is essential for CLIC uptake ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . GRAF1 is a dimeric multidomain protein composed of Bin , amphiphysin , RVS161 / 167 ( BAR ) , pleckstrin homology ( PH ) , GAP and Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . The BAR and PH domains can generate and / or stabilise highly curved endocytic membranes from phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) - enriched regions , whereas the C - terminal GAP and SH3 domains modulates Cdc42 activity and interacts with regulatory proteins , respectively ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ; Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Okada et al . , 2011 ) . Loss of GRAF1 downregulates endocytosis and affects cellular processes such as cortical actin remodelling , integrin trafficking , adhesion , spreading , migration and fusion , suggesting that this protein is an important regulator of cell surface dynamics ( Doherty et al . , 2011a , b ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Nonnenmacher and Weber , 2011 ; Simpson et al . , 2008 ; Stergiou et al . , 2013 ) . In this work , we studied the interplay between GRAF1 and Cdc42 to decipher its importance for coordination of membrane and Received 13 May 2015 ; Accepted 28 September 2015 1 Integrative Medical Biology , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 2 Medical Biochemistryand Biophysics , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 3 Molecular Biology , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 4 European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Meyerhofstr . 1 , Heidelberg 69117 , Germany . * Author for correspondence ( richard . lundmark @ umu . se ) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 3 . 0 ) , which permits unrestricted use , distributionandreproductioninanymediumprovidedthattheoriginalworkisproperlyattributed . 4183 \u00a9 2015 .

We characterise GRAF1 as a molecular marker of CLICs and demonstrate how this protein , through a direct interaction , regulates Cdc42 activity during endocytosis . This study also defines a temporal and spatial restriction of active Cdc42 as a prerequisite for the internalisation and further trafficking of cell surface components . RESULTS Correlative light and electron microscopy reveals highly curved membrane carriers decorated by GRAF1 and GTPase - deficient Cdc42 Consistent with the proposed involvement of the GTPase Cdc42 and the GAP GRAF1 in the generation of CLICs , GRAF1 localised with a dominant - active form of Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - Q61L , which is deficient in GTP hydrolysis ) to discrete assemblies in fixed cells ( Fig . 1A ) . As a step towards determining their identity , correlative light and electron tomography microscopy ( CLEM ) was used to resolve the ultrastructure of these assemblies . High - pressure frozen cells transfected with GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L were further prepared for CLEM as described in the Materials and Methods ( Kukulski et al . , 2011 ; Nixon et al . , 2009 ) . By overlaying the captured epifluorescence micrograph with high - resolution electron tomograms acquired from the same sample and region of interest ( ROI ) , it was apparent that all the fluorescent spots containing both proteins overlapped with small membranous structures ( Fig . 1B ) . Cdc42 - Q61L fluorescence alone , commonly seen lining the cell edge , was instead associated with the plasma membrane . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) models of the membranous structures , reconstructed from the tomograms , revealed that the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - positive structures detected by epifluorescence microscopy actually corresponded to tightly packed clusters of membrane carriers ( Fig . 1B ) . Most of the carriers were separated from the plasma membrane , but examples of tubular structures connected to the cell surface were also found ( Fig . 1B ) . Although they were quite morphologically diverse , the modelled carriers could roughly be divided into being either disc - like or tube - like on the basis of their shape ( Fig . 1C ; compare to the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - negative clathrin - coated vesicle ) . The measurement of the minor axis of each structure further indicated a surprisingly conserved diameter , spanning 20 \u2013 60 nm in 97 % of the carriers ( Fig . 1D ) . The close proximity of the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - positive carriers to the basal cell surface , evident using confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) , was further confirmed by the reconstructed 3D models . The carrier clusters were detected within 500 nm of the basal membrane , and their distance to the cell edge , as measured in the x - y plane , ranged between 360 and 2200 nm . Taken together , the information collected from light and electron microscopy shows that GRAF1 and GTPase - deficient Cdc42 localise to carriers formed near the cell surface that have a morphology consistent with the membrane compartments previously defined as CLICs . GRAF1 is a marker of CLICs that are rapidly forming at the leading edge of cells To enable the dissection of a potential molecular interplay between Cdc42 and GRAF1 during CLIC formation , a cell model system was established utilising GRAF1 as a pathway marker . In a Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell line , untagged or GFP - tagged GRAF1 was placed under the control of a tet promoter modulated by doxycycline , resulting in an inducible system for the expression of a controlled amount of protein ( Fig . 2A ) . The protein expression level adapted for all subsequent experiments was chosen as to enable the detection of fluorescently tagged GRAF1 by microscopy , inevitably resulting in protein levels above the comparatively low endogenous level in this specific HeLa cell line . However , in contrast to using transient overexpression of GRAF1 , the developed Flp - In T - REx cell lines importantly allowed more reproducible and homogenous protein levels within the cultures ( Fig . S1A ) . In fixed cells , confocal microscopy showed that GRAF1 , independent of the presence of a fluorescent tag , assembled into punctate and , much less frequently , tubular structures at the cell surface ( Fig . S1B ) . In agreement with previous results detecting endogenous and transiently expressed GRAF1 in HeLa cells ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , these assemblies colocalised with a fraction of the promiscuous cargo cholera toxin B - subunit ( CTxB ) , as assayed after 2 min internalisation at 37\u00b0C ( Fig . S2A ) . Moreover , these assemblies were only on very rare occasions found to overlap with clathrin - associated markers like transferrin ( Tfn ) and AP - 2 ( the adaptin for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) , or the early endosomal marker EEA1 ( Fig . S2A ) . Analysis by live - cell spinning disc confocal microscopy revealed the formation of abundant short - lived GRAF1 \u2013 GFP - positive punctae at the leading edge of cells ( Fig . 2B ; Movie 1 ) . Software was used to create tracks corresponding to each detected structure , and from these the duration time of each track was derived . The average lifetime ( track duration ) of the dynamic GRAF1 assemblies was thereby determined to be \u223c 10 s ( Fig . 2C ) , showing that the protein was transiently assembled at the leading edge . This is in agreement with GRAF1 being associated with CLICs , which are dynamically formed at the cell periphery during cell spreading and migration ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ; Howes et al . , 2010a ) . To determine whether GRAF1 assembled at the plasma membrane , cells were followed by live - cell total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Structure tracks were created from the acquisitions and the duration of each track was calculated . The lifetimes of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP and GFP \u2013 GRAF1 assemblies were comparable to that detected by spinning disc confocal microscopy , suggesting that the burst in GRAF1 fluorescence corresponded to activity very near or at the cell surface ( Fig . 2D ; Fig . S1C ) . In agreement with this , detecting the surface binding and uptake of fluorescently tagged CTxB by performing live - cell TIRF microscopy revealed the recruitment of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 to CTxB clusters and the subsequent disappearance of both markers from the surface , indicative of endocytic carrier formation ( Fig . S2B ) . Importantly , in GRAF1 \u2013 GFP cells co - expressing mCherry - tagged clathrin light chain , live - cell TIRF microscopy followed by track analysis showed no overlap between the two proteins ( Fig . 2E ; Movie 2 ) , implying that GRAF1 does not aid the process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . It should be noted that GRAF1 assemblies were not exclusively observed at the leading edge of cells and that an increased fraction of the assemblies in the centre and rear of cells displayed duration times longer than 30 s ( Fig . S1D , E ) . LossofCdc42andactinpolymerisation impairGRAF1 carrier processing and the fluid - phase endocytic capacity Cdc42 was identified as a key regulator of CLIC - mediated endocytosis on the basis of the effects that overexpressed Cdc42 activity mutants exerted on the uptake through this pathway ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . To test the importance of Cdc42 and GRAF1 for clathrin - independent endocytosis in our established Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell lines , fluid - phase internalisation was quantified in cells depleted of either of these two proteins , or of AP - 2 by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . To control for effects on clathrin - mediated endocytosis , internalisation of transferrin was 4184 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e also assayed . The fluorescence of transferrin - S - S - CW800 or dextran - S - S - CW800 was measured after MesNa - reduction to remove surface - exposed fluorophores , and the internalisation was quantified in relation to that of cells transfected with control siRNA ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Although dextran uptake was impaired in all three samples , transferrin uptake was only significantly reduced in AP - 2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3A ) , verifying the importance of Cdc42 and GRAF1 in clathrin - independent endocytosis . The \u223c 50 % reduction of dextran uptake seen in all samples further indicated that clathrin - independent and - dependent pathways , under these conditions , contribute to roughly equal amounts of internalised fluid volume . To investigate the importance of Cdc42 function on GRAF1 - mediated carrier formation , the localisation and behaviour of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP was followed by live - cell spinning disc confocal microscopy in cells depleted of Cdc42 . Although GRAF1 in these cells could still be found in dynamic assemblies at the leading edge , there was a marked increase of GRAF1 - decorated tubular structures associated with the cell surface ( Fig . 3C ; Fig . S3A , B ) . This implies that GRAF1 in cells with a decreased available pool of Cdc42 can exert its sculpting and / or stabilising function on the plasma membrane , but in the absence of the GTPase that this activity is not properly regulated . Interestingly , active Cdc42 has been shown to be important for recruitment of the Wiskott \u2013 Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - dependent actin machinery to aid CLIC formation ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Similar to the effect seen after Cdc42 depletion , cells treated with the WASP - inhibitor wiskostatin showed a time - dependent increase of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - decorated tubes associated with the cell surface ( Fig . 3D , E ) . The same phenotype was also observed after treatment with the actin - depolymerising drugs latrunculin A and cytochalasin D ( Fig . S3C ) , previously shown to inhibit uptake through CLICs ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . The altered processing of GRAF1 - mediated carriers in Cdc42 - depleted cells is likely to be at least a contributing factor to their impaired endocytic capacity , and a result of dysregulated Cdc42 - dependent actin dynamics .

Remarkably , 94 % of the GRAF1 assemblies that transiently appeared at the leading edge overlapped with membrane - associated Cdc42 . Moreover , 88 % of these assemblies were recruited to existing microdomains enriched with the GTPase . Further dissection of the indicated interdependency between the two proteins was accomplished by detailed analysis of fluorescence intensity plots created for each detected structure and channel over time ( Fig . 4B ) . The lack of major lateral movements in the detected GRAF1 punctae allowed the intensity value calculations to be restricted to circular ROIs ( Fig . 4B ) . The peak range and maximum was determined for each structure and channel , as described in the Materials and Methods . An average GRAF1 assembly lifetime of 18 s was approximated on the basis of the determined peak ranges , which was slightly longer , but in the same range , as the \u223c 10 s calculated from the track durations ( Fig . 4C , compare to Fig . 2C ) . Quantification of the lifetime overlap between GRAF1 and Cdc42 assemblies averaged 99 % , consistent with the visual assessment above ( Fig . 4D ) . Interestingly , there was a clear trend of Cdc42 reaching the maximum intensity value before GRAF1 ( on average 5 s before the GRAF1 intensity maximum , and 3 s after the start of the GRAF1 peak ) ( Fig . 4E ) . Consistent with this , for 49 % of the analysed structures , it was evident that the Cdc42 intensity decreased as the GRAF1 intensity increased ( compared to 82 % when analysing the GRAF1 intensity decrease ) ( Fig . 4F ) . This suggests that GRAF1 somehow antagonises the existing cell surface enrichment of Cdc42 as it assembles on the membrane , likely by mediating its internalisation and / or transiently interacting with the GTPase to switch it off and thereby destabilising its association with the microdomain . An interaction between the GAP domain and transition state Cdc42 enforces membrane assembly of GRAF1 To investigate the impact of the Cdc42 activity state on GRAF1 membrane assembly , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 Flp - In T - REx HeLa cells co - expressing CoralHue - tagged dominant - negative ( nucleotide - binding deficient T17N ) , wild - type and dominant - active Cdc42 were analysed by confocal microscopy . In comparison to the other two samples , Cdc42 - Q61L - transfected cells showed a striking accumulation of GRAF1 in bright punctate and tubular Fig . 2 .

Moreover , this phenotype was dependent on the membrane localisation of the GTPase because it was abolished after introducing a point mutation of the cysteine residue ( C188A ) responsible for anchoring Cdc42 to the membrane ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Notably , no accumulation of GRAF1 structures was seen in cells co - expressing dominant - active RhoA - Q63L or Rac1 - Q61L ( Fig . 5A ) , two other GTPases within the same Rho family of actin regulators , confirming the specificity of the induced phenotype . In vitro pulldown experiments were used to determine whether the Cdc42 - Q61L mutation somehow influenced the otherwise inherently transient interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 , to thereby so profoundly affect GRAF1 membrane assembly . Using purified GST - tagged GRAF1 GAP domains as bait and Cdc42 or Cdc42 - Q61L loaded with GTP \u03b3 S ( a more stable GTP analogue ) as prey , revealed a preference in binding to the mutant ( Fig . 5C ) . However , repeating the assay with GDP - loaded GTPase in the presence of AlF x , to mimic the transition state conformation ( Mittal et al . , 1996 ) , resulted , in addition , to detectable binding to wild - type Cdc42 ( Fig . 5C ) . The Q61L mutation in Cdc42 increased the affinity to GRAF1 , likely by imposing an active site conformation , suggesting that the accumulation of GRAF1 assemblies in cells overexpressing this mutant is the effect of an enforced prolonged direct interaction . To test this hypothesis in vivo , HeLa cells transiently co - expressing CoralHue - tagged Cdc42 - Q61L and a GFP - tagged GAP domain containing or lacking truncates of GRAF1 , were analysed by confocal microscopy . Like full - length GRAF1 , the BAR - PH - GAP truncate showed an extensive accumulation in punctate and tubular structures together with the mutated GTPase ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Importantly , this effect was not seen with GFP \u2013 BAR - PH , confirming that it was dependent on the presence of the GAP domain . To avoid potential averse consequences of overexpressing truncated proteins , a Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell line was established with an inducible expression of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D , a point mutant disrupted in the so - called arginine finger known to be vital for the GAP activity ( Jelen et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . S3D , E ) . Co - expression of Cdc42 - Q61L in this cell line did not result in any accumulation of GRAF1 - R412D structures ( Fig . 5A ; Fig . S3G ) , verifying that the enforced GRAF1 membrane accumulation induced by GTPase - deficient Cdc42 is a consequence of a direct interaction between the two proteins . GTP hydrolysis deficiency traps Cdc42 together with GRAF1 on endocytic vesicles The confirmed interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 in vivo , begged the question as to whether GRAF1 - mediated inactivation of Cdc42 was important during endocytic carrier formation .

The cargo uptake was normalised to the corresponding control siRNA - transfected sample and the significance in relation to this sample was determined by analyses of at least three independent experiments ( mean\u00b1s . d . ; Mann \u2013 Whitney U tests , n = 3 \u2013 4 samples , \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ; ns , not significant ; * P < 0 . 05 ) .

Individual GRAF1 structures detected over the whole basal membrane were tracked over time in the acquisitions ( Fig . 6A ) and used to calculate the number of assemblies , their lifetime ( track duration ) , the distance between their appearance and disappearance ( track displacement ) , and the maximum speed of the structures ( Fig . 6B \u2013 E ) . Consistent with the results from fixed cells , co - expression of Cdc42 - Q61L resulted in four times more GRAF1 assemblies than detected in the other samples ( Fig . 6B ) . Notably , no clear difference in lifetime ( track duration ) of GRAF1 assemblies was found between Cdc42 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - expressing cells ( Fig . 6C ) , showing that the GRAF1 membrane accumulation enforced by Cdc42 - Q61L was not trapping the protein at the cell surface . However , the GRAF1 structures in cells co - expressing the GTPase - deficient mutant exhibited both an increased lateral mobility ( track displacement ) and a higher maximum speed ( Fig . 6D , E ) . Although the directional movement revealed by the track pattern of GRAF1 structures in Cdc42 - Q61L co - expressing cells ( Fig . 6A ) was unlikely to represent diffusion within the membrane , it could be explained by enforced GRAF1 assembly on intracellular vesicles trafficked along cytoskeletal tracks near the cell surface that are in close enough proximity to the plasma membrane to be detected within the TIRF field . To further explore the mobility of the GRAF1 assemblies enforced by co - expression of GTPase - hydrolysis - deficient Cdc42 , live - cell spinning disc microscopy was employed to increase the depth of the fluorescence probe detection in the focal plane of interest ( i . e . a plane close to , but just above , the basal membrane ) . In GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells co - expressing mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L , the proteins localised together both on budding carriers and intracellular laterally mobile vesicles ( Fig . 6F ; Movie 4 ) . The appearance of the latter type of structures in the TIRF and captured confocal fields indicates that carriers formed from the cell surface , positive for both proteins , later stay or reappear in a plane near the plasma membrane . From live - cell spinning disc microscopy acquisitions of cells co - expressing either wild - type Cdc42 or Cdc42 - Q61L , the detected structures of GRAF1 and respective GTPase protein were tracked and the time range of colocalisation was calculated . The colocalisation of GRAF1 and Cdc42 was significantly more transient than that of GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L ( Fig . 6G ) , suggesting that the prolonged interaction between GRAF1 and GTP - hydrolysis - deficient Cdc42 results in a longer co - existence of the proteins on internalised vesicles ( i . e . an entrapment of both proteins on budded vesicles ) .

Dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 was added to GFP \u2013 GRAF1 Flp - In T - REx HeLa cells co - expressing Myc \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L as a 5 - min pulse , then a quick wash was used to remove the excess extracellular marker and probes were followed by live - cell confocal microscopy . Immediately after the pulse , dextran was enriched in approximately one third of the accumulated GRAF1 structures ( Fig . 7A ) , verifying that these correspond to plasma - membrane - derived and budded endocytic carriers . The same protocol was used to prepare fixed samples for epifluorecence microscopy . Dextran could also be visualised in GRAF1 - positive carriers under fixed conditions ( Fig . 7B ) , but it should be noted that permeabilisation of fixed samples was avoided , given that the detection of this marker deteriorates with detergent treatment . Using software to define dextran compartments from the captured images , it was determined that the total uptake of fluid - phase was not significantly altered in cells affected by the Cdc42 - Q61L transfection ( Fig . 7C ) . Also in line with this , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D cells showed a higher prevalence of membrane assemblies in comparison to GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells ( Fig . S3H ) , without any detectable effect on dextran endocytosis ( Fig . 7E ; Fig . S3F ) , further verifying that the GRAF1 GAP activity against Cdc42 was not required for endocytic carrier formation . The entrapment of GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L on erratically behaving internalised vesicles , pointed towards a post - fission trafficking defect . Strikingly , in GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L co - Fig . 5 .

Furthermore , carriers decorated by GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L were never positive for EEA1 ( Fig . 7G ) , suggesting that these more likely represented a trapped intermediate membrane compartment . To explore this in more detail , dextran trafficking was captured in GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells co - expressing BFP \u2013 Rab5 alone , or together with Myc \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L , by live - cell spinningdiscmicroscopy . Cells were pulsedwith the cargofor 5 min , quickly washed and the dynamics of the probes were monitored over 5 min . At the start of the acquisition , there was a significantly lower ratio of dextran - filled Rab5 vesicles in cells affected by the co - expression of GTPase - deficient Cdc42 ( Fig . 7H ; Fig . S4A ) , showing that trafficking of internalised dextran to this early endosomal compartment was negatively affected . It should also be noted that therewasa highnumberofdextran - containing vesiclesthat , at the end of the acquisition , were still devoid of Rab5 , even in cells not co - expressing Cdc42 - Q61L , likely corresponding to alternative trafficking routes . Although fusion events could be distinguished between dextran - filled Rab5 compartments ( Fig . S4B ) , and between Fig . 7 . See next page for legend . 4191 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e separate GRAF1 compartments in cells co - expressing Cdc42 - Q61L ( Fig . 7I ) , no example of fusion between GRAF1 and Rab5 compartments was found despite frequent transient engagements observed between trapped GRAF1 compartments and labelled early endosomes ( Fig . 7I ) . As reflected by the Cdc42 - Q61L - enforced clustering of GRAF1 carriers resolved by CLEM , taken together , our study shows that GRAF1 - mediated inactivation of Cdc42 is not vital for the formation and budding of endocytic carriers , but for their further intracellular maturation . DISCUSSION Cell spreading and migration involve dynamic alterations in cell surface turnover supporting local membrane rigidity and flexibility through directed trafficking of lipids and surface receptors . This is reflected in the polarised activities of endocytic pathways including caveolae concentrated at the lagging edge , and fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) and CLICs enriched at the leading edge ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Chaudhary et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we show that direct interplay between GRAF1 and Cdc42 coordinates maturation of CLICs at the cell front and hence constitutes an efficient machinery for aiding in the turnover of membrane constituents . We found that GRAF1 dynamically assembled at the plasma membrane in discrete areas that did not overlap with the formation of clathrin - coated pits . The assemblies of GRAF1 were short lived and preceded by local membrane enrichment of Cdc42 , suggesting that GRAF1 is transiently recruited to membrane microdomains imposed by upstream Cdc42 activity . The concentration of GRAF1 will increase the local curvature of the membrane through the BAR domain , promoting membrane invagination . At the same time , this results in high spatially confined GAP activity to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 . The inactivation of Cdc42 has been shown to reduce the membrane domain association and thereby results in a more dynamic pool of Cdc42 ( Bendez\u00fa et al . , 2015 ; Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , the progressive assembly of GRAF1 correlated with a decrease in local Cdc42 enrichment . Given that we could not detect Cdc42 on internal carriers together with GRAF1 , we suggest that the transient interaction between the two proteins results in inactivation and a subsequent decrease in the membrane association of Cdc42 . This spatial restriction of Cdc42 activity could promote the identity transition from plasma membrane to an internal membrane compartment and facilitate further maturation . Based on this , we propose that the key role of GRAF1 in regulating turnover at the leading edge explains the previously described defect in the fusion of myoblasts and impaired migratory behaviour of cells lacking GRAF1 ( Doherty et al . , 2011a , b ; Lenhart et al . , 2014 ) . The initiation of the budding process and activation of Cdc42 might be facilitated by GEFs in response to extracellular signals , cellular polarisation or alterations in membrane tension . There are likely to be additional factors that are involved in the initiation and progression of CLIC formation . Previously , Arf1 has been shown to be essential for CLIC uptake , and the activation of Arf1 at the cell surface has been proposed to recruit ARHGAP10 to modulate Cdc42 activity ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . It is not yet known whether GRAF1 is directly coupled to these components or whether they regulate similar or distinct subtypes of CLICs . Actin polymerisation appears to play a central role in CLIC formation . Local actin - driven organisation of the cell surface has been suggested to promote endocytosis through clustering of lipids and proteins ( Gowrishankar et al . , 2012 ; Romer et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , actin polymerisation has been proposed to facilitate the release of carriers from the surface in a process controlled by Cdc42 ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we found that Cdc42 and the downstream WASP - mediated actin polymerisation were vital for processing of GRAF1 - positive carriers . Depletion of Cdc42 or the acute inhibition of actin polymerisation resulted in extended GRAF1 - decorated tubules associated with the cell surface . This shows that Cdc42 is not essential for GRAF1 membrane assembly , but suggests that Cdc42 - driven actin polymerisation plays a central role for processing of membrane invaginations generated by this mechanism . The effect on carriers could be due to impaired scission from the cell surface or reduced support from local cortical actin that relieves membrane tension and thereby promotes tubulation of the cell surface . Interestingly , it has recently been shown that perturbation of the cortical actin by inhibition or depletion of Cdc42 results in reduced membrane tension ( Bretou et al . , 2014 ) . We show that the depletion of either Cdc42 or GRAF1 results in a striking reduction in fluid uptake , consistent with that the cycling activities of Cdc42 substantially regulate the dynamics and turnover of the plasma membrane ( Kumari et al . , 2010 ) . However , the precise influence and effects of GTP - binding and hydrolysis has so far not been understood . Here , we show that the inactivation of Cdc42 was not required for the generation or the internalisation of GRAF1 - Fig . 7 .

Scale bar : 2 \u03bc m . 4192 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e positive CLICs given that neither the duration time of GRAF1 assemblies at the surface nor the total amount of internalised fluid was influenced by expression of Cdc42 - Q61L or GRAF1 mutated in the GAP domain . However , we show that inability of Cdc42 to hydrolyse GTP results in the accumulation of rapidly moving internal carriers coated by both GRAF1 and Cdc42 . Analysis of these carriers by CLEM showed that they were composed of multiple small vesicular and tubular structures with a mean diameter of 50 nm . This is in agreement with the previously described morphology of CLICs , and the proposed membrane curvature promoted by the BAR domain of GRAF1 ( Howes et al . , 2010a ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . We show that the Q61L mutation increases the affinity of Cdc42 for the GAP domain of GRAF1 , which could explain the prolonged time of residence of GRAF1 and Cdc42 on the carrier membrane . Our results suggest that this affects the maturation of carriers , possibly due to altered recruitment of endosomal proteins and lipid turnover . We found that the stalled carriers were able to fuse with each other but not with Rab5 - positive endosomes , suggesting that they were trapped in their membrane identity . CLIC and GEEC carriers have been shown to undergo homotypic and endosomal fusion ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) . We did not detect GRAF1 in EEA1 - positive endosomes , suggesting that this protein likely comes off the nascent vesicle to allow fusion with endosomal compartments . Taken together , the transient interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 will terminate Cdc42 activity and promote transition of the local PIP 2 - enriched membrane environment to enable release of GRAF1 and promote endosomal maturation . This might be facilitated by the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase - driven conversion of the lipid environment . Indeed GRAF1 , but not Cdc42 , has been detected on CLICs stalled by wortmannin treatment , which inhibits phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( Howes et al . , 2010a ) . We have previously shown that GRAF1 is detected in pleomorphic structures ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Because there is no definite cargo known for CLICs , it is difficult to know whether these structures represent distinct compartments or different steps of maturation of carriers . Characterisation of GRAF1 - positive carriers using the Flp - In T - Rex HeLa cell system revealed that the majority of GRAF1 structures detected at the cell periphery were small and transient . We also observed longer tubes , likely corresponding to the previously described endogenous GRAF1 - containing tubes ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that GRAF1 is involved in further membrane maturation events under some conditions . The stabilisation of CLIC and GEEC intermediates upon the expression of Cdc42 - Q61L phenotypically resembles the previously described trapping of an endosomal compartment induced by constant Arf6 activity ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the analogous Arf GAPs of the ASAP family are involved in regulating cytoskeletal and membrane reorganisation ( Randazzo et al . , 2007 ) , and might influence Arf activity and membrane curvature through a similar co - operative regulatory mechanism as proposed here . We believe that these types of systems should not be considered canonical means for receptor sorting and vesicle generation . Instead , they are optimised to regulate cell surface dynamics and the recycling of membrane reservoirs in response to external cues such as changes in adhesion or membrane tension . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies , probes and plasmids The polyclonal anti - GRAF1 rabbit antibody RA - 83 was produced as previously described ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Commercially acquired antibodies included rabbit anti - Myc ( 2272S , Cell Signaling Technology ) , mouse anti - clathrin heavy chain ( clone 23 , 610499 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) , mouse anti - AP50 ( clone 31 , 611351 , BD Transduction Laboratories ; an AP - 2 subunit ) , rabbit anti - Cdc42 ( ab109553 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - EEA1 ( 610456 , Clone 14 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) , mouse anti - GFP ( JL - 8 , 632381 , Living Colours ) and goat anti - aldolase ( AB1809 , Chemicon International , Inc . ) antibodies . Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor molecules ( Molecular Probes ) , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; Sigma - Aldrich and Agrisera ) and IRDye 800CW or 680RD ( LI - COR Biosciences ) were used for immunofluorescence and western blot detections . The fluorescent DNA probe DRAQ5 was obtained from BioStatus Limited , and the 10 kDa dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 and CTxB \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 647 were purchased from Molecular Probes . Cy3 \u2013 transferrin , 800CW - S - S - transferrin and 800CW - S - S - aminodextran were produced by covalently coupling respective cargo ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to amine - reactive Cy3 ( Amersham ) and 800CW - S - S ( LI - COR Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations . The plasmids used in this study are summarised in Table S1 . Constructs were created by PCR amplification of inserts with flanking restriction sites for ligation into corresponding vectors . Amino acid mutations were generated through site - directed PCR mutagenesis with PCR primers specified in Table S2 . Protein purification and pulldown experiments GST fusions of wild - type GRAF1 , its arginine finger mutated GAP truncate and Cdc42 proteins were purified as previously described ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ) . Thrombin ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) was used for tag removal . GST \u2013 GAP and GAP - R412D fusions were purified in 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl , and Cdc42 proteins in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 . The nucleotide loading of GTPases was performed at 30\u00b0C for 20 min in the presence of EDTA ( twofold molar excess to MgCl 2 ) and nucleotide ( 18 - fold molar excess to protein ) ( GTP \u03b3 S and GDP from Sigma - Aldrich ) . MgCl 2 ( twofold molar excess to EDTA ) was added to stop the reaction and the experimental buffer conditions were reached by buffer exchange in Micro Bio - Spin P - 6 Gel columns ( Bio - Rad ) . For the in vitro protein interaction experiments , glutathione \u2013 Sepharose - 4Bbead - bound GST - tagged protein baits were incubated with prey proteins for 1 \u2013 3 h at 4\u00b0C under rotation . The unbound protein was collected by centrifugation ( 400 g for 2 min ) , the bound protein was washed , and both fractions were boiled in sample buffer for analysis by SDS - PAGE . All assays including GDP - loaded GTPase were performed in the presence of AlF x ( 1 mM AlCl 3 , and 25 mM NaF ) . Cell culture and transfection HeLa cells ( ATCC - CRM - CCL - 2 ) were cultured in Dulbecco \u2019 s modified Eagle \u2019 s medium ( DMEM ; low glucose , L - glutamine , sodium pyruvate , HEPES and Phenol Red ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) . Flp - In T - REx HeLacell lines with tetracycline - inducible expression of GRAF1 , GRAF1 \u2013 GFP , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D were generated as previously described ( Mohan et al . , 2015 ) . Established cultures were grown in the mentioned DMEM , exceptions being during 800CW - S - S - cargo internalisation assays and live - cell acquisitions when basic medium containing 4 . 5 g / l glucose was used ( Gibco ) . The culturing media were further supplemented with 100 \u03bc g / ml hygromycin B and 5 \u03bc g / ml blasticidin S HCl ( Gibco ) for plasmid selection , and recombinant protein expression was induced by incubation in doxycycline hyclate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 20\u00b14 h . Targeted protein silencing was accomplished with siRNA against GRAF1 ( \u2018 siRNAb \u2019 Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , Cdc42 # 1 ( J - 005057 - 05 - 0020 ON - TARGET plus siRNA , Dharmacon ) , Cdc42 # 2 ( VHS40393 , Stealth siRNA , Life Technologies ) or AP - 2 ( AP2M1HSS101955 Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) , and a Medium GC Duplex RNA ( Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) served as the negative control . Transfections for transient expression of plasmids ( 16\u00b14 h ) and siRNA ( 60 \u2013 96 h ) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations . Protein expression levels were analysed in cleared cell lysates by western blotting and HRP or IRDye antigen detection using a Medical X - ray Processor ( Kodak ) or an Odyssey Sa reader ( LI - COR Biosciences ) , respectively .

At room temperature , the samples were washed in stripping buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 7 , 100 mM NaCl , and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 ) , reduced for 1 . 5 h in the same buffer supplemented with 60 mM MesNa and further washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cells were finally stained with 1 \u03bc M DRAQ5 for 30 min and washed in PBS before recording probe fluorescence using the Odyssey Sa reader . The uptake was defined as the ratio between the cell number ( the measured DRAQ5 fluorescence ) and the amount of internalised cargo ( the measured 800CW fluorescence ) . Cargo trafficking was also monitored by live - cell fluorescent microscopy directly after the addition of 3 \u03bc g / ml CTxB \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 647 or after 5 min of incubation with 0 . 5 \u2013 2 mg / ml dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 followed by a wash with preheated medium . The effects of actin polymerisation drugs on GRAF1 structures were analysed by fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells after treatment with 2 \u03bc M cytochalasin D , 2 \u03bc M latrunculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 \u03bc M wiskostatin ( Calbiochem ) or DMSO . Fluorescence microscopy Cellswerefixedandpreparedforimmunofluorescence analysisaspreviously described ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Images of fixed cell samples were captured using an epifluorescence Axioimager Z1 system ( AxioCam MRm camera ) ( Zeiss ) with the ZEN Software and a 63\u00d7 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil DIC 0 . 17 ) or an A1 R Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope system ( ANDOR iXon EMCCD camera ) ( Nikon Instruments ) under control of the NIS - Elements Microscope Imaging Software and a 60\u00d7 lens ( Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil \u03bb S 0 . 17 WD 0 . 14 , Nikon ) , at the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths . Live - cell confocal movies were recorded using the 63\u00d7 lens in the Nikon system or the 63\u00d7 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil DIC M27 ) in a Cell Observer Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope system ( ANDOR iXon Ultra ) ( Zeiss ) controlled by the ZEN Software . Real - time TIRF acquisitions were captured byemploying the 100\u00d7 lens in respective system [ Apochromat 1 . 49 Oil 0 . 13 - 0 . 20 DIC N2 ( Nikon ) or Plan - Apochromat 1 . 46 Oil DIC M27 ( Zeiss ) ] . Micrographs and the acquired movies were prepared ( cropped , rotated , linearly adjusted for intensity and converted ) using Adobe Photoshop or ImageJ . Correlative microscopy For correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy , cells were high - pressure frozen on sapphire discs ( 0 . 7 % low - melt agarose and DMEM ; HPM100 ) and processed by freeze substitution . 250 - \u00b5m sections were placed on 200 mesh copper grids with a carbon support film ( TAAB ) and immediately imaged by epifluorescence microscopy , with all above steps performed according to Kukulski et al . ( 2011 , 2012 ) . Grids were further dried , coated with 15 - nm gold particles conjugated to protein A ( BioCell ) and post - stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate . Grids were placed in a high - tilt dual - axis holder ( Fischione Instruments ) and electron tomograms corresponding to the fluorescent structures of interest ( determined from recorded grid positions ) were acquired using a Tecnai F30 electron microscope ( FEI ) at 300 kV , equipped with an Eagel 4 k CCD camera ( FEI ) using serial electron microscopy ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . The 9400\u00d7 magnification tomograms were acquired as single - axis and the 15 , 500\u00d7 magnification tomograms as dual - axis tilt series over \u2212 60\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 ( 1 . 5\u00b0 increment ) . All tomograms were reconstructed , modelled and quantified with the IMOD package version 4 . 7 . 10 ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . The 15 , 500\u00d7 magnification tomograms used for the detailed models have a voxel size of 7 . 67 \u00c5 . Fluorescent micrographs , models and tomograms were overlaid using Adobe Photoshop . Image analysis and quantifications Protein bands on western blots detected with HRP - conjugated antibodies were determined from scanned images in ImageJ to derive the relative sample protein content . Estimations of the fraction of fixed cells with GFP \u2013 GRAF1 proteins in abundant or tubular structures were performed by epifluorescent visual assessment . The Imaris Software V7 . 5 ( Bitplane ) was utilised to analyse micrographs captured from fixed and live - cell samples as specified in Table S3 . The recruitment of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP to mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 membrane domains was analysed by comparing the fluorescence intensity profiles of each channel over time , from the live - cell confocal spinning disc acquisitions . The mean intensity value within a five - unit - diameter circular ROI , spanning each structure of interest , was obtained for each channel and frame using the \u2018 Plot Z - axis profile \u2019 tool in ImageJ . The start and end of each intensity peak were defined as the time points where the calculated mean intensity values rose above and declined below , respectively , the background . Parameters of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L carriers calculated from the correlative microscopy were derived from measurements on the constructed 3D image using the IMOD package . Statistics Statistical tests were performed using Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software ) with the indicated sample size and number of independent experiments .

Here , we describe how a direct interaction between the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and the GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) GRAF1 ( also known as ARHGAP26 ) , facilitates rapid cell surface turnover at the leading edge . Both Cdc42 and GRAF1 were required for fluid - phase uptake and regulated the generation of transient GRAF1 - coated endocytic carriers , which were distinct from clathrin - coated vesicles . GRAF1 was found to transiently assemble at discrete Cdc42 - enriched punctae at the plasma membrane , resulting in a corresponding decrease in the microdomain association of Cdc42 . However , Cdc42 captured in its active state was , through a GAP - domain - mediated interaction , localised together with GRAF1 on accumulated internal structures derived from the cell surface . Correlative fluorescence and electron tomography microscopy revealed that these structures were clusters of small membrane carriers with defective endosomal processing . We conclude that a transient interaction between Cdc42 and GRAF1 drives endocytic turnover and controls the transition essential for endosomal maturation of plasma membrane internalised by this mechanism . KEY WORDS : Clathrin - independent endocytosis , GRAF1 , Cdc42 , Cell surface , Actin INTRODUCTION Cell surface dynamics are fundamental to a variety of basic biological processes , such as migration , polarisation and division , as well as protein and lipid trafficking . Intimate coupling to an underlying meshwork of cortical actin keeps the plasma membrane under high tension , providing the cell surface with its vital strength to withstand mechanical stress ( Gauthier et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , structural alterations of the cell surface can only be achieved through the intricate coordination of membrane remodelling events and cytoskeletal rearrangements ( de Curtis and Meldolesi , 2012 ) . Small G - proteins of the Rho GTPase family are known as master regulators of the cytoskeleton and have been shown to greatly influence membrane tension and plasma membrane turnover by regulating endocytic and exocytic events ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ; Ridley , 2001 ) . Rho GTPases are peripherally attached to the membrane through lipid modifications and are active in their GTP - loaded state , where they interact with various effector molecules and function as molecular switches through rounds of GTP hydrolysis . The activity , which is stimulated by external cues , is strictly regulated by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) , which promote GTP hydrolysis and facilitate loading of GTP , respectively ( Jaffe and Hall , 2005 ) . However , the intricate mechanisms that allow for a cyclical nucleotide exchange in small G - proteins to synchronise membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics are still not understood . The clathrin - independent carrier ( CLIC ) pathway , a major pinocytic endocytic route in fibroblasts , facilitates polarised and rapid uptake of fluid , bacterial toxins , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - linked receptors and receptors involved in cell adhesion ( Howes et al . , 2010a ) . CLICs were originally defined by their dependence on the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and tubular morphology , separating them from clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolae ( Hansen and Nichols , 2009 ; Howes et al . , 2010b ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . Carriers derived from this pathway have been shown to fuse into GPI - enriched endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) , which subsequently merge with early endosomes or recycling endosomes ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) . The formation of CLICs depends on a poorly characterised molecular system , involving the small G - proteins Cdc42 and Arf1 , and their regulatory proteins ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . Although CLICs account for a major portion of the endocytic turnover of the plasma membrane , very little mechanistic detail is available regarding their formation . It has previously been shown that GRAF1 ( also known as ARHGAP26 ) , a GAP active against Cdc42 ( Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ; Jelen et al . , 2009 ; Longenecker et al . , 2000 ) , is essential for CLIC uptake ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . GRAF1 is a dimeric multidomain protein composed of Bin , amphiphysin , RVS161 / 167 ( BAR ) , pleckstrin homology ( PH ) , GAP and Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . The BAR and PH domains can generate and / or stabilise highly curved endocytic membranes from phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) - enriched regions , whereas the C - terminal GAP and SH3 domains modulates Cdc42 activity and interacts with regulatory proteins , respectively ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ; Hildebrand et al . , 1996 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Okada et al . , 2011 ) . Loss of GRAF1 downregulates endocytosis and affects cellular processes such as cortical actin remodelling , integrin trafficking , adhesion , spreading , migration and fusion , suggesting that this protein is an important regulator of cell surface dynamics ( Doherty et al . , 2011a , b ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ; Nonnenmacher and Weber , 2011 ; Simpson et al . , 2008 ; Stergiou et al . , 2013 ) . In this work , we studied the interplay between GRAF1 and Cdc42 to decipher its importance for coordination of membrane and Received 13 May 2015 ; Accepted 28 September 2015 1 Integrative Medical Biology , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 2 Medical Biochemistryand Biophysics , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 3 Molecular Biology , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 901 87 , Sweden . 4 European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Meyerhofstr . 1 , Heidelberg 69117 , Germany . * Author for correspondence ( richard . lundmark @ umu . se ) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 3 . 0 ) , which permits unrestricted use , distributionandreproductioninanymediumprovidedthattheoriginalworkisproperlyattributed . 4183 \u00a9 2015 . Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e actin dynamics during cell surface turnover at the leading edge . We characterise GRAF1 as a molecular marker of CLICs and demonstrate how this protein , through a direct interaction , regulates Cdc42 activity during endocytosis . This study also defines a temporal and spatial restriction of active Cdc42 as a prerequisite for the internalisation and further trafficking of cell surface components . RESULTS Correlative light and electron microscopy reveals highly curved membrane carriers decorated by GRAF1 and GTPase - deficient Cdc42 Consistent with the proposed involvement of the GTPase Cdc42 and the GAP GRAF1 in the generation of CLICs , GRAF1 localised with a dominant - active form of Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - Q61L , which is deficient in GTP hydrolysis ) to discrete assemblies in fixed cells ( Fig . 1A ) . As a step towards determining their identity , correlative light and electron tomography microscopy ( CLEM ) was used to resolve the ultrastructure of these assemblies . High - pressure frozen cells transfected with GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L were further prepared for CLEM as described in the Materials and Methods ( Kukulski et al . , 2011 ; Nixon et al . , 2009 ) . By overlaying the captured epifluorescence micrograph with high - resolution electron tomograms acquired from the same sample and region of interest ( ROI ) , it was apparent that all the fluorescent spots containing both proteins overlapped with small membranous structures ( Fig . 1B ) . Cdc42 - Q61L fluorescence alone , commonly seen lining the cell edge , was instead associated with the plasma membrane . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) models of the membranous structures , reconstructed from the tomograms , revealed that the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - positive structures detected by epifluorescence microscopy actually corresponded to tightly packed clusters of membrane carriers ( Fig . 1B ) . Most of the carriers were separated from the plasma membrane , but examples of tubular structures connected to the cell surface were also found ( Fig . 1B ) . Although they were quite morphologically diverse , the modelled carriers could roughly be divided into being either disc - like or tube - like on the basis of their shape ( Fig . 1C ; compare to the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - negative clathrin - coated vesicle ) . The measurement of the minor axis of each structure further indicated a surprisingly conserved diameter , spanning 20 \u2013 60 nm in 97 % of the carriers ( Fig . 1D ) . The close proximity of the GRAF1 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - positive carriers to the basal cell surface , evident using confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) , was further confirmed by the reconstructed 3D models . The carrier clusters were detected within 500 nm of the basal membrane , and their distance to the cell edge , as measured in the x - y plane , ranged between 360 and 2200 nm . Taken together , the information collected from light and electron microscopy shows that GRAF1 and GTPase - deficient Cdc42 localise to carriers formed near the cell surface that have a morphology consistent with the membrane compartments previously defined as CLICs . GRAF1 is a marker of CLICs that are rapidly forming at the leading edge of cells To enable the dissection of a potential molecular interplay between Cdc42 and GRAF1 during CLIC formation , a cell model system was established utilising GRAF1 as a pathway marker . In a Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell line , untagged or GFP - tagged GRAF1 was placed under the control of a tet promoter modulated by doxycycline , resulting in an inducible system for the expression of a controlled amount of protein ( Fig . 2A ) . The protein expression level adapted for all subsequent experiments was chosen as to enable the detection of fluorescently tagged GRAF1 by microscopy , inevitably resulting in protein levels above the comparatively low endogenous level in this specific HeLa cell line . However , in contrast to using transient overexpression of GRAF1 , the developed Flp - In T - REx cell lines importantly allowed more reproducible and homogenous protein levels within the cultures ( Fig . S1A ) . In fixed cells , confocal microscopy showed that GRAF1 , independent of the presence of a fluorescent tag , assembled into punctate and , much less frequently , tubular structures at the cell surface ( Fig . S1B ) . In agreement with previous results detecting endogenous and transiently expressed GRAF1 in HeLa cells ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , these assemblies colocalised with a fraction of the promiscuous cargo cholera toxin B - subunit ( CTxB ) , as assayed after 2 min internalisation at 37\u00b0C ( Fig . S2A ) . Moreover , these assemblies were only on very rare occasions found to overlap with clathrin - associated markers like transferrin ( Tfn ) and AP - 2 ( the adaptin for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) , or the early endosomal marker EEA1 ( Fig . S2A ) . Analysis by live - cell spinning disc confocal microscopy revealed the formation of abundant short - lived GRAF1 \u2013 GFP - positive punctae at the leading edge of cells ( Fig . 2B ; Movie 1 ) . Software was used to create tracks corresponding to each detected structure , and from these the duration time of each track was derived . The average lifetime ( track duration ) of the dynamic GRAF1 assemblies was thereby determined to be \u223c 10 s ( Fig . 2C ) , showing that the protein was transiently assembled at the leading edge . This is in agreement with GRAF1 being associated with CLICs , which are dynamically formed at the cell periphery during cell spreading and migration ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ; Howes et al . , 2010a ) . To determine whether GRAF1 assembled at the plasma membrane , cells were followed by live - cell total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Structure tracks were created from the acquisitions and the duration of each track was calculated . The lifetimes of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP and GFP \u2013 GRAF1 assemblies were comparable to that detected by spinning disc confocal microscopy , suggesting that the burst in GRAF1 fluorescence corresponded to activity very near or at the cell surface ( Fig . 2D ; Fig . S1C ) . In agreement with this , detecting the surface binding and uptake of fluorescently tagged CTxB by performing live - cell TIRF microscopy revealed the recruitment of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 to CTxB clusters and the subsequent disappearance of both markers from the surface , indicative of endocytic carrier formation ( Fig . S2B ) . Importantly , in GRAF1 \u2013 GFP cells co - expressing mCherry - tagged clathrin light chain , live - cell TIRF microscopy followed by track analysis showed no overlap between the two proteins ( Fig . 2E ; Movie 2 ) , implying that GRAF1 does not aid the process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . It should be noted that GRAF1 assemblies were not exclusively observed at the leading edge of cells and that an increased fraction of the assemblies in the centre and rear of cells displayed duration times longer than 30 s ( Fig . S1D , E ) . LossofCdc42andactinpolymerisation impairGRAF1 carrier processing and the fluid - phase endocytic capacity Cdc42 was identified as a key regulator of CLIC - mediated endocytosis on the basis of the effects that overexpressed Cdc42 activity mutants exerted on the uptake through this pathway ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . To test the importance of Cdc42 and GRAF1 for clathrin - independent endocytosis in our established Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell lines , fluid - phase internalisation was quantified in cells depleted of either of these two proteins , or of AP - 2 by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . To control for effects on clathrin - mediated endocytosis , internalisation of transferrin was 4184 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e also assayed . The fluorescence of transferrin - S - S - CW800 or dextran - S - S - CW800 was measured after MesNa - reduction to remove surface - exposed fluorophores , and the internalisation was quantified in relation to that of cells transfected with control siRNA ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Although dextran uptake was impaired in all three samples , transferrin uptake was only significantly reduced in AP - 2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3A ) , verifying the importance of Cdc42 and GRAF1 in clathrin - independent endocytosis . The \u223c 50 % reduction of dextran uptake seen in all samples further indicated that clathrin - independent and - dependent pathways , under these conditions , contribute to roughly equal amounts of internalised fluid volume . To investigate the importance of Cdc42 function on GRAF1 - mediated carrier formation , the localisation and behaviour of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP was followed by live - cell spinning disc confocal microscopy in cells depleted of Cdc42 . Although GRAF1 in these cells could still be found in dynamic assemblies at the leading edge , there was a marked increase of GRAF1 - decorated tubular structures associated with the cell surface ( Fig . 3C ; Fig . S3A , B ) . This implies that GRAF1 in cells with a decreased available pool of Cdc42 can exert its sculpting and / or stabilising function on the plasma membrane , but in the absence of the GTPase that this activity is not properly regulated . Interestingly , active Cdc42 has been shown to be important for recruitment of the Wiskott \u2013 Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - dependent actin machinery to aid CLIC formation ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Similar to the effect seen after Cdc42 depletion , cells treated with the WASP - inhibitor wiskostatin showed a time - dependent increase of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - decorated tubes associated with the cell surface ( Fig . 3D , E ) . The same phenotype was also observed after treatment with the actin - depolymerising drugs latrunculin A and cytochalasin D ( Fig . S3C ) , previously shown to inhibit uptake through CLICs ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . The altered processing of GRAF1 - mediated carriers in Cdc42 - depleted cells is likely to be at least a contributing factor to their impaired endocytic capacity , and a result of dysregulated Cdc42 - dependent actin dynamics .

Remarkably , 94 % of the GRAF1 assemblies that transiently appeared at the leading edge overlapped with membrane - associated Cdc42 . Moreover , 88 % of these assemblies were recruited to existing microdomains enriched with the GTPase . Further dissection of the indicated interdependency between the two proteins was accomplished by detailed analysis of fluorescence intensity plots created for each detected structure and channel over time ( Fig . 4B ) . The lack of major lateral movements in the detected GRAF1 punctae allowed the intensity value calculations to be restricted to circular ROIs ( Fig . 4B ) . The peak range and maximum was determined for each structure and channel , as described in the Materials and Methods . An average GRAF1 assembly lifetime of 18 s was approximated on the basis of the determined peak ranges , which was slightly longer , but in the same range , as the \u223c 10 s calculated from the track durations ( Fig . 4C , compare to Fig . 2C ) . Quantification of the lifetime overlap between GRAF1 and Cdc42 assemblies averaged 99 % , consistent with the visual assessment above ( Fig . 4D ) . Interestingly , there was a clear trend of Cdc42 reaching the maximum intensity value before GRAF1 ( on average 5 s before the GRAF1 intensity maximum , and 3 s after the start of the GRAF1 peak ) ( Fig . 4E ) . Consistent with this , for 49 % of the analysed structures , it was evident that the Cdc42 intensity decreased as the GRAF1 intensity increased ( compared to 82 % when analysing the GRAF1 intensity decrease ) ( Fig . 4F ) . This suggests that GRAF1 somehow antagonises the existing cell surface enrichment of Cdc42 as it assembles on the membrane , likely by mediating its internalisation and / or transiently interacting with the GTPase to switch it off and thereby destabilising its association with the microdomain . An interaction between the GAP domain and transition state Cdc42 enforces membrane assembly of GRAF1 To investigate the impact of the Cdc42 activity state on GRAF1 membrane assembly , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 Flp - In T - REx HeLa cells co - expressing CoralHue - tagged dominant - negative ( nucleotide - binding deficient T17N ) , wild - type and dominant - active Cdc42 were analysed by confocal microscopy . In comparison to the other two samples , Cdc42 - Q61L - transfected cells showed a striking accumulation of GRAF1 in bright punctate and tubular Fig . 2 .

Moreover , this phenotype was dependent on the membrane localisation of the GTPase because it was abolished after introducing a point mutation of the cysteine residue ( C188A ) responsible for anchoring Cdc42 to the membrane ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Notably , no accumulation of GRAF1 structures was seen in cells co - expressing dominant - active RhoA - Q63L or Rac1 - Q61L ( Fig . 5A ) , two other GTPases within the same Rho family of actin regulators , confirming the specificity of the induced phenotype . In vitro pulldown experiments were used to determine whether the Cdc42 - Q61L mutation somehow influenced the otherwise inherently transient interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 , to thereby so profoundly affect GRAF1 membrane assembly . Using purified GST - tagged GRAF1 GAP domains as bait and Cdc42 or Cdc42 - Q61L loaded with GTP \u03b3 S ( a more stable GTP analogue ) as prey , revealed a preference in binding to the mutant ( Fig . 5C ) . However , repeating the assay with GDP - loaded GTPase in the presence of AlF x , to mimic the transition state conformation ( Mittal et al . , 1996 ) , resulted , in addition , to detectable binding to wild - type Cdc42 ( Fig . 5C ) . The Q61L mutation in Cdc42 increased the affinity to GRAF1 , likely by imposing an active site conformation , suggesting that the accumulation of GRAF1 assemblies in cells overexpressing this mutant is the effect of an enforced prolonged direct interaction . To test this hypothesis in vivo , HeLa cells transiently co - expressing CoralHue - tagged Cdc42 - Q61L and a GFP - tagged GAP domain containing or lacking truncates of GRAF1 , were analysed by confocal microscopy . Like full - length GRAF1 , the BAR - PH - GAP truncate showed an extensive accumulation in punctate and tubular structures together with the mutated GTPase ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Importantly , this effect was not seen with GFP \u2013 BAR - PH , confirming that it was dependent on the presence of the GAP domain . To avoid potential averse consequences of overexpressing truncated proteins , a Flp - In T - REx HeLa cell line was established with an inducible expression of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D , a point mutant disrupted in the so - called arginine finger known to be vital for the GAP activity ( Jelen et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . S3D , E ) . Co - expression of Cdc42 - Q61L in this cell line did not result in any accumulation of GRAF1 - R412D structures ( Fig . 5A ; Fig . S3G ) , verifying that the enforced GRAF1 membrane accumulation induced by GTPase - deficient Cdc42 is a consequence of a direct interaction between the two proteins . GTP hydrolysis deficiency traps Cdc42 together with GRAF1 on endocytic vesicles The confirmed interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 in vivo , begged the question as to whether GRAF1 - mediated inactivation of Cdc42 was important during endocytic carrier formation . To resolve how Cdc42 activity influenced the formation of endocytic carriers , the dynamics of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 assemblies in Flp - In Fig . 3 .

The cargo uptake was normalised to the corresponding control siRNA - transfected sample and the significance in relation to this sample was determined by analyses of at least three independent experiments ( mean\u00b1s . d . ; Mann \u2013 Whitney U tests , n = 3 \u2013 4 samples , \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ; ns , not significant ; * P < 0 . 05 ) .

Individual GRAF1 structures detected over the whole basal membrane were tracked over time in the acquisitions ( Fig . 6A ) and used to calculate the number of assemblies , their lifetime ( track duration ) , the distance between their appearance and disappearance ( track displacement ) , and the maximum speed of the structures ( Fig . 6B \u2013 E ) . Consistent with the results from fixed cells , co - expression of Cdc42 - Q61L resulted in four times more GRAF1 assemblies than detected in the other samples ( Fig . 6B ) . Notably , no clear difference in lifetime ( track duration ) of GRAF1 assemblies was found between Cdc42 - and Cdc42 - Q61L - expressing cells ( Fig . 6C ) , showing that the GRAF1 membrane accumulation enforced by Cdc42 - Q61L was not trapping the protein at the cell surface . However , the GRAF1 structures in cells co - expressing the GTPase - deficient mutant exhibited both an increased lateral mobility ( track displacement ) and a higher maximum speed ( Fig . 6D , E ) . Although the directional movement revealed by the track pattern of GRAF1 structures in Cdc42 - Q61L co - expressing cells ( Fig . 6A ) was unlikely to represent diffusion within the membrane , it could be explained by enforced GRAF1 assembly on intracellular vesicles trafficked along cytoskeletal tracks near the cell surface that are in close enough proximity to the plasma membrane to be detected within the TIRF field . To further explore the mobility of the GRAF1 assemblies enforced by co - expression of GTPase - hydrolysis - deficient Cdc42 , live - cell spinning disc microscopy was employed to increase the depth of the fluorescence probe detection in the focal plane of interest ( i . e . a plane close to , but just above , the basal membrane ) . In GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells co - expressing mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L , the proteins localised together both on budding carriers and intracellular laterally mobile vesicles ( Fig . 6F ; Movie 4 ) . The appearance of the latter type of structures in the TIRF and captured confocal fields indicates that carriers formed from the cell surface , positive for both proteins , later stay or reappear in a plane near the plasma membrane . From live - cell spinning disc microscopy acquisitions of cells co - expressing either wild - type Cdc42 or Cdc42 - Q61L , the detected structures of GRAF1 and respective GTPase protein were tracked and the time range of colocalisation was calculated . The colocalisation of GRAF1 and Cdc42 was significantly more transient than that of GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L ( Fig . 6G ) , suggesting that the prolonged interaction between GRAF1 and GTP - hydrolysis - deficient Cdc42 results in a longer co - existence of the proteins on internalised vesicles ( i . e . an entrapment of both proteins on budded vesicles ) .

Dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 was added to GFP \u2013 GRAF1 Flp - In T - REx HeLa cells co - expressing Myc \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L as a 5 - min pulse , then a quick wash was used to remove the excess extracellular marker and probes were followed by live - cell confocal microscopy . Immediately after the pulse , dextran was enriched in approximately one third of the accumulated GRAF1 structures ( Fig . 7A ) , verifying that these correspond to plasma - membrane - derived and budded endocytic carriers . The same protocol was used to prepare fixed samples for epifluorecence microscopy . Dextran could also be visualised in GRAF1 - positive carriers under fixed conditions ( Fig . 7B ) , but it should be noted that permeabilisation of fixed samples was avoided , given that the detection of this marker deteriorates with detergent treatment . Using software to define dextran compartments from the captured images , it was determined that the total uptake of fluid - phase was not significantly altered in cells affected by the Cdc42 - Q61L transfection ( Fig . 7C ) . Also in line with this , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D cells showed a higher prevalence of membrane assemblies in comparison to GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells ( Fig . S3H ) , without any detectable effect on dextran endocytosis ( Fig . 7E ; Fig . S3F ) , further verifying that the GRAF1 GAP activity against Cdc42 was not required for endocytic carrier formation . The entrapment of GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L on erratically behaving internalised vesicles , pointed towards a post - fission trafficking defect . Strikingly , in GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L co - Fig . 5 .

Furthermore , carriers decorated by GRAF1 and Cdc42 - Q61L were never positive for EEA1 ( Fig . 7G ) , suggesting that these more likely represented a trapped intermediate membrane compartment . To explore this in more detail , dextran trafficking was captured in GFP \u2013 GRAF1 cells co - expressing BFP \u2013 Rab5 alone , or together with Myc \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L , by live - cell spinningdiscmicroscopy . Cells were pulsedwith the cargofor 5 min , quickly washed and the dynamics of the probes were monitored over 5 min . At the start of the acquisition , there was a significantly lower ratio of dextran - filled Rab5 vesicles in cells affected by the co - expression of GTPase - deficient Cdc42 ( Fig . 7H ; Fig . S4A ) , showing that trafficking of internalised dextran to this early endosomal compartment was negatively affected . It should also be noted that therewasa highnumberofdextran - containing vesiclesthat , at the end of the acquisition , were still devoid of Rab5 , even in cells not co - expressing Cdc42 - Q61L , likely corresponding to alternative trafficking routes . Although fusion events could be distinguished between dextran - filled Rab5 compartments ( Fig . S4B ) , and between Fig . 7 . See next page for legend . 4191 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e separate GRAF1 compartments in cells co - expressing Cdc42 - Q61L ( Fig . 7I ) , no example of fusion between GRAF1 and Rab5 compartments was found despite frequent transient engagements observed between trapped GRAF1 compartments and labelled early endosomes ( Fig . 7I ) . As reflected by the Cdc42 - Q61L - enforced clustering of GRAF1 carriers resolved by CLEM , taken together , our study shows that GRAF1 - mediated inactivation of Cdc42 is not vital for the formation and budding of endocytic carriers , but for their further intracellular maturation . DISCUSSION Cell spreading and migration involve dynamic alterations in cell surface turnover supporting local membrane rigidity and flexibility through directed trafficking of lipids and surface receptors . This is reflected in the polarised activities of endocytic pathways including caveolae concentrated at the lagging edge , and fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) and CLICs enriched at the leading edge ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Chaudhary et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we show that direct interplay between GRAF1 and Cdc42 coordinates maturation of CLICs at the cell front and hence constitutes an efficient machinery for aiding in the turnover of membrane constituents . We found that GRAF1 dynamically assembled at the plasma membrane in discrete areas that did not overlap with the formation of clathrin - coated pits . The assemblies of GRAF1 were short lived and preceded by local membrane enrichment of Cdc42 , suggesting that GRAF1 is transiently recruited to membrane microdomains imposed by upstream Cdc42 activity . The concentration of GRAF1 will increase the local curvature of the membrane through the BAR domain , promoting membrane invagination . At the same time , this results in high spatially confined GAP activity to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 . The inactivation of Cdc42 has been shown to reduce the membrane domain association and thereby results in a more dynamic pool of Cdc42 ( Bendez\u00fa et al . , 2015 ; Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , the progressive assembly of GRAF1 correlated with a decrease in local Cdc42 enrichment . Given that we could not detect Cdc42 on internal carriers together with GRAF1 , we suggest that the transient interaction between the two proteins results in inactivation and a subsequent decrease in the membrane association of Cdc42 . This spatial restriction of Cdc42 activity could promote the identity transition from plasma membrane to an internal membrane compartment and facilitate further maturation . Based on this , we propose that the key role of GRAF1 in regulating turnover at the leading edge explains the previously described defect in the fusion of myoblasts and impaired migratory behaviour of cells lacking GRAF1 ( Doherty et al . , 2011a , b ; Lenhart et al . , 2014 ) . The initiation of the budding process and activation of Cdc42 might be facilitated by GEFs in response to extracellular signals , cellular polarisation or alterations in membrane tension . There are likely to be additional factors that are involved in the initiation and progression of CLIC formation . Previously , Arf1 has been shown to be essential for CLIC uptake , and the activation of Arf1 at the cell surface has been proposed to recruit ARHGAP10 to modulate Cdc42 activity ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . It is not yet known whether GRAF1 is directly coupled to these components or whether they regulate similar or distinct subtypes of CLICs . Actin polymerisation appears to play a central role in CLIC formation . Local actin - driven organisation of the cell surface has been suggested to promote endocytosis through clustering of lipids and proteins ( Gowrishankar et al . , 2012 ; Romer et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , actin polymerisation has been proposed to facilitate the release of carriers from the surface in a process controlled by Cdc42 ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we found that Cdc42 and the downstream WASP - mediated actin polymerisation were vital for processing of GRAF1 - positive carriers . Depletion of Cdc42 or the acute inhibition of actin polymerisation resulted in extended GRAF1 - decorated tubules associated with the cell surface . This shows that Cdc42 is not essential for GRAF1 membrane assembly , but suggests that Cdc42 - driven actin polymerisation plays a central role for processing of membrane invaginations generated by this mechanism . The effect on carriers could be due to impaired scission from the cell surface or reduced support from local cortical actin that relieves membrane tension and thereby promotes tubulation of the cell surface . Interestingly , it has recently been shown that perturbation of the cortical actin by inhibition or depletion of Cdc42 results in reduced membrane tension ( Bretou et al . , 2014 ) . We show that the depletion of either Cdc42 or GRAF1 results in a striking reduction in fluid uptake , consistent with that the cycling activities of Cdc42 substantially regulate the dynamics and turnover of the plasma membrane ( Kumari et al . , 2010 ) . However , the precise influence and effects of GTP - binding and hydrolysis has so far not been understood . Here , we show that the inactivation of Cdc42 was not required for the generation or the internalisation of GRAF1 - Fig . 7 .

However , we show that inability of Cdc42 to hydrolyse GTP results in the accumulation of rapidly moving internal carriers coated by both GRAF1 and Cdc42 . Analysis of these carriers by CLEM showed that they were composed of multiple small vesicular and tubular structures with a mean diameter of 50 nm . This is in agreement with the previously described morphology of CLICs , and the proposed membrane curvature promoted by the BAR domain of GRAF1 ( Howes et al . , 2010a ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . We show that the Q61L mutation increases the affinity of Cdc42 for the GAP domain of GRAF1 , which could explain the prolonged time of residence of GRAF1 and Cdc42 on the carrier membrane . Our results suggest that this affects the maturation of carriers , possibly due to altered recruitment of endosomal proteins and lipid turnover . We found that the stalled carriers were able to fuse with each other but not with Rab5 - positive endosomes , suggesting that they were trapped in their membrane identity . CLIC and GEEC carriers have been shown to undergo homotypic and endosomal fusion ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) . We did not detect GRAF1 in EEA1 - positive endosomes , suggesting that this protein likely comes off the nascent vesicle to allow fusion with endosomal compartments . Taken together , the transient interaction between GRAF1 and Cdc42 will terminate Cdc42 activity and promote transition of the local PIP 2 - enriched membrane environment to enable release of GRAF1 and promote endosomal maturation . This might be facilitated by the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase - driven conversion of the lipid environment . Indeed GRAF1 , but not Cdc42 , has been detected on CLICs stalled by wortmannin treatment , which inhibits phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( Howes et al . , 2010a ) . We have previously shown that GRAF1 is detected in pleomorphic structures ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Because there is no definite cargo known for CLICs , it is difficult to know whether these structures represent distinct compartments or different steps of maturation of carriers . Characterisation of GRAF1 - positive carriers using the Flp - In T - Rex HeLa cell system revealed that the majority of GRAF1 structures detected at the cell periphery were small and transient . We also observed longer tubes , likely corresponding to the previously described endogenous GRAF1 - containing tubes ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that GRAF1 is involved in further membrane maturation events under some conditions . The stabilisation of CLIC and GEEC intermediates upon the expression of Cdc42 - Q61L phenotypically resembles the previously described trapping of an endosomal compartment induced by constant Arf6 activity ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the analogous Arf GAPs of the ASAP family are involved in regulating cytoskeletal and membrane reorganisation ( Randazzo et al . , 2007 ) , and might influence Arf activity and membrane curvature through a similar co - operative regulatory mechanism as proposed here . We believe that these types of systems should not be considered canonical means for receptor sorting and vesicle generation . Instead , they are optimised to regulate cell surface dynamics and the recycling of membrane reservoirs in response to external cues such as changes in adhesion or membrane tension . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies , probes and plasmids The polyclonal anti - GRAF1 rabbit antibody RA - 83 was produced as previously described ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Commercially acquired antibodies included rabbit anti - Myc ( 2272S , Cell Signaling Technology ) , mouse anti - clathrin heavy chain ( clone 23 , 610499 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) , mouse anti - AP50 ( clone 31 , 611351 , BD Transduction Laboratories ; an AP - 2 subunit ) , rabbit anti - Cdc42 ( ab109553 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - EEA1 ( 610456 , Clone 14 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) , mouse anti - GFP ( JL - 8 , 632381 , Living Colours ) and goat anti - aldolase ( AB1809 , Chemicon International , Inc . ) antibodies . Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor molecules ( Molecular Probes ) , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; Sigma - Aldrich and Agrisera ) and IRDye 800CW or 680RD ( LI - COR Biosciences ) were used for immunofluorescence and western blot detections . The fluorescent DNA probe DRAQ5 was obtained from BioStatus Limited , and the 10 kDa dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 and CTxB \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 647 were purchased from Molecular Probes . Cy3 \u2013 transferrin , 800CW - S - S - transferrin and 800CW - S - S - aminodextran were produced by covalently coupling respective cargo ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to amine - reactive Cy3 ( Amersham ) and 800CW - S - S ( LI - COR Biosciences ) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations . The plasmids used in this study are summarised in Table S1 . Constructs were created by PCR amplification of inserts with flanking restriction sites for ligation into corresponding vectors . Amino acid mutations were generated through site - directed PCR mutagenesis with PCR primers specified in Table S2 . Protein purification and pulldown experiments GST fusions of wild - type GRAF1 , its arginine finger mutated GAP truncate and Cdc42 proteins were purified as previously described ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ) . Thrombin ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) was used for tag removal . GST \u2013 GAP and GAP - R412D fusions were purified in 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl , and Cdc42 proteins in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 . The nucleotide loading of GTPases was performed at 30\u00b0C for 20 min in the presence of EDTA ( twofold molar excess to MgCl 2 ) and nucleotide ( 18 - fold molar excess to protein ) ( GTP \u03b3 S and GDP from Sigma - Aldrich ) . MgCl 2 ( twofold molar excess to EDTA ) was added to stop the reaction and the experimental buffer conditions were reached by buffer exchange in Micro Bio - Spin P - 6 Gel columns ( Bio - Rad ) . For the in vitro protein interaction experiments , glutathione \u2013 Sepharose - 4Bbead - bound GST - tagged protein baits were incubated with prey proteins for 1 \u2013 3 h at 4\u00b0C under rotation . The unbound protein was collected by centrifugation ( 400 g for 2 min ) , the bound protein was washed , and both fractions were boiled in sample buffer for analysis by SDS - PAGE . All assays including GDP - loaded GTPase were performed in the presence of AlF x ( 1 mM AlCl 3 , and 25 mM NaF ) . Cell culture and transfection HeLa cells ( ATCC - CRM - CCL - 2 ) were cultured in Dulbecco \u2019 s modified Eagle \u2019 s medium ( DMEM ; low glucose , L - glutamine , sodium pyruvate , HEPES and Phenol Red ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) . Flp - In T - REx HeLacell lines with tetracycline - inducible expression of GRAF1 , GRAF1 \u2013 GFP , GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and GFP \u2013 GRAF1 - R412D were generated as previously described ( Mohan et al . , 2015 ) . Established cultures were grown in the mentioned DMEM , exceptions being during 800CW - S - S - cargo internalisation assays and live - cell acquisitions when basic medium containing 4 . 5 g / l glucose was used ( Gibco ) . The culturing media were further supplemented with 100 \u03bc g / ml hygromycin B and 5 \u03bc g / ml blasticidin S HCl ( Gibco ) for plasmid selection , and recombinant protein expression was induced by incubation in doxycycline hyclate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 20\u00b14 h . Targeted protein silencing was accomplished with siRNA against GRAF1 ( \u2018 siRNAb \u2019 Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , Cdc42 # 1 ( J - 005057 - 05 - 0020 ON - TARGET plus siRNA , Dharmacon ) , Cdc42 # 2 ( VHS40393 , Stealth siRNA , Life Technologies ) or AP - 2 ( AP2M1HSS101955 Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) , and a Medium GC Duplex RNA ( Stealth RNAi , Invitrogen ) served as the negative control . Transfections for transient expression of plasmids ( 16\u00b14 h ) and siRNA ( 60 \u2013 96 h ) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer \u2019 s recommendations . Protein expression levels were analysed in cleared cell lysates by western blotting and HRP or IRDye antigen detection using a Medical X - ray Processor ( Kodak ) or an Odyssey Sa reader ( LI - COR Biosciences ) , respectively . Cellular uptake and drug treatments To capture cargo uptake after a given time interval , cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with fluorescently labelled CTxB ( 3 \u03bc g / ml ) , transferrin ( 2 \u03bc g / ml ) or 4193 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2015 ) 128 , 4183 - 4195 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 174417 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e dextran ( 2 mg / ml ) and washed in preheated medium before fixation . For the quantification of internalised IRDye - S - S - linked cargo , cells seeded in 24 - well plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 8 \u03bc g / ml 800CW - S - S - transferrin or 0 . 18 mg / ml 800CW - S - S - aminodextran and washed in preheated medium before fixation . At room temperature , the samples were washed in stripping buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 7 , 100 mM NaCl , and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 ) , reduced for 1 . 5 h in the same buffer supplemented with 60 mM MesNa and further washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Cells were finally stained with 1 \u03bc M DRAQ5 for 30 min and washed in PBS before recording probe fluorescence using the Odyssey Sa reader . The uptake was defined as the ratio between the cell number ( the measured DRAQ5 fluorescence ) and the amount of internalised cargo ( the measured 800CW fluorescence ) . Cargo trafficking was also monitored by live - cell fluorescent microscopy directly after the addition of 3 \u03bc g / ml CTxB \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 647 or after 5 min of incubation with 0 . 5 \u2013 2 mg / ml dextran \u2013 Alexa - Fluor - 555 followed by a wash with preheated medium . The effects of actin polymerisation drugs on GRAF1 structures were analysed by fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells after treatment with 2 \u03bc M cytochalasin D , 2 \u03bc M latrunculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 \u03bc M wiskostatin ( Calbiochem ) or DMSO . Fluorescence microscopy Cellswerefixedandpreparedforimmunofluorescence analysisaspreviously described ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Images of fixed cell samples were captured using an epifluorescence Axioimager Z1 system ( AxioCam MRm camera ) ( Zeiss ) with the ZEN Software and a 63\u00d7 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil DIC 0 . 17 ) or an A1 R Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope system ( ANDOR iXon EMCCD camera ) ( Nikon Instruments ) under control of the NIS - Elements Microscope Imaging Software and a 60\u00d7 lens ( Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil \u03bb S 0 . 17 WD 0 . 14 , Nikon ) , at the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths . Live - cell confocal movies were recorded using the 63\u00d7 lens in the Nikon system or the 63\u00d7 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 Oil DIC M27 ) in a Cell Observer Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope system ( ANDOR iXon Ultra ) ( Zeiss ) controlled by the ZEN Software . Real - time TIRF acquisitions were captured byemploying the 100\u00d7 lens in respective system [ Apochromat 1 . 49 Oil 0 . 13 - 0 . 20 DIC N2 ( Nikon ) or Plan - Apochromat 1 . 46 Oil DIC M27 ( Zeiss ) ] . Micrographs and the acquired movies were prepared ( cropped , rotated , linearly adjusted for intensity and converted ) using Adobe Photoshop or ImageJ . Correlative microscopy For correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy , cells were high - pressure frozen on sapphire discs ( 0 . 7 % low - melt agarose and DMEM ; HPM100 ) and processed by freeze substitution . 250 - \u00b5m sections were placed on 200 mesh copper grids with a carbon support film ( TAAB ) and immediately imaged by epifluorescence microscopy , with all above steps performed according to Kukulski et al . ( 2011 , 2012 ) . Grids were further dried , coated with 15 - nm gold particles conjugated to protein A ( BioCell ) and post - stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate . Grids were placed in a high - tilt dual - axis holder ( Fischione Instruments ) and electron tomograms corresponding to the fluorescent structures of interest ( determined from recorded grid positions ) were acquired using a Tecnai F30 electron microscope ( FEI ) at 300 kV , equipped with an Eagel 4 k CCD camera ( FEI ) using serial electron microscopy ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . The 9400\u00d7 magnification tomograms were acquired as single - axis and the 15 , 500\u00d7 magnification tomograms as dual - axis tilt series over \u2212 60\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 ( 1 . 5\u00b0 increment ) . All tomograms were reconstructed , modelled and quantified with the IMOD package version 4 . 7 . 10 ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . The 15 , 500\u00d7 magnification tomograms used for the detailed models have a voxel size of 7 . 67 \u00c5 . Fluorescent micrographs , models and tomograms were overlaid using Adobe Photoshop . Image analysis and quantifications Protein bands on western blots detected with HRP - conjugated antibodies were determined from scanned images in ImageJ to derive the relative sample protein content . Estimations of the fraction of fixed cells with GFP \u2013 GRAF1 proteins in abundant or tubular structures were performed by epifluorescent visual assessment . The Imaris Software V7 . 5 ( Bitplane ) was utilised to analyse micrographs captured from fixed and live - cell samples as specified in Table S3 . The recruitment of GRAF1 \u2013 GFP to mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 membrane domains was analysed by comparing the fluorescence intensity profiles of each channel over time , from the live - cell confocal spinning disc acquisitions . The mean intensity value within a five - unit - diameter circular ROI , spanning each structure of interest , was obtained for each channel and frame using the \u2018 Plot Z - axis profile \u2019 tool in ImageJ . The start and end of each intensity peak were defined as the time points where the calculated mean intensity values rose above and declined below , respectively , the background . Parameters of GFP \u2013 GRAF1 and mCherry \u2013 Cdc42 - Q61L carriers calculated from the correlative microscopy were derived from measurements on the constructed 3D image using the IMOD package . Statistics Statistical tests were performed using Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software ) with the indicated sample size and number of independent experiments .

Cortactin is known to activate Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization and interact with dynamin , a large GTPase and proline rich domain - containing protein . Transferrin endocytosis was significantly reduced in cells by knock - down of cortactin expression as well as in vivo introduction of cortactin immunoreagents . Cortactin - dynamin interaction displayed morphologically dynamic co - distribution with a change in the endocytosis level in cells treated with an actin depolymerization reagent , cytochalasin D . In an in vitro beads assay , a branched actin network was recruited onto dynamin - coated beads in a cortactin Src homology domain 3 ( SH3 ) - dependent manner . In addition , cortactin was found to function in the late stage of clathrin coated vesicle formation . Taken together , cortactin is required for optimal clathrin mediated endocytosis in a dynamin directed manner .

In this process , coated vesicle formation is an essential step , known as a dynamic membrane activity mediated by the large GTPase dynamin [ 4 \u2212 11 ] . A number of Src - homology domain containing proteins are implicated in coated vesicle formation through interac - tion with the carboxy - terminal proline - rich domain of dynamin . These accessory proteins , including Grb2 [ 12 ] , intersectin [ 13 ] , endophilin [ 14 ] , syndaptin I [ 15 ] , amphiphysin I [ 16 ] , amphiphysin II [ 17 ] , profilin [ 18 ] and mammalian Abp1 [ 19 ] , either recruit dynamin or are recruited by dynamin to activate dynamin GTPase activity and function in clathrin coated pit invagination and scission . Actin cytoskeleton implicated in endocytosis is a well - grounded concept . Recent studies indicated that dynamin , rather than being a mechano - enzyme , may instead activate a downstream mediator of fission in clathrin coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation [ 20 ] . This highlights the importance of the actin skeleton as a potential mediator in power motion [ 20 ] . In fact , multiple proteins binding to dynamin , such as syndapin I , profilin and mAbp1 , interact with actin or regulate actin assembly . Recently , cortactin , an actin - binding partner and direct substrate of Src tyrosine kinase , was found to be a dynamin - binding protein [ 21 ] . Morphological findings in the ultrastructural level indicated that cortactin was distributed over the surface or base of clathrin lattices , as well as actin filaments associated with the pits [ 22 ] . Cortactin contains an N - terminal acidic domain that binds to actin - related protein complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) that mediates actin polymerization [ 23 , 24 ] . In addition , cortactin has a unique structure that features 6 . 5 tandem repeats and a carboxy - terminal Src homology domain 3 ( SH3 ) domain that form the F - actin binding domain and the dynamin binding region , respectively [ 21 , 23 ] . Here , we demonstrate that normal cortactin level in cells is required for optimal clathrin mediated endocytosis . Unlike lamellipodia and cortical ruffles , dynamin recruits cortactin to endocytic sites during the process in an actin - dependent fashion . To address further the role of cortactin in CCV formation , we used a functional assay for CCV formation to determine the hierarchy by which cortactin is targeted to and acts in coated pit invagination and scission . We found that cortactin plays an important role in CCV fission from plasma membranes . This study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence of the dynamin - directed function 96 Acta Biochim Biophys Sin Vol . 38 , No . 2 \u00a9Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , SIBS , CAS of cortactin in endocytosis , suggesting that cortactin may act as an adaptor in downstream CCV scission . Materials and Methods DNA constructs and recombinant proteins The cDNAs encoding cortactin and mutant cortactin D ( 1 \u2212 80 ) , cortactin D ( 1 \u2212 193 ) and cortactin D ( 1 \u2212 352 ) were generated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using the murine cortactin complementary DNA ( pXZ112 ) [ 23 , 25 ] as a template , and were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pCMV - tag2A ( Stratagene , La Jolla , USA ) downstream of a flag epitope tag . To construct red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) - tagged cortactin ( RFP - Cort ) , SH3 domain - deleted cortactin ( RFP - Cort \u2206 SH3 ) and SH3 domain of cortactin ( RFP - Cort - SH3 ) , cDNAs encoding wild - type cortactin , cortactin without SH3 domain , and SH3 domain only of cortactin were generated as Eco RI - Bam HI fragments using pXZ112 as a PCR template , and were further subcloned into mammalian expression vector pDsRed - Express - N1 ( Clontech , San Jose , USA ) . cDNA encoding proline rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin 2 was PCR - amplified using full - length dynamin 2 plasmid ( Dyn - GFP ) ( a gift from Dr . MCNIVEN , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , USA ) as a template , and subcloned into expression vector pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech ) . For purification of dynamin - PRD protein ( Dyn - PRD ) , the cDNA fragment of PRD of dynamin was inserted into pGEX - 4T2 plasmid at Eco RI / Xho I sites . The generated plasmid was transferred into DE3 . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was purified by a two - step procedure , as described previously [ 23 ] . To prepare recombinant GST - cortactin , GST - cortactin D ( 1 \u2212 80 ) , GST - Cort - SH3 and GST - Cort \u2206 SH3 , cDNAs encoding corresponding fragments were inserted into pGEX - 2T vector at Eco RI / Bam HI sites . The detailed methods for preparation of GST - cortactin derivates and GST - free proteins have been described previously [ 26 ] . Cortactin small RNA interference Cortactin siRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for the Silencer siRNA construction kit ( Ambion , Austin , USA ) . The day before transfection , cells were seeded into 6 - well plates at a density of 8 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well . The procedure for siRNA ( 50 \u00b5 M ) transfection into live cells was carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for Lipofectamine transfection ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , USA ) . Twenty four hours after transfection , cells were subjected to other experiments . The extent of cortactin knock - down was determined by immunoblot assay . As a control , siRNA against green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was transfected into cells as a mock - treatment . DNA transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy MDA - MB - 231 , 3T3 - L1 cells and NIH / 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC ( Maryland , USA ) . Cells were cotransfected with Dyn - GFP ( or Dyn - PRD - GFP ) and RFP - Cort ( or RFP - Cort - SH3 , RFP - Cort \u2206 SH3 ) using the Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Cells for further experiments were recovered for 24 \u2212 48 h after DNA transfection . For immunofluorescence microscopy , cells were either permeabilized with P - buffer ( 0 . 02 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 M Mes , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 4 % PEG8000 ) for 10 s or directly fixed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , then blocked with 2 . 5 % bovine serum albumin - phosphate - buffered saline ( BSA - PBS ) . After immunostaining , cells were viewed using an inverted Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000 - U with a digital camera controlled by Nikon ACT - 1 V . 2 . 51 software ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Visual inspection and biochemical assay of transferrin uptake Cells were incubated with 10 \u00b5 g / ml Oregon green labeled transferrin . The percentages of cells showing normal levels of internalized transferrin were determined by visual inspection in three independent experiments . Cells treated with BioPORTER ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , USA ) to introduce immunoreagents were subjected to ELISA - based endocytosis assay . The BioPORTER introduction of immunoreagents was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Capture - ELISA assay to measure endocytic transferrin was performed exactly as described [ 20 , 27 ] . Biotinylated human transferrin ( 10 \u00b5 g / ml ) was used in this assay . Each assay point was performed in duplicate . Analysis of the interaction between cortactin and PRD of dynamin Cortactin was incubated with GST - Dyn - PRD immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose at different concentrations . After incubation , samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and analyzed by immunoblot using cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ) . The densities of cortactin bands shown on the blot , which represented unbound cortactin , were scanned Feb . , 2006 Li CHEN et al . : Role of Cortactin , an Actin Polymerization Mediator , in Cell Endocytosis 97 http : / / www . abbs . info ; www . blackwellpublishing . com / abbs and quantified with Scion image software and normalized to the percentage of depletion . For pull - down assay of the interaction of the GST - Dyn - PRD with cortactin , GST - Dyn - PRD or GST was immobilized to glutathione - Sepharose . The beads were incubated with a cell lysate of NIH / 3T3 in lysis buffer at 4 \u00baC for 2 h . The proteins that bound on beads were then fractionated and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblot . Actin branching bead assay Fluorescent carboxylated polystyrene beads were coated with GST - Dyn - PRD by incubating beads in protein solution ( 5 mg / ml ) in room temperature for 2 h . The extent of protein coating was examined by immunoblot assay using GST antibody . Beads were washed twice with the 1 \u00d7 actin polymerization buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 3 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl , , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 0 . 25 mM ATP ) and stored at 4 \u00baC . Actin branching assay was based on the method described previously [ 28 ] . Cell - free assay for CCV formation Rat brain cytosol was prepared exactly as previously described [ 29 ] . The cell - free internalization assay using perforated 3T3 - L1 cells was performed based on previously described methods [ 29 , 30 ] . 3T3 - L1 cells were first washed in KSHM ( 100 mM potassium acetate , 85 mM sucrose , 20 mM HEPES and 1 mM magnesium acetate ) , and subjected to permeabilization . Cells were then scraped from the culture dish and washed in 15 ml KSHM before centrifugation . Cells were permeabilized more than 90 % as assessed by Trypan blue , and then incubated in KSHM containing 5 \u00b5 g / ml B - SS - transferrin ( Tfn ) and 0 . 5 % BSA . The final assay mixture contains 10 \u00b5 l of permeabilized cell suspension and 30 \u00b5 l cytosol with interested protein ( cortactin ) and ATP generating system . The reaction was initiated at 37 \u00baC for 30 min and stopped by returning to ice . Then the sample was washed with cold KSHM and the pellets were subjected to sodium 2 - mercaptoethanesulfonate ( MesNa ) resistance assay by ELISA , according to method described [ 30 ] . Results Cortactin is required for clathrin - mediated endocytosis We applied cortactin RNA and interference technique to MDA - MB - 231 cells , a breast cancer cell line in which cortactin is usually overexpressed , to directly examine the effect of cortactin on transferrin uptake . As shown in Fig . 1 ( A ) , after cortactin siRNA treatment , the expres - sion of cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 cells was dramatically reduced to trace level . While GFP knock - down as a mock treatment had no effect on transferrin uptake , knock - down Fig . 1 Knock - down of cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 cells attenuates transferrin endocytosis ( A ) Cortactin protein in siRNA treated cells was not detected by immunoblot assay . ( B ) Only about 50 % of cells subjected to cortactin siRNA treatment had normal transferrin ( Tfn ) uptake . ( C ) Tfn fluorescent intensity in cytoplasm in cortactin siRNA treated - cells was apparently reduced ( lower panel , arrow head ) in comparison to neighboring cells with relatively high cortactin levels ( lower panel , arrow ) , or to mock - treated cells ( upper panel ) .

However , cortactin RNA interference had no effect on fluid - phase endocytosis of dextran ( data not shown ) . As an additional approach to interfere with cortactin function in vivo , we introduced anti - cortactin immunoreagents into MDA - MB - 231 cells using the BioPORTER system . While incubation with BioPORTER alone did not lead to impairment in endocytosis , introduction of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibody of cortactin caused an apparent attenuation of transferrin uptake . As depicted in Fig . 2 , based on capture - ELISA - based internalization assay , introduction of cortactin immunoreagents resulted in a 30 % \u2212 60 % reduction in transferrin uptake . The control performed with rabbit IgG or labeled IgG failed to show any effects on endocytosis . Association of cortactin with dynamin at endocytosis sites in an actin - dependent manner We applied cytochalasin D , known to cause perturba - tion on actin polymerization , to live NIH / 3T3 cells , and observed the variation of the association between cortactin Fig . 3 Perturbation of actin dynamics by cytochalasin D affects the association of cortactin with dynamin at endocytosis sites NIH / 3T3 cells were treated with cytochalasin D in serum - free medium . The association of cortactin ( red ) with dynamin ( green ) was obvious in control cells without cytochalasin D treatment ( A ) , and became invisible after cytochalasin D exposure ( B ) , then was restored after the drug was washed out ( C ) . Compared with the control ( D ) , transferrin ( green ) endocytosis was reduced by cytochalasin D treatment for 1 h ( E ) and restored within 1 h after the drug was washed out ( F ) . Magnification , 600 \u00d7 . Fig . 2 Introduction of cortactin immunoreagents into live cells suppresses transferrin uptake NIH / 3T3 cells were subjected to cortactin immunoreagent introduction medi - ated by the BioPORTER - resistance system . Quantitation of endocytic biotin - labeled transferrin ( Tfn ) by ELISA - based transferrin uptake assay was performed 5 h after the start of the treatment . BioPORTER only ( column 1 ) , rabit IgG ( column 4 ) and labeled mouse IgG ( column 5 ) with kit were used as control . Endocytosis in cells with either cortactin antibody 001 ( column 2 ) or 4F11 ( column 3 ) was impaired . and dynamin as well as the alteration of transferrin endocytosis . Dynamin antibody was used to label the dynamin in endocytosis sites [ 31 , 32 ] . As shown in Fig . 3 , Feb . , 2006 Li CHEN et al . : Role of Cortactin , an Actin Polymerization Mediator , in Cell Endocytosis 99 http : / / www . abbs . info ; www . blackwellpublishing . com / abbs after exposure to 10 \u00b5 M cytochalasin D for 1 h , transferrin endocytosis in NIH / 3T3 cells was apparently impaired in accompaniment with submerging of the cortactin fluorescent signal which was associated with dynamin , while the dynamin signal at the sites seemed unaffected . Interestingly , we noticed the return of the colocalization of cortactin with dynamin after drug washing - out . In the meantime , the endocytosis was restored as well . Active recruitment of cortactin to endocytosis sites by dynamin through its proline rich domain Transfected NIH / 3T3 cells were subjected to pulse exposure to transferrin for 10 min . Results from multiple - color staining showed that dynamin and cortactin colocalized exactly with AP - 2 in granular structures ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating those structures were endocytosis - related . This colocalization was also observed in cortactin SH3 domain - expressing cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Remarkably , the colocalization was abolished between SH3 domain - deleted cortactin and dynamin or between wild - type cortactin and PRD - depleted dynamin , while the colocalization between PRD - deleted dynamin or wild - type dynamin and AP - 2 in cytoplasm was unchanged ( Fig . 4 ) . In the in vitro experiment , we observed that the affinity of Dyn - PRD to cortactin represented by an apparent K d value was less than 1 \u00b5 M , which supported the notion that Dyn - PRD could substantially pull down cortactin from quiescent NIH / 3T3 total lysate ( Fig . 5 ) . Notably , in the actin branching experiment , cortactin - mediated actin branching could hatch around Dynn - PRD coated beads . This phenomenon was abolished once an SH3 - depleted cortactin was in place of the wild - type cortactin . Based on all of these results , we believe that dynamin would be first localized to endocytosis sites followed by recruit - ment of cortactin through the interaction of Dyn - PRD with the Cort - SH3 domain , and this event was naturally accompanied by actin assembly . In fact , according to a recent study , imaging of actin and dynamin recruitment in the early stage of endocytosis showed that a burst of dynamin recruitment was an earlier event than actin recruitment to the endocytosis area [ 20 ] . Cortactin functions at the late stage of CCV formation We continuously investigated the role of cortactin in CCV formation , an essential course in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , by virtue of a cell free functional assay [ 30 , 33 ] using 3T3 - L1 cells [ 29 ] , which normally express cortactin . In this assay , transferrin biotinylated via a cleavable disulphide bond ( B - SS - Tfn ) binds to its receptor in perforated cells and is further sequestered into deeply invaginated coated pits and internalized into coated vesicles in a cytosol - and ATP - dependent manner [ 27 , 30 , 33 , 34 ] . In the present work , we prepared rat brain cytosol in which cortactin protein was almost completely depleted with cortactin antibody [ Fig . 6 ( A ) ] . While cortactin alone has no effect on CCV formation in the absence of cytosol , cortactin - depleted cytosol displayed inhibitory activity on the process . Based on MesNa resistance assay , B - SS - Tfn internalization , which reflected the amount of CCV formation , was reduced in the presence of cortactin - depleted cytosol . Addition of recombined cortactin protein in cytosol dramatically restored B - SS - Tfn internalization . However , preincubating of the membrane with N - terminal - deleted cortactin or Cort - SH3 domain exhibited distinct effects on rescuing the reduction of B - SS - Tfn internali - zation by cortactin depletion . Addition of cortactin SH3 domain resulted in a further inhibition of CCV formation . Notably , when N - terminal - deleted cortactin was added , the restoration of CCV formation amounted to 70 % of that produced by full - length cortactin ( Fig . 6 ) , indicating N - terminal - deleted cortactin was less efficient than the wild - type cortactin . Discussion In the present study we further examined the function of cortactin , an actin binding partner encoded by the EMS1 oncogene , in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and its relationship with dynamin in the process . We initiated this study based on the understanding of the relationship between cytoskeleton and endocytosis [ 35 \u2212 40 ] and the morphological findings that cortactin associated with clathrin coated pits and endosomal vesicles [ 22 , 41 ] , and that cortactin is known as a potent mediator of actin nucleation [ 23 ] . We first combined the application of cortactin siRNA and immunoreagents introduction into live cells to perturb the function of cortactin in cells . We demonstrated that interference of cortactin function in cells could result in the impairment of transferrin endocytosis ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . This result is consistent with the findings that microinjection of anti - cortactin antibodies into living cells inhibited endocytosis [ 22 ] . Based on these results we believe that cortactin plays a substantial role in consti - tutive endocytosis , however , so far the detailed function of this molecule in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has not been fully elucidated . The large GTPase dynamin is a crucial component of endocytosis machinery which was known as a mechano - 100 Acta Biochim Biophys Sin Vol . 38 , No . 2 \u00a9Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology , SIBS , CAS Fig . 4 In vivo recruitment of cortactin to endocytosis sites by dynamin NIH / 3T3 cells were seeded on fibronectin - coated coverslips the day before DNA transfection . Cotransfection was performed using Lipofectamine reagent . Red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) - cortactin ( A ) , dynamin - green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ( B ) and AP - 2 ( C ) co - distributed in cytoplasm and formed granular structure ( D ) . In cells cotransfected with RFP - tagged wild - type cortactin ( E ) and proline rich domain ( PRD ) depleted dynamin ( F ) , the association of cortactin with dynamin and AP - 2 ( G ) was abolished ( H ) . This phenomenon also happened in cells cotransfected with SH3 domain - deleted cortactin and wild - type dynamin . Unlike wild - type cortactin , RFP - Cort \u2206 SH3 ( I ) is not associated with dynamin ( J ) and AP - 2 ( K ) any more , while the latter two still co - distributed in cytoplasm ( L ) . In cortactin SH3 domain only expressing cells , RFP - tagged cortactin SH3 ( M ) , GFP - tagged wild - type dynamin ( N ) and AP - 2 ( O ) were co - distributed as puncta - like structure in cytoplasm ( P ) . When cells were cotransfected with cortactin SH3 and PRD - depleted dynamin , cortactin SH3 domain ( Q ) lost its association with PRD - depleted dynamin ( R ) and AP - 2 ( S ) , while PRD - depleted dynamin - AP - 2 co - distribution was still present ( T ) . Cells expressing RFP ( U ) and wild - type dynamin ( V ) were used as the control , no colocalization was found ( X ) , and the colocalization between dynamin and AP - 2 was not affected by GFP expression ( W , X ) .

J Cell Biol 2000 , 151 : 187 \u2212 198 enzyme functioning in the initial stage of endocytosis [ 4 \u2212 10 , 35 , 37 , 42 ] . Dynamin directly associates with cortactin through the proline rich domain of dynamin and the SH3 domain of cortactin [ 21 ] . This interaction was expansively reflected by their co - distribution in lamellipodia and ruffles , induced membrane waves , podosomes and actin tails of vesicles [ 21 , 32 , 43 ] , and was always accompanied by actin rearrangement . Thus , we further examined the effect of actin dynamics on the association of dynamin and cortactin in endocytosis sites which was probed by the anti - dynamin antibody Hudy 1 [ 31 , 32 ] . Unexpectedly , when NIH / 3T3 cells were treated with an actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D for 1 h , the association of cortactin with dynamin became invisible , but was restored in less than 1 h after cytochalasin D was washed out ( Fig . 3 ) . It was demonstrated that the association of cortactin with dynamin in endocytosis sites could not be dependent on actin dynamics , in which cortactin was found to play a modulator role [ 23 , 24 ] . This result also implied that the localization of cortactin to endocytic required interaction with F - actin via dynamin . In order to fully understand the function of cortactin - dynamin association in endocytosis sites , it is necessary to know the dynamics of this interaction . We thus performed a further experiment in vivo and established a system in vitro to demonstrate the recruitment between cortactin and dynamin . Based on the results from these two approaches , cortactin appears to be passively recruited by dynamin to endocytosis - related sites ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Interestingly , branched actin filaments could be partially recruited to dynamin PRD coated beads , which was abolished when mutant cortactin with no SH3 domain was in place of the wild - type one ( Fig . 5 ) . This is consistent with the cell staining results . To investigate if cortactin is implicated at an early stage of endocytosis , we used a functional assay based on a cell - free system that analyzes initial events immediately after membrane invagination . As a result , we prepared rat brain cytosol extract treated with an anti - cortactin antibody , which depleted cortactin proteins completely but had no effect on actin in the extract . The cortactin - depleted extract was incubated with 3T3 - L1 cells . The extract without cortactin induced CCV formation poorly with an efficiency approximately 60 % less than that of the mock - treated extract . Furthermore , adding a recom - binant wild - type cortactin resulted in a 90 % restoration of CCV formation ( Fig . 6 ) . These data demonstrate that cortactin is essential for optimal cell endocytosis , which involves a dynamin - directed interaction in the early stage of CCV formation .

Introduction Endocytosis provides a crucial and dynamic interface between the extracellular milieu and the interior of the cell . This interface is paramount for fluid and nutrient uptake , signaling regulation , lipid homeostasis , plasma membrane ( PM ) remodeling , synaptic vesicle recycling , and cellular motility ( Grande - Garc\u00eda et al . , 2007 ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ; Idone et al . , 2008b ; Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . Correspondingly , the endocytic system entails a rich diversity of mechanisms coordinated across several pathways . Mounting evidence suggests that eukaryotic cells maintain up to five distinct , constitutive pinocytic pathways ( excluding A lthough the importance of clathrin - and caveolin - independent endocytic pathways has recently emerged , key aspects of these routes remain un - known . Using quantitative ultrastructural approaches , we show that clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) ac - count for approximately three times the volume internal - ized by the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway , forming the major pathway involved in uptake of fluid and bulk membrane in fibroblasts . Electron tomographic analysis of the 3D morphology of the earliest carriers shows that they are multidomain organelles that form a complex sorting station as they mature . Proteomic analysis pro - vides direct links between CLICs , cellular adhesion turn - over , and migration . Consistent with this , CLIC - mediated endocytosis of key cargo proteins , CD44 and Thy - 1 , is polarized at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts , while transient ablation of CLICs impairs their ability to migrate . These studies provide the first quantitative ultra - structural analysis and molecular characterization of the major endocytic pathway in fibroblasts , a pathway that provides rapid membrane turnover at the leading edge of migrating cells . Clathrin - independent carriers form a high capacity endocytic sorting system at the leading edge of migrating cells Mark T .

Generic en - docytic markers that enter via CME , caveolae , and CIE routes , such as HRP or CTxB , have been used in conjunction with ultra - structural morphology and dynamin independence to define CLICs ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we first used HRP - conjugated CTxB ( CTxB - HRP ) as an endocytic membrane marker with a previously characterized diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) incubation protocol for EM visualization ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . This method reveals only internalized carriers and can be used to label such carriers within seconds of scission . Although CTxB - HRP is an excellent membrane marker , a multivalent toxin could theoretically affect endocytosis , particularly when combined with an incubation step at low temperature ( R\u00f6mer et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , quantitative measurements of the very early uptake of the fluid phase marker , HRP ( at 20 mg . ml 2 1 ) , were compared with CTxB - HRP and assessed in the presence or absence of unlabeled CTxB ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) to determine the relative contribution of CME and CLICs in both wild - type ( WT ) and caveolin1 - null ( Cav1 2 / 2 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) . These experiments allowed us to eliminate a cold step and showed that HRP and CTxB - HRP labeled identical compart - ments , whereas CTxB did not quantitatively affect endocytosis ( Fig . 1 , C \u2013 E ) . A defining characteristic of the CLIC pathway is indepen - dence of dynamin for PM scission ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we used a well - characterized small molecule inhibi - tor of dynamin , dynasore ( unpublished data ) , as well as a more potent , hydroxylated analogue of dynasore , Dyngo4a ( unpub - lished data ) to inhibit CME , caveolar endocytosis , and dynamin - dependent CIE pathways . The activity of these inhibitors in WT and Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs was confirmed by assessing the fluorescence uptake of the CME cargo protein transferrin ( Tf - 647 ) and the generic endocytic marker CTxB - 555 ( Fig . 1 F ) , as well as visu - alization of CTxB - HRP \u2013 labeled carriers by EM ( Fig . 1 G ) . Although Tf - 647 and CTxB - 555 were both efficiently internal - ized in untreated control cells , after treatment with 30 \u00b5M Dyngo4a ( or 80 \u00b5M dynasore ) only CTxB - 555 internaliza - tion occurred . In agreement with this observation , in untreated control cells , CTxB - HRP labeling was found in both CLICs ( Fig . 1 G , arrows ) and clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ; Fig . 1 G , double arrowheads ) , visualized by EM . However , in the pres - ence of Dyngo4a , only CLICs , defined by ultrastructure , were active ( Fig . 1 G , arrows ) . Unlabeled clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) were readily observed but were surface connected ( Fig . 1 G , arrowheads ) . Together , these data show that CTxB is a useful marker for CLICs and , when combined with acute dynamin inhibition using Dyngo4a , CLICs remain the only detectably active endocytic pathway . phagocytosis and macropinocytosis ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . These are clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , caveolae , and three noncaveolar clathrin - independent endocytic ( CIE ) routes , which are defined based on specific regulation by RhoA ( Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) , Arf6 ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 ) , or Cdc42 ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . Many of the cargo and regula - tors of the classical CME and caveolae pathways have been identi - fied and the dynamics of these pathways are the best understood ( for reviews see Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Parton and Simons , 2007 ) . Comparatively , very little is known about the mechanisms governing CIE , although recent work has emphasized the crucial importance of these pathways ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . The existence of CIE pathways was first proposed from the study of plant and bacterial toxin internalization , in combi - nation with ultrastructural methods or with tools that inhibited CME ( Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Sandvig et al . , 1987 ; Ricci et al . , 2000 ) . The plant toxin ricin was used to first describe the clathrin - independent , apical endocytic pathway in endothelial cells ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1994 ) . Bacterial toxins , such as the Helicobacter pylori VacA toxin ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) and chol - era toxin ( Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) provided further evidence for clathrin - independent endocytic pathways . However , a lack of specific tools to study these noncanonical routes has made it difficult to identify their guiding parameters . Ultrastructural work on the CIE pathway regulated by Cdc42 has identified the morphologically distinct clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) as the primary carriers involved in uptake within this route ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . Parameters currently identified for the CLIC pathway include dynamin - independent PM scission ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , enrichment in GPI - anchored proteins ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , reliance on Arf1 activity ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) , sensitivity to cholesterol depletion ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Chadda et al . , 2007 ) , and contribution to a significant fraction of cholera toxin B subunit ( CTxB ) and fluid internalization ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . CLICs arise directly from the PM and mature into the GPI - enriched early endosomal compartment ( GEEC ) , as they acquire Rab5 and EEA - 1 and , consequently , merge with early endosomes ( EEs ; Kalia et al . , 2006 ) . Ongoing work is linking cargo and regulators to these carriers , such as GTPase regulator associated with FAK ( GRAF1 ) , dysferlin , and Snx9 ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ; Hern\u00e1ndez - Deviez et al . , 2008 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . The basic parameters of these carriers , however , remain unknown . Here we characterize key parameters of the CLIC pathway . A quantitative analysis of the volume and surface area of CLICs identifies them as the major constitutive pathway involved in bulk endocytosis within fibroblasts . High resolution electron to - mography shows the complexity of these primary endocytic car - riers and , in conjunction with recruitment of classical trafficking regulators , they are realized to be intricate sorting compartments . Identification of novel CLIC cargo suggests links to cellular ad - hesion turnover and plasma membrane repair . Consistent with this , CLICs become polarized in migrating fibroblasts , turning over adhesion complex components , such as Thy - 1 and CD44 , at the leading edge . Inhibition of the CLIC pathway subsequently impairs the capacity of fibroblasts to migrate .

By measuring the surface - to - volume ratio ( S ( v ) ; see Materials and methods ) of a typical CLIC ( Fig . 2 F ) and the absolute volume of an average Cav1 2 / 2 MEF ( 2 , 346 . 7 \u00b1 289 . 3 \u00b5m 3 ; see Materials and meth - ods ) , the compiled membrane surface area of CLICs was calcu - lated after 15 s of internalization to be 97 . 1 \u00b1 10 . 9 \u00b5m 2 . Given that the estimated average PM surface area of a Cav1 2 / 2 MEF was found to be 4 , 375 . 7 \u00b5m 2 ( see Materials and methods ) , the equivalent of the total PM surface area could internalize through CLICs in less than 12 min ( or 17 min after most extreme correc - tion factor ; see Materials and methods ) . Together these data indicate that CLICs provide a substantial capacity of internal - ization , more than any other constituite endocytic pathway in fibroblast cells . CLICs exhibit the properties of a complex sorting compartment Aside from the 2D morphological description of tubular CLICs , there is currently no data describing the 3D attributes of the pri - mary carriers . To comprehensively visualize the ultrastructural properties of CLICs , high resolution electron tomography was performed on CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden structures ( Fig . 3 A ; Video 1 ) . As a membrane marker , CTxB - HRP provided superior delinea - tion of membrane profiles compared with free HRP at the con - centrations and very early time points used here . CTxB - HRP was internalized for only 15 s to capture the earliest morphology of the carriers . The DAB reaction was performed on live cells to stabilize the morphology of the structures before glutaraldehyde fixation , simultaneously providing the necessary contrast for high resolution tomography and maintaining a close - to - native morphology . Morphology of DAB - labeled structures was simi - lar in cells fixed before DAB reaction ( not depicted ) . Images of 3D rendering from electron densities are shown ( Fig . 3 A ) . There is clear evidence of vesicular membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3 A , arrows ) , excluded from CTxB - HRP labeling , indicating that CLICs may have a capacity to bud internal membranes . Addi - tionally , the tubular structure forms a complete ring , a facet pre - viously overlooked ( Fig . 3 A , arrowhead ) . As chemical fixatives can alter the morphology of endosomes ( Murk et al . , 2003 ) , it was also important to confirm these observations without the use of aldehyde fixation . Therefore , CTxB - HRP was internalized for 15 s , DAB reaction performed , and the samples were high pres - sure frozen ( HPF ) as described previously ( Richter et al . , 2008 ) . HPF CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden CLICs showed identical features to chemically fixed samples ( Fig . 3 B ) , with vesicular invaginations from the limiting membrane and tubular ring - shaped extensions . Rather than simple tubules or vesicles , these primary carriers have a surprising degree of complexity . Identification of novel CLIC - associated proteins To identify CLIC associated components , we next sought to en - rich CLICs away from other cellular material by density gradi - ent fractionation ( see Materials and methods ) . To increase the number of CLICs within a population of cells , the PI 3 K inhibi - tor wortmannin was used within a previously developed system Having established the constitutive nature of the path - way and lack of detectable perturbation by the used markers , we used EM - based stereology to calculate the proportion of total cytoplasmic volume ( V ( v ) ) contributed by the CLIC pathway . We used both Cav1 2 / 2 and WT MEFs to compare cells with and without caveolae , as well as a fibroblast cell line , NIH3T3 ( Fig . 2 A ) . In untreated Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs , total CTxB - labeled structures occupied 0 . 10 \u00b1 0 . 01 % of the total cytoplasmic volume after 15 s of internalization , 0 . 19 \u00b1 0 . 01 % after 1 min , and 0 . 50 \u00b1 0 . 04 % after 2 min ( Fig . 2 B , Untreated ) . WT MEFs internalized similar volumes as Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs , in - dicating that caveolae contributed an insignificant proportion of internalization at this time . Intriguingly , when treated with Dyngo4a , under conditions where uptake of Tf is completely blocked and CLICs remain the only detectably active pathway , internalized CTxB - HRP still accounted for 0 . 09 \u00b1 0 . 01 % of cytoplasmic volume after 15 s , 0 . 16 \u00b1 0 . 02 % after 1 min , and 0 . 37 \u00b1 0 . 02 % after 2 min ( Fig . 2 B , Dyngo4a ) . This indicates that 90 . 0 % of the total endocytic volume is contributed by the CLIC pathway after 15 s of uptake , 85 . 9 % after 1 min , and 74 . 0 % after 2 min . Confirmation of such high contribution of CLICs to total internalization was provided using strict ultrastructural criteria to compare the volume of tubular / ring - shaped structures ( CLICs ) and coated / vesicular structures ( CCVs ) in NIH3T3 cells that were not treated with any inhibitor ( Fig . 2 C ) . Note that previ - ous studies have shown that at the earliest times used here , Tf - HRP only labels CCVs as defined morphologically ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) but CTxB - HRP labels CCVs , caveolae , and CLICs . NIH3T3 cells internalized similar volumes to primary MEFs , with total CTxB - labeled structures after 2 min accounting for 0 . 47 \u00b1 0 . 014 % of cytoplasmic volume and tubular / ring ele - ments ( CLICs ) contributing 78 . 7 % ( 0 . 37 \u00b1 0 . 014 % ) of that vol - ume ( Fig . 2 C ) . This alternative method avoids the need for inhibition of the dynamin - dependent pathways and suggests that under these conditions CLICs are not a compensatory pathway induced after acute dynamin inhibition ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . To confirm the striking contribution of the CLIC pathway to cellular internalization , V ( v ) measurements were next collected using free HRP , which cannot bind to mem - branes and induce clustering of microdomains ( Fig . 2 D ) . Again , CLICs , morphologically defined as tubules / rings , con - stituted \ue07a 74 % of all HRP internalization after 2 min ( V ( v ) 0 . 32 \u00b1 0 . 05 % ) . To further confirm these results using an alternative method for assessment of endocytic contribution , CTxB was biotinyl - ated and internalized in Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs , in the presence or ab - sence of Dyngo4a . Surface - accessible biotin was cleaved and the remaining , internalized biotin measured by Western blot using streptavidin - HRP . Using this alternative biochemcial method CTxB - biotin levels in Dyngo4a - treated cells were equivalent to 76 . 0 \u00b1 8 . 4 % of that in untreated control cells after 2 min of uptake ( Fig . 2 E ) . Agreement between morphometric and biochemcial approaches ( and with V ( v ) measurements using a specific marker of the CLIC pathway : see below ) provides important confirma - tion of the validity of the methods used and the significant mag - nitude of the CLIC pathway .

Therefore , colocalization between dynamin and anti - GFP in GFP - GPI \u2013 expressing cells was assessed after treatment with wortmannin ( Fig . S3 ) . Colocalization after 10 min was signifi - cantly increased in wortmannin - treated cells compared with untreated controls ( 13 . 1 \u00b1 1 . 1 % untreated ; 39 . 2 \u00b1 2 . 0 % 100 nM wortmannin ; Fig . S3 , A and B ) , indicating that dynamin is re - cruited to CLICs rather than localizing to them from the PM . By EM , dynamin was also found on a small proportion of CTxB - HRP containing tubular / ring - shaped structures ( Fig . S3 C ) . Although the majority of dynamin coincides with the CHC profile , the small but specific concentration in Fraction 2 . 8 , as well as colocalization with GFP - GPI and CTxB , is consistent with the hypothesis that dynamin is recruited to CLICs , after PM scission . To verify that membranes in Fraction 2 . 8 represent bona fide CLICs , 3T3 - GPI cells were transfected with one of two markers for the CLIC pathway , Flot1 - HA and GRAF1 - myc . By Western blot analysis both endogenous and transfected Flot1 and GRAF1 were concentrated in Fraction 2 . 8 ( Fig . 4 F ) . When fractions from transfected cells were labeled with anti - HA or anti - myc antibod - ies , a significant proportion of the structures within Fraction 2 . 8 were labeled ( Fig . 4 G , arrows ; 31 . 5 \u00b1 2 . 5 % Flot - HA and 41 . 3 \u00b1 6 . 4 % Graf1 - myc positive ) . Comparatively , when Fraction 2 . 8 was labeled for endogenous Cav1 , very few of the structures were pos - itive ( 5 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 8 % ) and , notably , these smaller vesicular structures were distinct from the CLIC - like structures ( Fig . 4 G , arrowheads ) . Endogenous dynamin labeled a significant population of struc - tures within Fraction 2 . 8 ( Fig . 4 G , arrows ; Fig . S3 D ) , supporting the notion that dynamin can associate with CLICs . We next used this fractionation approach to identify novel CLIC components . The protein complement of Fraction 2 . 8 was examined after separation using 5 \u2013 15 % SDS - PAGE and the entire lane was cut into 2 - mm slices , digested with trypsin , and analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ; see Materials and methods ) . This identified 80 proteins with two or more peptide hits of 99 % confidence ( key targets and links to endocytosis in Table I , full list in Table S1 ) . A significant cluster of proteins identified play a role in cellular adhesion and inter - action with the ECM . Thy - 1 , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein ( GPI - AP ) , is a critical component of focal adhesion disassembly through FAK phosphorylation ( Rege et al . , 2006 ) . This interaction is dependent on the GPI anchor of Thy - 1 , implicating the GPI - AP \u2013 enriched CLIC pathway as a mediator of FAK activation . Integrin - \ue062 1 is also a key component of focal adhesions and galectin3 is directly involved in clathrin - independent integrin - \ue062 1 endocytosis ( Furtak et al . , 2001 ) . Although a role for CME during integrin - \ue062 1 endocytosis and cellular motility has been established ( Palamidessi et al . , 2008 ) , it has also been found that integrin - \ue062 1 uptake can be indepen - dent from clathrin and is mediated by lipid rafts ( Vassilieva et al . , 2008 ) . Rap1 transmits outside - in integrin signals , leading to cell polarization , and its activation at the leading edge is necessary for chemokine - induced cellular migration ( Shimonaka et al . , 2003 ) . CD98 also mediates integrin signaling during cell spreading and is localized to cell \u2013 cell contacts ( Feral et al . , 2005 ) , where it acti - vates Rap1 ( Suga et al . , 2001 ) . Activation of Rap1 also leads to recruitment of CD44 to the leading edge ( Shimonaka et al . , 2003 ) , that inhibits the fusion of CLICs with EEs ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ; Fig . S1 ) . Using anti - GFP in GFP - GPI \u2013 expressing NIH3T3 cells ( 3T3 - GPIs ) as a marker for CLICs , we optimized conditions to concentrate GFP - GPI \u2013 positive membranes ( Fraction 1 . 2 ; Fig . 4 A ) . CCVs ( identified by clathrin heavy chain ; CHC ) , EEs and recycling endosomes ( REs ; identified by TfR ) , and Golgi ( identified by GM130 ) were below the detection limits within this fraction . However , this fraction also contained Cav1 ( caveolae ) and Grp78 ( ER ) . The 10 % fraction ( Fraction 1 . 2 ) was , therefore , subjected to a second , continuous Nycodenz gradient , which pro - vided a reproducible enrichment of anti - GFP \u2013 positive mem - branes ( Fraction 2 . 8 ; Fig . 4 A ) . To further characterize the enriched fraction , we examined the membranes in detail by whole - mount EM ( Fig . 4 B ) . Consistent with CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden CLICs visualized by EM in intact cells ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) , the predominant structures within Fraction 2 . 8 have the striking mor - phology of CLICs . A low magnification image shows the consis - tent morphology of the structures enriched within this fraction ( Fig . S2 A ) . At high magnification ( Fig . 4 C , arrows ) , the struc - tures within Fraction 2 . 8 were also consistent with tomography and HPF data ( Fig . 3 ) . Other structures displayed a clear connec - tion between tubular extensions and spherical bulbs ( Fig . 4 C , arrowheads ) . There was no evidence of contamination by other cellular compartments , such as mitochondria . Other fractions were enriched in structures distinct from those found in Fraction 2 . 8 ( Fig . S2 C ) . This system also gave optimal , but incomplete , separation of GFP - GPI \u2013 positive carriers from Cav1 and Grp78 . To quantify the membrane enrichment in Fraction 2 . 8 we ana - lyzed internalized CTxB - HRP within the fraction after 5 min of internalization ( Fig . 4 D , arrows ) . CTxB - HRP \u2013 labeled structures constituted 70 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 9 % of the membranes in the CLIC - enriched fraction as calculated from stereology ( Fig . S2 B ) . The validity of this method was further examined by ana - lyzing membranes within Fraction 2 . 8 after inhibition of CLIC endocytosis . Using two independent methods of CLIC perturba - tion , expression of a Cdc42 dominant - negative mutant ( Cdc42 - DN ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) and cholesterol depletion with methyl - \ue062 - cyclodextrin ( m \ue062 CD ) under conditions where CME is unaffected ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Glebov et al . , 2006 ) , there was a substantial reduction of CTxB and anti - GFP \u2013 positive mem - branes within Fraction 2 . 8 ( Fig . 4 E ; 59 . 7 % reduction in CTxB levels in cells transfected with Cdc42 - DN compared with Cdc42 - WT ; 53 . 6 % reduction in anti - GFP antibody levels after treatment with m \ue062 CD ) . Thus , this approach shows concentra - tion of CLIC marker positive membranes within Fraction 2 . 8 and reduced accumulation of these membranes after treatments known to inhibit CLIC endocytosis . Unlike CHC and TfR , there was a small proportion of dynamin specifically concentrated in Fraction 2 . 8 ( Fig . 4 F ) . Although dynamin is not necessary for the formation of nascent CLICs ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) , it has been previously noted that expression of the DynK44A mutant re - duces CTxB trafficking to the Golgi ( Le and Nabi , 2003 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) , independently from clathrin ( Torgersen et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting a role in clathrin - independent CTxB uptake . As CLICs rapidly mature , however , it is difficult to assess a possible tran - sient recruitment of dynamin under steady - state conditions .

Anti \u2013 Thy - 1 , anti - CD44 , and myoferlin colocalized with CTxB - 555 but not Tf - 647 in NIH3T3 cells after 2 min of uptake , indicat - ing they are specific cargo for the CLIC pathway . Interestingly , although only a low level of colocalization was seen between anti - GFP and Rab11 after 10 min ( 17 . 07 \u00b1 1 . 49 % ) in untreated 3T3 - GPI cells ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) , after treatment with wortman - nin there was a significant increase in their colocalization after 10 min ( 41 . 12 \u00b1 2 . 79 % ; Fig . 5 , B and C ) . As wortmannin inhib - its the maturation of CLICs , this localization is not likely to occur within REs . Additionally , there was no detectable TfR in the CLIC - enriched fraction , arguing against significant contam - ination of RE membranes within this fraction . Additional evidence for the sorting capability of CLICs was identified by assessment of the endocytic maturation of CD44 . Endocytosis of CD44 was consistently Tf negative ( Fig . 5 D ) , while it colocalized with CTxB after 2 min , with less overlap after 10 min . Persistent colocalization was also seen be - tween CD44 and dysferlin from 2 to 40 min ( Fig . 5 D ) . As dys - ferlin also remains distinct from the classical endocytic network while CD44 is linked to integrin - \ue062 1 signaling by forming special - ized lipid raft microdomains ( Lee et al . , 2008 ) . CD44 is also an important component of extracellular contact , involved in the degradation of ECM , and is involved in maintenance of polar - ization and directionally persistent migration ( Mrass et al . , 2008 ) . This also implicates CLICs as a mediator of cell adhesion and , given the proposed ability for CLICs to recycle directly to the PM , presents a rapid recycling mechanism during cellular adhe - sion turnover and motility . Supporting this , moesin directs actin - based rearrangements of lipid rafts directly through CD44 to orchestrate the topology of cell surface structures , such as filopo - dia ( Bretscher et al . , 1997 ) , and the CD44 - ERM ( ezrin - radixin - moesin ) association is a critical component of directional cellular motility ( Legg et al . , 2002 ) . We next sought to verify some key targets as novel cargo for the CLIC pathway . Verification of novel CLIC proteins Preliminary verification of some key targets was performed by comparison to internalized CTxB - 555 and Tf - 647 ( Fig . 5 A ) . Table I .

To verify the polarization of CLIC endocytosis in migrat - ing fibroblasts , ultrastructure of CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden carriers was assessed after a 2 - min uptake in migrating MEFs ( Fig . 5 C , large arrow indicates direction of migration ) . Labeled CLICs were predominantly found at the leading edge ( Fig . 6 C ; 1 , 2 ) . Con - versely , an accumulation of unlabeled , surface - connected caveo - lae was seen at the trailing edge ( Fig . 6 C ; 3 , 4 insets ) . Quantitation of the number of endocytic and surface - connected structures at the leading and trailing edges confirmed this polarized distribu - tion ( Fig . 6 D ) . Both surface - connected CCPs and internalized CCVs showed no preference for the leading or trailing edge . To our knowledge , this is the first evidence for a striking spatial distinction between the CLIC pathway , caveolae , and CME , and is suggestive of a role for CLICs during dynamic adhesion turn - over specifically from the leading edge . As the CLIC pathway is polarized during migration and internalizes key adhesion components at the leading edge , we speculated that this pathway could play a critical role during cell migration . Thus , a system was developed in which CLIC - dependent uptake could be inhibited without affecting CME ( see Materials and methods ) . To optimize conditions for tran - sient ablation of the CLIC pathway , we internalized CTxB - HRP for various short times , performed DAB - mediated ablation of the labeled compartments , and then analyzed the uptake of a subsequent pulse of CTxB - 555 , Tf - 647 , and antibodies to CD44 . 2 min of CTxB - HRP internalization followed by the DAB reaction on living cells was found to give the strongest inhibition of CD44 and CTxB - 555 endocytosis without any effect on Tf - 647 uptake ( Fig . 6 E ) . Under these conditions Tf - 647 endocytosis and maturation was unaffected , even after a 40 - min pulse , indicating the endosomal network was still func - tional ( not depicted ) . The inhibition of CD44 and CTxB - 555 internalization following CTxB - HRP \u2013 based ablation persisted for at least 4 h after the ablation step , indicating this assay could be used to assess possible effects of CLIC inhibition on migration . Quantitation of fluorescence intensity shows that CTxB - HRP inactivation of the CLIC pathway resulted in an 81 . 8 \u00b1 7 . 2 % reduction in CTxB - 555 and a 93 . 8 \u00b1 2 . 6 % reduc - tion in CD44 endocytosis , whereas Tf - 647 internalization was not reduced ( increased by 28 . 6 \u00b1 24 . 8 % ) after a 4 - h incuba - tion ( Fig . 6 F ) . To test the requirement for CLIC endocytosis during mi - gration , this inactivation assay was applied to migrating fibro - blasts . The capacity of cell monolayers to migrate into a scratched wound was assessed by measuring the total distance between two cell fronts of a wound after CLIC inactivation . When CTxB - HRP was used to inactivate CLICs , without effect on other endo - cytic routes , cell monolayers had a reduced capacity to migrate into a wound after 4 h ( 15 . 8 \u00b1 1 . 7 % distance of wound closed ; Fig . 6 G ) compared with DAB only \u2013 treated cells ( 33 . 4 \u00b1 3 . 7 % closed ) . A similar effect was observed in Cav1 2 / 2 fibroblasts , ruling out the possibility that the migration defect was due to in - activation of caveolae . Together with previous studies ( Grande - Garc\u00eda et al . , 2007 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , these findings suggest that three major endocytic routes in eukaryotic cells , CME , caveolae , and the CLIC pathway , are all important for normal directional cell migration . ( not depicted ) , this suggests that CLICs are directly sorting cargo rather than representing distinct populations of similar mecha - nisms . Confirming this , the ultrastructure of CD44 - positive car - riers , as visualized using anti \u2013 CD44 - HRP , showed identical morphology to that of CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden CLICs ( Fig . 5 E , arrows ) , whereas no label was found in the classical endosomal network . In some instances , intriguing tubular networks were seen with labeling for anti \u2013 CD44 - HRP after 40 min of internal - ization ( Fig . 5 E , arrowheads ) , possibly representing a mature compartment arisen from the CLIC pathway . The presence of anti - CD44 antibodies had no effect on the number or morphol - ogy of CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden CLICs between 2 and 40 min ( not de - picted ) , indicating that the CD44 antibodies do not influence the kinetics or ultrastructure of the pathway . Using CD44 as a novel and specific marker for CLICs , it was also possible to confirm stereology calculations using CTxB - HRP in the presence of dynamin inhibition . Anti - CD44 - HRP \u2013 conjugated antibodies or Tf - HRP was internalized in Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs and the DAB reaction was performed ( Fig . 5 , F and G ) . This method has the advantage of relying on the specificity of CD44 for the CLIC pathway and Tf - HRP for CME . We found that CD44 - positive CLICs accounted for 0 . 09 \u00b1 0 . 02 % of the total cytoplasmic volume after 15 s , 0 . 14 \u00b1 0 . 03 % after 1 min , and 0 . 34 \u00b1 0 . 01 % after 2 min ( Fig . 5 G ) . These volume estimates are in excellent agreement with those obtained using morphological criteria or using specific inhibitors of dynamin - dependent endo - cytosis ( see above ) . These data identify a range of novel CLIC cargo , confirm the significant magnitude of the pathway , and pro - vide evidence for the direct recruitment of dynamin and Rab11 to CLICs and the ability to sort cargo to distinct destinations . Polarization of CLICs during cellular migration Based on the association of novel CLIC cargo , such as Thy - 1 and CD44 with extracellular attachment , we sought to visualize CLICs within migrating cells . As regulation of adhesion compo - nents is a fundamental process during cellular migration the CLIC pathway may be either up - regulated or spatially restricted within motile cells . A scratch - wound was applied to a confluent monolayer of fibroblasts and cells were allowed to migrate into the space provided by the wound . Early endocytosis of CTxB and Tf was assessed in the presence of either internalizing anti - CD44 or anti \u2013 Thy - 1 antibodies or was followed by labeling for endogenous Cav1 ( Fig . 6 A ) . Colocalization was seen between CTxB - 555 and both CD44 and Thy - 1 at the leading edge of mi - grating cells ( arrows ) . In cells expressing GFP - GPI , anti - GFP antibody endocytosis also preferentially occurred at the leading edge ( Fig . 6 A ) , indicating polarization of CLICs rather than po - larized uptake of specific GPI - APs involved in migration , such as Thy - 1 . There was a clear spatial distinction between CTxB - 555 , Cav1 , and Tf - 647 in these cells , which was confirmed by assessing average pixel intensity across a selected field ( Fig . 6 B ) . It has been well documented that Cav1 localizes to the trailing edge during 2D migration ( Grande - Garc\u00eda et al . , 2007 ) . We also found that CTxB binding after fixation was uniform over the en - tire cell , excluding the possibility that GM1 was polarized within these cells ( not depicted ) .

Clearly , however , dynamin is not required for the generation of CLIC architecture , as the morphology of CLICs is identical in the presence or absence of dynamin inhibition . Recruitment of dynamin to CLICs as they mature would reconcile the direct interaction between GRAF1 and dynamin within this dynamin - independent pathway ( Hansen and Nichols , 2009 ) . Myoferlin , a novel CLIC - associated target identified here , is a member of the ferlin family of proteins implicated in mem - brane fusion ( Davis et al . , 2000 ) . We have previously shown that another ferlin family member , dysferlin , associates with the CLIC pathway ( Hern\u00e1ndez - Deviez et al . , 2008 ) . Myoferlin , like dysferlin , is involved in calcium - dependent membrane fusion after mechanical disruption to the PM ( Bernatchez et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , a clathrin - independent , GPI - enriched endocytic com - partment has been implicated in membrane repair after PM shearing ( Idone et al . , 2008a , b ) . This raises the exciting possibil - ity of links between the role of dysferlin / myoferlin in this pro - cess and the ability of CLICs to provide the necessary membrane for repair of PM lesions . Supporting this , two targets identified here , AHNAK and Annexin A2 , have been shown to bind dysfer - lin and myoferlin during membrane repair ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) . Localization of dysferlin / myoferlin to a subdomain of CLICs that does not merge with Tf - positive EEs highlights that this pathway has the capability to rapidly recycle membrane back to the PM under specific conditions , such as PM repair ( Fig . 7 B ) . Evidence for an association between CLICs and cellular migration is provided by the distinct polarization of CLICs in motile cells , as well as the impairment of migration after tran - sient ablation of the pathway . Specific internalization of Thy - 1 and CD44 through the CLIC pathway at the leading edge pro - vides an explicit role for CLICs in rapid turnover of adhesion receptors within a spatially restricted mechanism . How CLICs become polarized during migration remains an open question ; however , one possibility arises from activity of the initial regula - tor of the CLIC / GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . Cdc42 was originally described as directing cell polarity during yeast budding ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) and plays an assortment of fundamental roles during eukaryotic cell polarization ( Etienne - Manneville , 2004 ) . After wounding of cell monolayers Cdc42 activity is specifically directed to the front of the cell , resultant from signaling between contacts and the ECM ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ) . As Cdc42 activity is necessary for formation of CLICs , this would lead to specific localization of CLICs at the leading edge of wounded monolayers . The clathrin adaptor , Numb , is also Discussion Here we identify the CLIC pathway as a high capacity route that accounts for the vast bulk of constitutive fluid uptake in fibro - blasts , implicating CLICs as key mediators of PM remodeling . Previous estimations of endosomal tubule volume using stereol - ogy have noted that tubules close to section thickness ( 55 nm ) can lead to overprojection effects ( Griffiths et al . , 1989 ) . When correction factors are applied to volume estimates CLICs would still account for over 70 % of internalization . Bulk phase early endocytosis in rat fetal fibroblasts has also been shown to be in - dependent from clathrin and occurs via a constitutive , noncave - olar pathway , which rapidly regurgitates substantial amounts of endocytic volume ( Cupers et al . , 1994 ) . We have previously shown that up to 40 % of endocytosed fluid , mainly internalized through the CLIC / GEEC pathway , is regurgitated in 5 min ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Together , this suggests that the CLIC pathway in - ternalizes and returns significant portions of the PM quickly , rapidly turning over membrane during key cellular processes , such as PM repair and homeostasis . It also provides the endo - cytic system with a mechanism to remodel features of the PM quickly , critical for extracellular interactions during various processes ranging from adhesion to signaling . Such vast mem - brane flow and recycling has recently been observed from a GPI - AP \u2013 positive CIE compartment , which provides a signfi - cant fraction of the required membrane during cellular spread - ing ( Gauthier et al . , 2009 ) . Calculation of fluid uptake via clathrin - independent endo - cytosis has generally estimated the contribution of these routes to be 40 \u2013 60 % of total fluid internalization ( Sandvig et al . , 1987 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . The higher contri - bution of 74 % , calculated here , may be explained through differ - ences in the resolution , both spatial and temporal , of experimental procedures used . By calculating volume internalized based on ultrastructure rather than fluorescence this work provides a higher resolution analysis than previous studies , which were limited by the optical resolution of fluorescence microscopy . The 3D structure of CLICs identifies them as pleiomorphic , complex , multicomponent carriers . Although it is recognized that the bulk of CLIC - internalized fluid and membrane fuses with EEs , discrepancies between the ability of CLIC cargos , such as dysferlin / myoferlin and CD44 compared with GFP - GPI and CTxB , to fuse with Tf - positive endosomes strengthens the argument that some domain of CLICs traffics distinctly from the bulk ( Fig . 7 A ) . Recruitment of dynamin to CLICs , after budding from the PM , further demonstrates the sorting complexity of the route .

Materials and methods Internalization assay Cells on 12 - mm coverslips or 35 - mm dishes were serum starved for 4 h in serum - free DME ( Invitrogen ) before two times 2 - min wash in precooled CO 2 - independent media ( Invitrogen ) on ice and placed on 50 - \u00b5l drops of 10 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 CTxB - 555 ( Invitrogen ) , 5 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 Tf - 488 ( Invitrogen ) , and / or anti - GFP as desired for 20 min . For stereology , 35 - mm dishes were not in - cubated on ice but were subjected to constitutive uptake at 37\u00b0C , 5 % CO 2 for desired times . Coverslips were moved to prewarmed serum - free DME and incubated at 37\u00b0C , 5 % CO 2 for desired times . Coverslips were placed back on ice in precooled CO 2 - independent media . Two times 30 - s 0 . 5 M glycine ( pH 2 . 2 ) acid stripping was routinely performed before fixation in 2 % paraformaldehyde . For immunocytochemistry , cells were permeabi - lized in freshly made 0 . 1 % saponin for 10 min and blocked in 0 . 2 % fish skin gelatin / 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS . Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature , followed by three times 10 - min wash in PBS before incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor \u2013 conjugated antibodies at 1 : 400 for 1 h . Fluorescence micrographs were captured on a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Axiovert 200 m SP LSM 510 META ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . Images were captured under oil with a 63x Plan - Apochromat objective , at excitation wavelengths of 488 , 543 , and 633 nm for GFP - tagged con - structs or Alexa Fluor 488 \u2013 , Alexa Fluor 555 \u2013 , or Alexa Fluor 647 / 660 \u2013 conjugated antibodies , respectively . Band - pass and meta filters were applied as appropriate for respective fluorophores and images were cap - tured from photomultiplier tube detectors ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . Colocalization was quantitated using Volocity v3 . 7 . Images of individual cells were split into RGB channels , automatic thresholding applied , and colocalization co - efficients calculated on percentage of overlapping voxels . Antibodies used include Thy - 1 and CD44 ( Abcam ) ; CHC , GM130 , Grp78 , Cav1 , and HA ( BD ) ; myc ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ; and TfR ( Invitrogen ) . HRP - conjugated anti - CD44 was generated with Lightning - Link HRP conjugation kit ( Innova Bioscience ) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Dynamin and PI3K inhibition Cells were serum starved for 4 h in serum - free DME before incubation for 20 min with 30 \u00b5M Dyngo4a , 80 \u00b5M dynasore ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , or 100 nM wortmannin ( Roche ) . Cells were then incubated with an endocytic marker of interest in the presence of Dyngo4a and wortmannin for indi - cated periods at 37\u00b0C . Electron microscopy and DAB reaction After constitutive internalization of 10 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 CTxB - HRP ( Invitrogen ) at 37\u00b0C , cells were placed on ice and washed two times for 1 min in ice cold PBS , followed by 10 min in 1 mg . ml 2 1 DAB ( Sigma - Aldrich ) \u00b1 50 \u00b5M ascor - bic acid ( AA ) in PBS . Cells were then incubated with DAB \u00b1 50 \u00b5M AA with 0 . 012 % H 2 O 2 for 20 min , followed by fixation in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( ProSciTech ) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature . For plastic sections , cells were contrasted with 1 % osmium tetroxide and 4 % uranyl acetate . Cells were dehydrated in successive washes of 70 % , 90 % and 100 % ethanol before embedding in LX - 112 resin . For frozen sections , cells were scraped and embedded in 10 % gelatin and gelatin blocks were infused with 2 . 3 M sucrose . Blocks were frozen onto mounting pins and 55 - nm sections were collected using a UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica ) . Tomograms of 300 - nm plastic sections were captured in 1\u00b0 increments , tilted \u00b160\u00b0 on a transmission elec - tron microscope ( model F30 ; Tecnai ) using UltraScan 4000 semi - automated software . High pressure frozen samples were essentially processed as de - scribed previously ( Richter et al . , 2008 ) . In brief , CTxB - HRP was added di - rectly to cells grown on sapphire discs and DAB reaction was performed on ice before discs were frozen in a Balzers HPM010 high pressure freezer ( BAL - TEC AG ) and stored under liquid nitrogen . Freeze substitution was performed in acetone with 0 . 7 % uranyl acetate ; 1 % osmium tetroxide at 2 90\u00b0C before warming to 0\u00b0C over 3 d and infiltrated with Embed 812 - Araldite resin . specifically localized to the leading edge where it mediates integrin - \ue062 1 endocytosis ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) . It appears surprising that Numb - positive CCVs and CLICs both polarize to the leading edge during migration . One possible explanation for this is the types of cargo internalizing through each pathway . Adhesion components without a CCP sorting motif , such as CD44 and Thy - 1 , still need to be internalized for efficient migra - tion and this could occur via CLICs at the leading edge . Con - sistent with such a hypothesis , a screen for genes involved in epithelial cell migration identified that knock - down of GRAF1 , a regulator of the CLIC pathway ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , reduced the capacity of these cells to migrate ( Simpson et al . , 2008 ) . This study has shown the significant magnitude of traf - fic through this largely uncharacterized sorting compartment . Rather than acting as passive carriers that shuttle from the PM to EEs , we propose that CLICs arise from the plasma membrane Figure 7 . Model of CLIC endocytosis . ( A ) ( 1 ) CLIC cargo , such as Thy - 1 , CD44 , and myoferlin are concentrated within Flotillin - 1 and cholesterol - enriched microdomains . ( 2 ) Actin and GRAF - 1 drive the initial formation of the carriers , within 15 s . ( 3 ) Recruitment of dynamin , Rab11 , and Rab5 / EEA - 1 complexes within 2 min provides the ability for these carriers to facilitate bulk membrane flow to early endosomes ( 4a ) and fast plasma membrane recycling ( 4b ) . ( B ) After abrasion to the PM an influx of Ca 2 + activates the fusogenic C2 domains of dysferlin / myoferlin , resulting in the preferential recycling of the CLIC pathway .

S ( v ) of plasma membrane across 25 cells , from low magnification electron micrographs , multiplied by the total average volume . To capture the average volume of single CTxB - HRP \u2013 positive CLIC , high resolution electron micrographs from whole - mount profiles were used . As CTxB - HRP label ( as well as HRP and anti - CD44 - HRP label ) was only found within the tubular ring of CLICs , we assumed that the entire volume of CLICs is comprised solely within the tubule space . Therefore , the volume of a sphere based on the diameter of the inner membrane was subtracted from the volume of a sphere based on the diameter of the outer membrane of the rings . This calculated that an average CLIC had an estimated volume of 0 . 00263 \u00b1 0 . 00048 \u00b5m 3 . In comparison , the volume of a single CCV was estimated to be five times smaller ( 0 . 0005 \u00b5m 3 assuming sphere based on diameter of 100 nm ) . Mass spectrometry An Agilent 1100 Binary HPLC system ( Agilent Technologies ) was used to per - form reversed phase separation of the in - gel digests using a Vydac MS C18 300A column ( 150 mm \u00d7 2 mm ) with a particle size of 5 \u00b5m ( Vydac ) . Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a hybrid quadrupole / linear ion trap 4000 QTRAP MS / MS system ( Applied Biosystems ) . All analyses were performed using information - dependent acquisition and the linear ion trap ( LIT ) acquisition modes . Analyst 1 . 4 . 1 software was used for data analysis . Cell migration Confluent WT MEFs grown on coverslips were scratched with a 200 - \u00b5l pipette tip . Cells were washed and allowed to recover for 4 h before inter - nalization assays . Average pixel intensity from leading to trailing edges within a selected area was calculated using the Plot Profile option in ImageJ . Plot profiles show a representative image of 5 \u2013 10 cells across three independent experiments . DAB ablation 10 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 CTxB - HRP was added to cell monolayers for 2 min at 37\u00b0C . Cells were then incubated with 10 mg . ml 2 1 DAB , 50 \u00b5M AA in DME for 2 min before incubation with 10 mg . ml 2 1 DAB , 50 \u00b5M AA , 0 . 012 % H 2 O 2 in DME for a further 2 min . Cells were washed five times with DME before incubation in normal growth media for 4 h . CTxB - 555 , Tf - 647 , and anti - CD44 antibodies were then directly added to cells for 2 min before acid stripping , fixation , permeabilization , and labeling for anti - CD44 antibodies . For quantitation of distance migrated , monolayers were imaged after DAB inactivation ( time zero ) and again after 4 h . Distance between front edges of monolayers on both sides of the wound was measured using Adobe Photoshop CS2 . Anti - CD44 - HRP and Tf - HRP failed to inhibit either clathrin - independent or - dependent endocytosis at concentrations of 10 \u2013 100 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 as used at early times in this assay . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows that wortmannin treatment of MEFs inhibits the fusion of CLICs with early endosomes , leading to a threefold increase in the number of CLICs per cell . Wortmannin treatment does not noticeably affect the pro - tein profiles of the CLIC - enriched fraction . Fig . S2 shows the consistent na - ture of membrane profiles in the CLIC - enriched fraction and that CTxB - HRP labels a majority of these profiles when added to cells before the fraction - ation . Fig . S3 shows the localization of dynamin to CLICs after wortmannin treatment by immunofluorescence and by ultrastructure . Dynamin also labels the neck of profiles in the CLIC - enriched fraction . Video 1 shows the tilt series of CTxB - HRP \u2013 laden CLICs after 15 s of internalization .

Submitted : 22 February 2010 Accepted : 26 July 2010 Nycodenz density fractionation NIH3T3 \u2013 GFP - GPI cells were serum starved and treated for 20 min with 100 nM wortmannin and 30 \u00b5M Dyngo4a . Anti - GFP antibodies were di - rectly added to treated cells in the presence of wortmannin and Dyngo4a for 5 min at 37\u00b0C . Cells were placed on ice and harvested by scraping in TES buffer ( 10 mM tricine , 1 mM EDTA , and 250 mM sucrose , pH 7 . 4 ) with dissolved complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Cells were ho - mogenized by passaging 10 times each through 21 - and 27 - gauge nee - dles . A 17 , 000 - g spin at 4\u00b0C for 10 min was applied to sediment nonlysed cells and nuclei . Post - nuclear supernatants were mixed with an equal vol - ume 70 % Nycodenz in TES and placed on the bottom of a four - step gradi - ent , consisting of 25 % , 10 % , and 0 % Nycodenz steps . Gradients were spun at 160 , 000 g for 2 h . The 10 % fraction ( excluding the interface ) was collected and diluted 1 / 3 in TES with protease inhibitors and placed on top of a 5 \u2013 20 % continuous Nycodenz gradient . This was spun at 206 , 000 g for 2 h . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and TCA - precipitable samples analyzed by SDS - PAGE and LC / MS - MS . For visual - ization of Nycodenz fraction morphology by EM , 10 \u00b5l of fraction of interest was mixed with 10 \u00b5l 5 % glutaraldehyde and a 100 mesh copper EM grid was placed on top for 30 min at room temperature . Grids were washed three times 5 min with PBS , followed by five times 2 min H 2 O before staining with 1 : 9 ( by volume ) of 4 % uranyl acetate to 2 % methyl cellulose for 10 min on ice . CTxB biotinylation CTxB - 555 was biotinylated with 2 mg . ml 2 1 EZ - link Sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and biotin quenched with 1 : 1 volume of 200 mM glycine for 5 min . CTxB - biotin was added to Cav1 2 / 2 MEFs either treated with 30 \u00b5M Dyngo4a or left untreated for the times indi - cated . After CTxB - biotin internalization , cells were placed on ice and stripped with three times 5 - min washes with 100 mM MesNa ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . MesNa was quenched with three times 5 - min washes with 54 mM iodo - acetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were harvested in TNE ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 5 mM EDTA ) with complete protease inhibitors ( Roche ) and solubilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 . BCA protein assays ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were routinely performed to accommodate equivalent loading . Western blots were probed with streptavidin - HRP ( Invitrogen ) in 5 % skim milk , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Intensity of developed HRP chemiluminescent bands was determined for multiple exposures per sample in ImageJ using Gel Analyzer . Stereology Serum - starved cells were incubated directly with 10 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 CTxB - HRP , 20 mg . ml 2 1 HRP ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 anti - CD44 - HRP antibodies or 20 \u00b5g . ml 2 1 Tf - HRP ( Invitrogen ) for desired times before being placed on ice , washed with precooled CO 2 - independent media , and processed for the DAB reaction and EPON embedding . Vertical sections , visualized at 20 , 000x on a transmission electron microscope ( model 1011 ; JEOL ) , were overlayed with a 2 , 000 - nm square lattice grid using iTEM software . The number of intersections that fell on top of the cytoplasm , excluding the nu - cleus , were recorded across 20 \u2013 25 cells and three independent areas . A 200 - nm square lattice grid was also applied and intersections that fell on top of DAB - labeled structures were recorded as above . Number of points lying over DAB - labeled structures multiplied by the grid size was com - pared , as a percentage , to points over cytoplasm by grid size to give the percentage of labeled structures to cytoplasmic volume ( V ( v ) ) . Overprojec - tion effects on endosomal tubules can lead to volume overestimation as de - scribed previously ( Griffiths et al . , 1989 ) . Based on the section thickness , average diameter , and length of CLICs , a correction factor of 0 . 65 can be applied to the V ( v ) measurements , based on graphs previously developed ( Weibel , 1979 ) . Correction factors are approximate only and give an esti - mate of possible error . Based on tomography data ( Fig . 3 ) , however , CLICs display a depth greater than section thickness ( entire volume is still within 300 - nm section , far thicker than 55 - nm sections used for volume calcula - tion ) , in which case overprojection effects become negligible . Surface density , or surface volume fraction ( S ( v ) ) , was calculated by placing a cycloid grid over high resolution images of CTxB - HRP \u2013 labeled structures and using the formula : S ( v ) = 2I / P\u2022l ( p ) , where I = total intersec - tions of cycloid grid with structure of interest , P = total points of cycloid grid lying over structure of interest , and l ( p ) = length of the cyloid in \u00b5m , which was an absolute distance of 75 nm in this study . Total cellular volume of a Cav1 2 / 2 MEF was calculated by binding CTxB - 555 to fixed cells . Confocal Z - stacks were obtained from five repre - sentative cells and total average cellular volume was calculated using Volocity v3 . 7 . Surface area of Cav1 2 / 2 MEF was calculated by finding the D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / r up r e ss . o r g / j c b / a r t i c l e - pd f / 190 / 4 / 675 / 1348109 / j c b _ 201002119 . pd f b y U n i v e r s i t y O f W a s h i ng t on u s e r on 30 J une 2023 JCB \u2022 VOLUME 190 \u2022 NUMBER 4 \u2022 2010 690 cytoplasm with dysferlin during skeletal muscle regeneration .

Assembly of actin branch junctions requires the Arp2 / 3 complex , upon activation , to initiate a new actin ( daughter ) filament branch from the side of an existing ( mother ) filament , leading to the formation of a dendritic actin network with the fast growing ( barbed ) ends facing the direction of movement . Using genetic labeling and electron microscopy , we have determined the structural organization of actin branch junctions assembled in vitro with 1 - nm precision . We show here that the activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , except cortactin , dissociate after branch formation . The Arp2 / 3 complex associates with the mother filament through a comprehensive network of interactions , with the long axis of the complex aligned nearly perpendicular to the mother filament . The actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , are positioned with their barbed ends facing the direction of daughter filament growth . This subunit map brings direct structural insights into the mechanism of assembly and mechanical stability of actin branch junctions .

( 2005 ) Mechanism of filament nucleation and branch stability revealed by the structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex at actin branch junctions . PLoS Biol 3 ( 11 ) : e383 . Introduction The Arp2 / 3 complex is a key cytoskeletal regulator of actin polymerization [ 1 ] . The complex promotes the assembly of dendritic actin networks that drive cell locomotion , phag - ocytosis , and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles , organelles , and invasive pathogens [ 2 ] . Conserved among eukaryotes , this seven - subunit , 220 - kDa complex consists of two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , and \ufb01ve additional subunits named ARPC1 through ARPC5 . The isolated complex has a low nucleation activity , but upon binding to nucleation promot - ing factors ( NPFs ) , ATP , and preexisting ( mother ) actin \ufb01laments , the Arp2 / 3 complex promotes the formation of a branched actin structure where the complex itself is situated at the branch junction [ 3 , 4 ] . Despite intensive study , the mechanistic details of the branch junction formation are still poorly understood , partly because of the lack of high - resolution information about the structure of the activated conformation of the complex at the branch junction . Two speculative models have been proposed for subunit organization of the Arp2 / 3 complex at these branch junctions . Information used for the modeling included sequence conservation among species , available biochemical and structural information , and , most important , the hypoth - esis that Arp2 and Arp3 assume an actin \ufb01lament dimer - like con\ufb01guration that templates the initiation of the daughter \ufb01lament in the barbed end direction [ 5 , 6 ] . Another concep - tually different model , derived primarily from kinetic analysis , suggested that the Arp2 / 3 complex induces branching and elongation at the barbed end of growing \ufb01laments with Arp2 and Arp3 being incorporated in two different actin \ufb01laments [ 7 ] . However , no direct structural data were available to support any of the proposed nucleation models . We provide here the \ufb01rst structural analysis to our knowl - edge of the Arp2 / 3 subunit organization at the branch junction at molecular resolution using genetic labeling , electron microscopy , and computational analysis . We show that various NPFs , except cortactin , dissociate from the complex after branch formation and that all of the Arp2 / 3 subunits are in a position to contact the mother \ufb01lament . In contrast to the previous attempts to model the orientation of Arp2 / 3 within the actin branch , we have not assumed that Arp2 and Arp3 are orientated toward the daughter \ufb01lament . Thus , our unbiased subunit localization provides direct evidence that Arp2 and Arp3 are positioned with their barbed ends facing the direction of daughter \ufb01lament growth . Results / Discussion A direct observation of the complex within the branch junction at molecular resolution is required to better under - stand the mechanism of branched actin nucleation by the Received June 23 , 2005 ; Accepted September 12 , 2005 ; Published November 8 , 2005 DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 0030383 Copyright : (cid:1) 2005 Egile et al .

The general strategy that we have taken to achieve this goal was to assemble actin branches in vitro using a complex with one of the subunits carrying a label that can be detected by electron microscopy . The location of the label ( and the corresponding subunit ) in the image plane can be determined by difference mapping between the two - dimen - sional ( 2D ) projection maps of branches assembled with labeled and unlabeled complexes . The WASp - Family NPFs , but Not Cortactin , Detach from the Arp2 / 3 Complex after Branch Formation We \ufb01rst employed this strategy to compare branch junctions formed in the presence of different NPFs of increasing molecular weight . Difference mapping would allow detection of the additional density contributed by the larger NPF , allowing localization of the NPF in the branch junction . We assembled actin branches with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex or Acanthamoeba complex in the presence of WASp - family NPFs of various sizes that contained the Arp2 / 3 - activating region WA ( WASp homology 2 and acidic motifs ) ( Figure S1 ) . These were N - WASp WA ( ; 12 kDa ) , glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) \u2013 N - WASp WA ( ; 40 kDa ) , WAVE1 / Scar WA ( ; 12 kDa ) , maltose binding protein ( MBP ) \u2013 tagged WAVE1 / Scar WA ( ; 55 kDa ) , full - length N - WASp ( GST - N - WASp bound to its activator GST - Nck and forming a complex of ; 153 kDa ) , and a non - WASp activator , cortactin . Projection images of the branches were boxed , aligned , and averaged to yield two - dimensional ( 2D ) projection maps of the branch junction structure with a resolution of approx - imately 2 . 2 nm ( Figure 1 ) . The resolution was estimated based on the Fourier ring correlation criteria with a cut - off value of 0 . 5 . Interestingly , no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences ( at 99 . 5 % con\ufb01dence level , p \u00bc 0 . 005 ) were observed between the density maps of branches assembled with various WA proteins ( 12 to 153 kDa ) ( Figure 1A - 1F ) , whereas a clearly visible , statistically signi\ufb01cant difference was observed with GST - cortactin ( 90 kDa ) ( Figure 1G - 1I ) . The ability to detect the activator was veri\ufb01ed by difference maps using free activated complexes selected from the same electron micro - scope grids from which the branches were selected ( X . - P . X . , D . H . , and N . V . , unpublished data ) . The additional density attributed to cortactin was located on the obtuse side of the branch next to the main bridge of density on the daughter \ufb01lament side ( Figure 1I ) . Cortactin enhances the persistence of lamellipodia protrusion during cell motility [ 8 ] and probably promotes this effect by stabilizing Arp2 / 3 branches induced by WAVE2 / Scar2 [ 9 ] . Thus , the localization of cortactin at the branch junction provides a mechanism for stabilizing either the Arp - mother or the Arp - daughter interaction . We favor a stabilization of the Arp - mother interaction , as this would explain the nucleation promoting effect of cortactin on the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , the relatively weak signal observed with GST - cortactin construct precludes determination of the molecular nature of cortactin interactions with the mother or the daughter \ufb01lament . Our localization positioned the construct density at a site consistent with the idea that cortactin might bind to the Arp3 subunit . The absence of WASp - family NPFs at the branch junction , as revealed by the difference maps , is consistent with the observation that N - WASp / WASp - coated beads undergo motility by cycles of binding , activation , and release of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 , 11 ] . Localization of Arp2 , Arp3 , Arc40 / ARPC1 , and Arc18 / ARPC3 Subunits at Actin Branch Junction To locate Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in the branch junction by difference mapping , we took a genetic approach to introduce a label to individual subunits of the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex . Yeast genes encoding Arp2 , Arp3 , Arc40 / ARPC1 , and Arc18 / ARPC3 subunits were tagged with green \ufb02uores - cent protein ( GFP ) or yellow \ufb02uorescent protein ( YFP ) coding sequence at their genomic loci through homologous recom - bination . The C - terminus of each labeled subunit was separated from the label by an eight - amino - acid linker . The advantages of this strategy over the more traditional gold - labeling methods are that our strategy allows highly ef\ufb01cient labeling ( ; 100 % ) of each subunit and convenient assessment of the functionality of the labeled complex . All four GFP / YFP - tagged strains grew normally at room temperature ( not shown ) and 30 8 C compared to the unlabeled ( control ) strain ( Figure 2A ) . The GFP label also contained a ( His ) 10 tag at the C - terminus , allowing puri\ufb01cation of the labeled complex by Ni - NTA af\ufb01nity ( Figure 2B ) . The unlabeled control Arp2 / 3 complex was also isolated by Ni - NTA af\ufb01nity . The nucleation activities of these complexes were tested using the pyrene - actin polymerization assay in the presence of GST - N - WASp WA . The labeled complexes exhibited the same level of nucleation activity as the unlabeled complex ( Figure 2C ) . Figure 1 .

Projection maps of the branch junction structures at a resolution of approximately 2 . 2 nm were generated ( Figure 3 ) . Difference maps between branches obtained with the labeled complexes and the unlabeled complex were calcu - lated ( Figure 3B and 3C ) . For cross - validation , each dataset was analyzed independently by two different operators using two different image analysis protocols ( Figure S2 ) . All difference maps contain peaks in the branch junction that are statistically signi\ufb01cant at a con\ufb01dence level of 99 . 5 % ( p \u00bc 0 . 005 ) using Student\u2019s t - test . The sizes of the peaks are consistent with the presence of an additional protein of the size of a GFP or YFP monomer ( ; 30 kDa ) . In the 2D projection of actin branch junctions , the Arp2 / 3 complex forms three bridges of density between the mother and daughter \ufb01lament : a strong bridge of density on the side of the acute angle , a weak bridge of density on the side of the obtuse angle , and a medium bridge of density in the middle ( see Figure 1A ) [ 3 ] . The difference maps between the projection densities obtained from the labeled complexes and the control complex showed that the YFP attached to Arc40 / ARPC1 was present on the main bridge close to the mother \ufb01lament , the GFP attached to Arp3 was on the same side but further away from the mother \ufb01lament , and the GFP attached to Arc18 / ARPC3 was located on the weak bridge close to the mother \ufb01lament . The GFP attached to Arp2 generated two statistically signi\ufb01cant peaks in the difference maps of Arp2 - GFP : one located on the obtuse angle of the branch , and the other on the acute side . The two peaks correspond to two alternative stable positions of the GFP , because the population of the Arp2 - GFP branches can be sorted into two clusters that each show only one peak ( Figure S3 ) . Both GFP positions are compatible with the same C - terminus location owing to the length of the \ufb02exible linker ( Figure 3F ) . Determination of the Orientation of the Arp2 / 3 Complex at the Branch Junction by Computational Modeling For all difference maps , the peaks correspond to a projection onto the image plane ( XY ) of the respective center - of - mass position of the label . Despite the lack of information on the out - of - plane ( Z ) coordinates , we can use the XY coordinates of the centers of mass as ef\ufb01cient constraints for the three - dimensional ( 3D ) orientation of the complex , because the XY projection of the C - terminus of each labeled subunit must fall within a distance de\ufb01ned by the length of the covalently attached linker and the topology of the label ( Figure 3E - 3G ) . In the branch junction , all of the individual positions must be satis\ufb01ed simultaneously . For example , the C - terminus of Arp2 needs to be in a position that allows attachment to GFP at both positions detected in the difference maps . This restricts the possible XY projection of the Arp2 C - terminus to the small area where the distance to both peaks is below the cut - off distance ( i . e . , the common area of the two circles in Figure 3F ) . Addition of constraints for the other subunits further reduces the number of compatible orientations . A global orientation search with the crystal structure of the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 ] was carried out to map all orientations that are compatible with the given constraints . The results revealed only a single cluster of orientations that satis\ufb01ed the label constraints ( Figure 4 ) with an estimated precision of approximately 1 nm . In all permissible orientations , domains I and III of both Arp2 and Arp3 , corresponding to the fast growing ( barbed ) end in an actin \ufb01lament , are facing away from the mother \ufb01lament toward the daughter \ufb01lament . The relative orientations of Arp2 and Arp3 would need to change from that in the inactive structure in order to provide a suitable template for the growth of the daughter \ufb01lament . The exact nature of these changes are unknown , but the amplitudes of the changes detected so far [ 13 ] are small enough to argue against massive subunit rearrangements such Figure 2 . Characterization of GFP - or YFP - Labeled Yeast Arp2 / 3 Complexes ( A ) Serial dilutions of yeast strain cultures expressing Arp3 - GFP , Arp2 - GFP , Arc40 - YFP , and Arc18 - GFP Arp2 / 3 - labeled complexes , as well as the unlabeled control complex , were grown on YPD plates at 30 8 C . ( B ) Purified yeast Arp2 / 3 complexes visualized by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining ; unlabeled ( control ) , and GFP - or YFP - labeled Arp3 , Arp2 , Arc40 , or Arc18 complexes . The labeled subunits are marked by arrowheads . The Arc40 subunit in the labeled Arc40 / ARPC1 - YFP complex ran as 30 - kDa and high - molecular - weight species ( previously confirmed by immunoblotting and peptide sequencing ) , owing to an unusual electrophoretic mobility [ 16 ] .

The preservation of overall topology of the complex is supported by the fact that all of the constraints obtained in this study for the positions of the labels can be satis\ufb01ed without the need to introduce changes in the relative orientation of the subunits in the inactive complex . Consistent with a conformational change upon activation , the relative orientation of both Arp2 and Arp3 would need to be altered in our model to provide an exact match of the daughter \ufb01lament with the direction of its projection density . This conformation could be achieved by an approximately 15 8 rotation of Arp3 around its short axis and an approximately 15 8 rotation of Arp2 around an axis parallel to its short axis passing through domain I of Arp3 , accompanied by a slight adjustment of the overall complex orientation ( , 5 8 ) . Even though this rearrangement corre - sponds to a substantial conformational change in the Arp2 / 3 complex , these rotations would be fully compatible with the constraints imposed by the labels , leading to displacements of the labeled C - termini projections by less than the estimated precision ( , 1 nm ) . The resulting daughter \ufb01lament would not only grow parallel to the XY plane and coincide with the direction of the daughter \ufb01lament in the projection maps but also \ufb01t the shape of the projection density remarkably well ( Figure 4E and 4F ) . Domains II and IV of Arp3 ( orange in Figure 4 ) are well positioned to make direct contact with the mother \ufb01lament . The other Arp2 / 3 subunits are also in a position to contact the mother \ufb01lament , with Arp2 ( pink ) being the furthest away from the mother \ufb01lament ( Figure 4A - 4D ) . The fact that Arp3 is close to the mother \ufb01lament was not apparent from the projection images alone [ 3 ] and could not be inferred from other available data . The data from subunit labeling , in conjunction with the crystal structure of the isolated complex , allowed a much more detailed and accurate assignment of the densities than previously possible and indicate that the previous assignment was one unit off ( i . e . , the previous Arp3 position corresponds to Arp2 and Arp2 to the \ufb01rst actin monomer in the daughter \ufb01lament ) . Conclusions The data presented here support the model that Arp2 and Arp3 adopt an actin short - pitch dimer - like con\ufb01guration that templates the initiation of the daughter \ufb01lament in the barbed end direction . The data are incompatible with the proposed incorporation of Arp2 and Arp3 into two different actin \ufb01laments at the branch junction [ 7 ] . The two available hypothetical structural models of the branch junction [ 5 , 6 ] ( illustrated in Figure 4G and 4H ) relied on the assumption that the barbed ends of Arp2 and Arp3 face the daughter \ufb01lament to orient the complex within the branch junction . In contrast , the labeling - based model presented here did not use this assumption as a constraint , and therefore our results lend unbiased evidence to the proposed mechanism where Arp2 and Arp3 serve as a template dimer for the barbed - end - directed growth of the daughter \ufb01lament . Additionally , our localization data are incompatible with the positions of the C - termini of the subunits proposed in both these previous models ( compare Figure 4A with 4G and 4H ) . These models suggested that the longest axis of the complex , comprising ARPC1 , (cid:1) 5 , (cid:1) 4 , and (cid:1) 2 ( Arc40 , (cid:1) 15 , (cid:1) 19 , and (cid:1) 35 in the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ) , contacts the side of the mother \ufb01lament ( Figure 4G and 4H ) . Our model deviates from these models by an anticlockwise rotation of approximately 100 8 around the axis of the daughter \ufb01lament , resulting in an alignment of the longest axis almost perpendicular rather than parallel to the mother \ufb01lament ( Figure 4A ) . This geometry could allow comprehensive interactions between the axis formed by ARPC2 / 4 ( with possible contribution from ARPC5 ) and a groove of the mother \ufb01lament , with Arp3 and ARPC3 on one side and ARPC1 on the other side to provide stabilizing interactions that would prevent the complex from rocking horizontally as well as vertically against the mother \ufb01lament . In summary , our model provides the structural basis for the mechanical stability of branch junction that is important for effective force generation upon \ufb01lament elongation at the barbed ends . It is fully consistent with the available biochemical data and the growth direction of the daughter \ufb01lament and directly supports the template - dimer model of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation . The subunit map estab - lished in this analysis thus provides a new structural frame - work for further understanding the spatial and temporal control of branch nucleation and turnover in the generation Figure 3 .

The GFP / YFP label was attached to the C - terminus of the relevant subunit with an eight - amino - acid flexible linker that in fully extended conformation can reach a length of up to approximately 3 . 2 nm . The distance of the N - terminus of GFP or YFP from the center of mass of its beta - barrel ( 14 3 8 3 8 nm ) is approximately 2 . 5 nm . The centers of the peaks determined from the difference maps probably coincide with the center of mass . Bar \u00bc 10 nm .

Materials and Methods Plasmids , genetic manipulations , and yeast strains . Yeast strains expressing C - terminal GFP - or YFP - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex subunits were generated by homologous recombination by the integration of a cassette containing a linker ( GDGAGLIN ) , the yEGFP ( or yECitrine ) coding sequence , and a polyhistidine ( His ) 10 tag at the 3 9 end of each open reading frame . The cassette was generated using pCE36 , a derivative of pKT128 [ 14 ] . Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Proteins . Actin was puri\ufb01ed from rabbit muscle and isolated as Ca 2 \u00fe - ATP - G - actin in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 7 . 8 ] , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT ) according to Pardee and Spudich [ 15 ] and pyrenyl labeled . The yeast Arc40 / ARPC1 - YFP Arp2 / 3 complex was isolated from a strain expressing an Arp3 - CaMBM - tev - ProtA subunit ( RLY1945 ) as previously described [ 16 ] . The unlabeled control complex ( Arp3MH , which has a [ Myc ] 5 His 6 tag on Arp3 [ 16 ] ) as well as the Arp3 - , Arp2 - , and Arc18 / ARPC3 - GFP - His 10 - labeled complexes were isolated as follows . Yeast cells were grown to mid log phase in YPD medium ( OD 600 2 (cid:1) 4 ) washed in U buffer ( 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA ) and stored at (cid:1) 80 8 C until use . A 50 - to 100 - g cell pellet was resuspended in \ufb01ve volumes of cold U buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , and protease inhibitor mix ( 0 . 5 l g / ml antipain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and aprotinin , and 1 mM PMSF ) and passed through a micro\ufb02udizer ( Micro\ufb02uidics , Newton , Massa - chusetts , United States ) until 70 % lysis was obtained . The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 100 , 000 3 g for 1 h and \ufb01ltered through a 0 . 45 - l m \ufb01lter . A 60 % ammonium sulfate precipitation of cell extracts was performed , and the pellet was dialyzed into NaP buffer ( 100 mM phosphate [ pH 7 . 8 ] , 100 mM KCl , and 20 mM imidazole ) . This fraction was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with Ni - NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen , Valencia , California , United States ) . Beads were washed with NaP buffer , NaP buffer plus 0 . 5 M KCl , and NaP buffer plus 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and the complex was eluted with 250 mM imidazole . The complex was further puri\ufb01ed through a HiTrapS column ( Amersham Biosciences , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) in 50 mM MES ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 25 mM NaCl ; a UnoQ1 column ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , California , United States ) in U buffer ; and a Superose 12 gel \ufb01ltration column ( Amersham Biosciences ) in U buffer on a BioLogic chromatography system ( Bio - Rad ) . Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex was puri\ufb01ed by poly ( L ) - proline [ 18 ] and gel \ufb01ltration chromatography as described [ 19 ] . Puri\ufb01ed complexes were immedi - ately used to assemble actin branches or stored in U buffer Figure 4 .

Bovine GST - N - WASp WA , bovine GST - N - WASp , murine GST - cortactin , and murine GST - Nck were puri\ufb01ed as previously described [ 20 , 21 ] . MBP - Scar1 WA was generated by fusing Scar1 S495 \u2013 C559 to MBP followed by a C - terminal His 6 ( E . Kim and D . H . , unpublished data ) . Pyrene - actin polymerization assays . Pyrene - actin polymerization assays were performed at Harvard Medical School and repeated at the Burnham Institute . Typically , G - actin was clari\ufb01ed at 436 , 000 3 g for 30 min . Reactions were performed by mixing 2 l M Mg 2 \u00fe - ATP - G - actin ( 10 % pyrene labeled ) with Arp2 / 3 complex and the appropriate NPF , and actin polymerization was initiated in 1 3 KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 02 % azide , and 2 mM imidazole [ pH 7 . 0 ] ) . Polymerization was followed using a \ufb02uorescence spectrophotometer ( Cary Eclipse Varian at Harvard Medical School and an MOS - 250 spectro\ufb02uorometer [ Bio - Logic , Claix , France ] equipped with BioKine 32 software at the Burnham Institute ) , using 365 nm as the excitation wavelength and 407 nm as the emission wavelength . All of the GFP - labeled complexes were used at 50 to 200 nM concentration with 100 to 200 nM GST - N - WASp WA . When the reaction reached the plateau , 2 l M phalloidin was added to stabilize the branches , and the reaction was diluted as required in F buffer ( 5 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 7 . 8 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT ) . The slight reduction in the polymerization rate with Arc18 / ARPC3 - GFP complex was due to frozen storage of the complex . This reduction was not observed with fresh complex ( data not shown ) , which was used to obtain the actin branches studied using EM . For the NPF detection experiments , we used the following conditions . Yeast actin branches were assembled with 2 l M actin with 25 \u2013 50 nM yeast Arp2 / 3 complex activated by either 250 nM N - WASp WA , 250 nM GST - N - WASp WA , or 125 nM GST - N - WASp / 250 nM GST - Nck . Amoeba actin branches were assembled with 2 l M actin with 100 nM amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex activated by either 200 nM Scar WA , 200 nM MBP - Scar WA , or 200 nM GST - cortactin . No actin polymerization was observed when 2 l M G - actin is incubated with 25 \u2013 50 nM yeast or 100 nM amoeba complexes ( data not shown ) . Activation of the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - cortactin was signi\ufb01cantly weaker than the activation observed with Scar WA or MBP - Scar WA . Electron microscopy . Freshly puri\ufb01ed Arp2 / 3 complexes were used to assemble actin \ufb01lament branches , which were applied to glow - discharged EM carbon - coated grids and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . Images were recorded under low - dose conditions at a magni\ufb01cation of 42 , 000 and at a defocus of 1 . 8 l m using a Tecnai 12 G2 microscope ( FEI , Hillsboro , Oregon , United States ) equipped with a Lab6 \ufb01lament at 120 kV and a 1 , 024 3 1 , 024 MSC 600HP ( model 794 ; Gatan , Pleasanton , California , United States ) . The pixel size was 0 . 57 nm . Branches were selected and boxed using EMAN [ 22 ] . Image analysis was performed independently by two different experimentalists ( I . R . and X . - P . X . ) , using two different image analysis packages : Spider [ 23 ] and EMAN [ 22 ] . Results were compared only at the end of the analysis . Image processing and cross - validation . For alignment using Spider , selected branches were aligned with a reference - based alignment procedure using standard alignment protocols implemented in Spider [ 23 ] . The initial reference was a well - stained branch chosen from the dataset . After alignment , branches were inspected visually , outliers ( branches that obviously were not aligned ) were discarded , and aligned branches were averaged . This new average was used for another round of alignment . This process was repeated until no more changes were observed ( typically three or four times ) . For several datasets ( Arp2 - GFP , full - length N - WASp , and cortactin ) , three different initial references ( two different branches and the average obtained with the control ) were used . Comparison of the different \ufb01nal averages for individual datasets showed that they were practi - cally identical ( and the difference map between the average and the control maps showed the same difference peaks ) , i . e . , the \ufb01nal average was not biased by the choice of the initial reference . The other datasets were aligned to one or two initial references and the results were cross - validated with the results from EMAN ( see below ) . Of 109 branches , 103 were included in the unlabeled yeast Arp2 / 3complex with GST - N - WASp WA averaging , 169 ( of 170 ) in the unlabeled yeast Arp2 / 3 with N - WASp WA averaging , 111 ( of 121 ) in the unlabeled yeast Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - N - WASp and GST - Nck averaging , 204 ( of 211 ) in the Arc40 / ARPC1 - YFP averaging , 173 ( of 188 ) in the Arp2 - GFP averaging , 158 ( of 163 ) in the Arp3 - GFP averaging , 162 ( of 165 ) in the Arc18 / ARPC3 - GFP averaging , 205 ( of 211 ) in the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with Scar WA averaging , 135 ( of 147 ) in the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with MBP - Scar WA averaging , and 250 ( of 284 ) in the amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - cortactin averaging . For alignment using EMAN , for the dataset of the unlabeled yeast Arp2 / 3 branches in the presence of N - WASp WA and amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of Scar WA , initial references with good quality ( straight and with high contrast ) were picked from the respective dataset . Projection maps were generated using the correlation - based iterative alignment algorithm and outlier screening implemented in EMAN [ 22 ] . To further reduce model bias , the procedure was repeated for nine different references each . The \ufb01nal projection maps were generated by aligning and averaging the respective nine maps . For all other datasets , the \ufb01nal projection map of either the amoeba complex in the presence of Scar WA ( for amoeba - based samples ) or yeast complex in the presence of N - WASp WA ( for yeast - based samples ) was used as the initial reference . The individual branches used for the analysis ( \ufb01nal projection maps versus the total boxed branches ) are for Arp2 - GFP ( 84 / 98 ) , Arp3 - GFP ( 110 / 159 ) , Arc18 / ARPC3 - GFP ( 109 / 154 ) , Arc40 / ARPC1 - YFP ( 134 / 178 ) , unlabeled Arp2 / 3 complex with N - WASp WA ( 105 / 157 ) , unlabeled Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - N - WASp WA ( 76 / 101 ) , unlabeled yeast Arp2 / 3 complex with full - length GST - N - WASp with GST - Nck ( 60 / 82 ) , amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with Scar WA ( 146 / 200 ) , amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with MBP - Scar WA ( 94 / 132 ) , and amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex with GST - cortactin ( 187 / 254 ) . Averaging and signi\ufb01cance testing . The aligned images selected for averaging ( separately for the Spider and EMAN sets ) were normalized and averaged using routines from CoAn [ 24 ] . CoAn was also used to calculate the difference maps and the standardized variance maps that are suitable for input to Student\u2019s t - test procedures [ 25 ] . All tests were performed at a con\ufb01dence level of 99 . 5 % . All peaks presented were statistically signi\ufb01cant and virtually at the same location in the two independent image analyses . Fitting of constraints and precision estimate . In order to computa - tionally \ufb01t the constraints obtained by labeling , we adapted routines from the CoAn package [ 24 ] that were previously used in the context of density \ufb01tting and subsequent evaluation of 3D real - space constraints derived from mutagenesis and biochemistry experiments [ 26 ] . The routines , which perform a global scan of the orientations , were modi\ufb01ed to handle 2D constraints . After applying a rotation to the crystal structure of the inactive Arp2 / 3 complex , the positions of Table 1 .

Then , a translational least - squares \ufb01t between the projected C - termini and the respective constraints ( in - plane positions of the labels , one constraint each for Arc40 / ARPC1 , Arc18 / ARPC3 , and Arp3 and two for Arp2 ) was performed . Next , the distances between the C - termini projections and the respective constraints were tested using a predetermined cut - off value . If the distance was below this value , the orientation was kept for further processing . A complete global scan using a 10 8 increment with this con\ufb01guration completes within 3 min on an Athlon Opteron dual processor box . An advantage of a global scan versus the more traditional least - squares \ufb01tting is that all solutions that satisfy the constraints are mapped and can be used for solution set analysis similar to that used for density - based docking [ 27 ] . To determine an estimate for the uncertainty of the orientation in three dimensions , we used the following procedure . The length of the linker and the 3D structures of GFP and YFP determine that the ( projected ) distance between the respective C - terminus and the difference peak ( assumed to represent the center of the GFP / YFP ) can be anywhere between 0 and 6 nm . A priori , we do not know which value to choose , but we can use the following argument to \ufb01nd the most appropriate cut - off . The set of 3D orientations that satisfy the constraints at a certain cut - off value can be used to calculate a central orientation ( centroid ) that minimizes the average root - mean - square deviation to all other members of the solution set . If the cut - off value is too small , the constraints are too tight and the centroid will be biased toward the tightest constraint . If the cut - off value is too large , the centroid will not change , but the solution set will be too large and give unrealistically large estimates of precision . Thus , the most appropriate cut - off distance is the smallest value that still gives the same centroid orientation as larger values . The solution set from this value can be used to get an estimate of the precision for the orientation determination by calculating the average root - mean - square deviation in the set . Using this procedure with test cut - off values between 1 and 6 nm , we found that the most appropriate cut - off value is 3 . 9 nm . The centroid orientation ( which is the one presented in Figure 4 ) has an average in - plane distance between the C - termini and the respective peaks of 2 . 43 nm ( Arp3 : 2 . 59 nm ; Arp2 : 2 . 98 and 3 . 48 nm ; Arc40 / ARPC1 : 1 . 30 nm ; Arc18 / ARPC3 : 1 . 78 nm ; see also Figure 3 ) . The precision of the 3D orientation was estimated from the solution set as 0 . 99 nm . Molecular graphics . In Figure 4 , the low - resolution representations of the Arp2 / 3 complex were generated from the crystal structure [ 12 ] . Coordinates for domains I and II of Arp2 are not available owing to disorder in the crystal structure . We substituted these two domains by subdomains 1 and 2 of an actin monomer [ 28 ] after least - squares \ufb01tting of subdomains 3 and 4 of actin to domains III and IV of Arp2 .

Sorting the Population of the Arp2 - GFP Branches The Arp2 - GFP branches were sorted based on the density values in the two areas ( pink peaks shown in Figure 3C and 3F ) . For each peak , the density within the peak area was measured for every aligned branch image . This resulted in distinct bimodal distributions with one peak at high values ( peak present ) and another at low values ( peak absent ) . The bimodal character of the distribution indicates that we indeed have a systematic difference ; otherwise , a single Gaussian distribution would occur . The averages were then calculated from the subpopulation with high values only . ( A - C ) Difference map obtained from all Arp2 - GFP branches .

  "avinoam2015endocytic": "ENDOCYTOSIS Endocytic sites mature by continuous bending and remodeling of the clathrin coat Ori Avinoam , 1 , 2 Martin Schorb , 2 , 3 Carsten J . Beese , 1 John A . G . Briggs , 2 , 1 * Marko Kaksonen 1 , 2 * \u2020 During clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , plasma membrane regions are internalized to retrieve extracellular molecules and cell surface components . Whether endocytosis occurs by direct clathrin assembly into curved lattices on the budding vesicle or by initial recruitment to flat membranes and subsequent reshaping has been controversial . To distinguish between these models , we combined fluorescence microscopy and electron tomography to locate endocytic sites and to determine their coat and membrane shapes during invagination . The curvature of the clathrin coat increased , whereas the coated surface area remained nearly constant . Furthermore , clathrin rapidly exchanged at all stages of CME . Thus , coated vesicle budding appears to involve bending of a dynamic preassembled clathrin coat . C lathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is es - sentialforabroadrangeofcellularprocesses , includingnutrientuptake , signaltransduc - tion , synapticvesiclerecycling , andimmune responses ( 1 , 2 ) . It initiates with cargo bind - ing by adaptor proteins that recruit clathrin on the plasma membrane , followed by membrane invagination , which leads to dynamin - dependent scission of a coated vesicle ( 3 , 4 ) . Clathrin trimers have a triskelion shape and can assemble into heterogeneous polyhedral coats ( 5 ) . The relation between coat assembly and membrane invagina - tion is poorly understood . Two alternative models describethetransitionfromplanarmembranetoclathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) . The first \u2014 derived from electron microscopy images showing both relatively flat and invaginated clathrin lattices in cells \u2014 suggests that clathrin assembles as a planar lattice that subsequently bends as the membrane invaginates ( 6 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . For this to happen , complex rearrangements within the clathrin network must occur during budding . The second model avoids this difficulty by pro - posing that large , flat clathrin lattices are not precursors of CME and that , at sites of CME , clathrindirectlyassemblestoproducethecurvedcoatasthemembraneinvaginates ( 7 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . To study clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) maturation , we used well - characterized genome - edited hu - man cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged clathrin light chain A at endogenous concen - trations ( 8 , 9 ) ( hCLTA EN ) ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . To distinguish late stages of CME , we used cells that coexpressed endogenously tagged dynamin - 2 ( 9 ) ( hCLTA EN / hDNM2 EN ) ( Fig . 1B ) . To label CCPs that recruit cargo , we incubated cells with fluo - rescently labeled transferrin ( TF ) , a constitutive cargo of CME ( hCLTA EN / TF ) ( Fig . 1C ) . CME events imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy showed a buildup of clathrin fluorescence that reached a plateau before a burst of dynamin preceded the site \u2019 s disappear - ance , as previously described ( 8 , 10 ) ( Fig . 1 , B and C , and movies S1 and S2 ) . To distinguish between the models of coat as - sembly , we applied a correlative fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) and electron tomography ( ET ) method to locate CCPs precisely and to obtain three - dimensional information about their shape ( 11 \u2013 13 ) ( Fig . 1DandmoviesS3 toS5 ) . Weobtained , in total , 233 tomographic reconstructions of sites where a clathrin signal was detected at the cell periphery ( 117 from hCLTA EN / hDNM2 EN and 116 from hCLTA EN / TF ) . In all cases , the fluorescent signalcorrelatedwithanendocyticsitewithaclear membrane coat ( 13 ) . When the coat lay parallel to the imaging plane , the characteristic polygonal architecture of polymerized clathrin was visible ( Fig . 1E and fig . S1 ) . We analyzed 199 CCPs and 27 CCVs corresponding to different stages of CME ( Fig . 1F ) ( 13 ) . To characterize changes in membrane shape , we extracted the membrane and coat profiles andanalyzedthemcomputationally ( 12 , 13 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . We determined the invagination depth , tip curva - ture , and coated membrane area . When a con - stricted neck was detected at the base of the invagination , wemeasuredneckwidthandheight ( 13 ) ( Fig . 2B and tables S1 and S2 ) . We further determined the maximal angle ( q ) between the adjacent plasma membrane ( PM ) and the invagi - nating segment of the membrane ( Fig . 2B ) . Inde - pendently of invagination size and which model is correct , q will increase during invagination from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 in a U - shaped invagination before tend - ing to 180\u00b0 at neck constriction and scission ( 13 ) ( Figs . 1A and 2B and movie S6 ) . q is therefore a surrogate for CCP stage and was used to order CCPs from early to late . We detected no apparent morphological dif - ferences between the cargo - labeled CCPs from hCLTA EN / TF and the CCPs observed in hCLTA EN / hDNM2 EN cells ( fig . S2 ) and , unless stated other - wise , we pooled the data from these data sets . Dynamin - positive sites consisted exclusively of deep invaginations with a neck and clustered at late stages of CME ( ~ q > 90\u00b0 ; depth , 68 to 155 nm ) ( Fig . 3 , A and B , and fig . S3 ) . The high precision of correlation allowed us to localize dynamin to the base of the invagination close to the PM ( 13 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . Dynamin - associated necks had widths of up to 121 nm , which greatly exceeded the diameter of assembled dynamin rings in vitro ( < 30 nm ) ( 14 ) ; these findings sug - gested that dynamin recruitment and neck con - striction begin before ring formation . If clathrin directly assembles into the curved coat by addition of triskelia during membrane invagination , then the coated membrane area should grow as sites mature . In contrast , we found that the coated membrane area in CCPs did not appreciably change during budding and did not differ significantly between CCPs and CCVs ( Fig . 3C and figs . S1C and S2 , C and D ) . This suggests that enough clathrin is recruited before invagi - nation to coat a complete vesicle . Furthermore , if clathrin directly assembles into the curved coat , then the tip curvature of CCPs would remain constant during budding and would be the same as that in the resultant CCVs . In contrast , our analysis showed that tip curvature continuously increased during invagination ( Fig . 3 , D and E , and fig . S2E ) . These results show that the cur - vature of CCPs increases , whereas the surface area remains largely constant . These properties are only consistent with the model where clathrin is initially deposited on a nearly planar membrane followed by subsequent membrane bending . In order to bend , flat lattices composed pri - marily of hexagons must acquire pentagons re - quiring extensive molecular rearrangements and removal of triskelia ( 7 , 15 ) . It has been reported previouslythatclathrinexchangesatCCPs ( 16 , 17 ) . However , it is unclear if , and at what stages , this occurs during canonical CME . To test this , we performedfluorescencerecoveryafterphotobleach - ing ( FRAP ) analysis of individual CCPs ( 13 ) while simultaneously imaging clathrin and dynamin ( Fig . 4A and movie S7 ) . Clathrin fluorescence re - covered rapidly , reaching 60 % recovery with a half time of ~ 2 s , both before and after dynamin recruitment ( Fig . 4 , B and C , and fig . S4 ) . This indicates that clathrin is exchanging at early and late stages of CME and explains why blocking clathrin turnover arrests CCPs at all stages ( 18 ) . Although fluorescence intensity profiles of indi - vidual CCPs display considerable heterogeneity in assembly kinetics and overall persistence at the plasma membrane , recent analysis has shown that clathrin displays an initiation and growth phase , followed by a plateau in which fluores - cence intensity is at its maximum ( 10 , 19 ) . Our correlated FM and ET data showed that clathrin recruitmentoccursbeforemembraneinvagination , SCIENCE sciencemag . org 19 JUNE 2015 (cid:129) VOL 348 ISSUE 6241 1369 1 Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit , The European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg 69117 , Germany . 2 Structural and Computational Biology Unit , The European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg 69117 , Germany . 3 Electron Microscopy Core Facility , The European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg 69117 , Germany . * Corresponding author .

Numerous EM studies have documented a population of flat clathrin lattices that could potentially evolve into single vesicles ( 6 , 20 ) . It is likely that these lattices correspond to the early CCPs observed here . Subdomains of the larger clathrin lattices that exist in some cell types may also undergo local rearrangements to produce vesicles ( 20 , 21 ) . 1370 19 JUNE 2015 (cid:129) VOL 348 ISSUE 6241 sciencemag . org SCIENCE \u03b8 Max . angle Neckheight D i s t an c e ne ck t o t i p Neck width C o a t e d s u r f a c e a r e a T i p c u r v a t u r e I n v ag i na t i on dep t h - 100 0 100 0 100 ( nm ) ( n m ) - 100 0 100 - 50 0 50 100 150 ( nm ) ( n m ) Fig . 2 .

Mango 1 * Pioneer transcription factors initiate cell - fate changes by binding to silent target genes . They are among the first factors to bind key regulatory sites and facilitate chromatin opening . Here , we identify an additional role for pioneer factors . In early Caenorhabditis elegans foregut development , the pioneer factor PHA - 4 / FoxA binds promoters and recruits RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) , often in a poised configuration in which Pol II accumulates near transcription start sites . At a later developmental stage , PHA - 4 promotes chromatin opening . We found many more genes with poised RNA polymerase than had been observed previously in unstaged embryos , revealing that early embryos accumulate poised Pol II and that poising is dynamic . Our results suggest that Pol II recruitment , in addition to chromatin opening , is an important feature of PHA - 4 pioneer factor activity . E mbryonic development depends on precise patterns of gene expression that are orches - trated by key transcription factors such as pioneer transcription factors . Pioneer fac - tors function at the earliest stage of tran - scriptional onset to facilitate chromatin opening at cis - regulatory sites , which enables additional factors to bind DNA ( 1 ) . The founding pioneer factorismammalianFoxA1 , whichassociateswith liver genes and promotes chromatin accessibility before transcriptional activation . In vitro , FoxA proteins bind nucleosomes and block chromatin compaction by H1 linker histones ( 1 ) , and in vivo FoxA proteins open chromatin with the his - tone variant H2A . Z ( 2 ) . It is unknown whether chromatin opening is the sole mechanism of transcriptional priming induced by pioneer transcription factors . In Caenorhabditis elegans , pha - 4 encodes a se - lector gene that specifies foregut fate ( 3 ) . pha - 4 is orthologous to FoxA proteins ( 4 , 5 ) and interacts with H2A . Z ( 2 ) , raising the question of whether pha - 4 functions as a pioneer transcription factor in addition to its selector activities . We performed five tests that revealed that pha - 4 had pioneer activity . First , PHA - 4 associated with target genes M05B5 . 2 , ceh - 22 , and myo - 2 beginning at the 8E stage ( \u201c E \u201d for endodermal cells ) , when PHA - 4 was first detected ( Fig . 1 , A and B , and fig . S1A ) . We observed binding to promoters that are activated atearly , mid - , orlateembryogenesisandconfirmed thatthemid - ( ceh - 22 ) andlate - stage ( myo - 2 ) genes were not expressed in our 8E sample ( gastru - lation stage ) . These data indicate that PHA - 4 associates with endogenous foregut promoters hours before transcriptional onset , which is as expected for a pioneer factor . Second , we deter - mined that PHA - 4 bound nucleosomal DNA in vitro equivalently to its orthologs FoxA1 and FoxA2 ( Fig . 1C ) . Third , chromatin sites bound by PHA - 4 in vivo [ measured with chromatin immu - noprecipitation ( ChIP ) ] ( 6 ) lacked stable nucleo - somes [ measured with formaldehyde - assisted isolation of regulatory elements ( FAIRE ) ] ( fig . S1C ) ( 7 ) , indicating PHA - 4 association with open chro - matin . Moreover , regions bound by PHA - 4 were enriched for activating histone marks H3K4me2 , H3K4me3 , and acetylated H3K27 ( fig . S1C ) ( 8 ) . Fourth , single - cell analysis with artificial chromo - somes ( Fig . 1D ) revealed that chromatin was open in the foregut , where PHA - 4 is expressed , but not in other cell types , which lack PHA - 4 , nor with a target promoter bearing a mutated PHA - 4 - binding site ( Fig . 1E ) ( 9 ) . Fifth , we tracked PHA - 4 associa - tion with chromatin during mitosis and observed that a portion of PHA - 4 was retained on DNA in dividing foregut cells ( fig . S2 ) ( 10 ) . Together , the results reveal that PHA - 4 fulfilled the criteria of a pioneer transcription factor ( Fig . 1 and fig . S1B ) . It associated withbindingsitesearlyindevelopment , bound DNA packaged in nucleosomes in vitro , and decompacted chromatin in vivo . To examine the role of PHA - 4 in transcrip - tion , we mapped Pol II occupancy by means of genome - wide ChIP - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) . Previ - ous studies with C . elegans Pol II had focused on relatively late time points , after transcription was established for many genes ( 6 , 11 ) . Our interest was earlier stages , before transcriptional onset . We analyzed early embryos after PHA - 4 bound to target genes but before their transcription ( ~ 8Estage ) andcomparedthoseembryostomid - stage , transcriptionallyactiveembryos ( beanstage ) ( staging is provided in fig . S3 ) . To localize Pol II , we mapped its position relative to the transcrip - tion start site ( TSS ) ( 11 ) and calculated three scores : promoter occupancy for Pol II spanning the TSS ( Fig . 2A ) , Pol II within gene bodies ( Fig . 2B ) , and the poising index as the ratio of the promoter to the gene body values ( Fig . 2C ) . The poising index reflects the relative quantity of 1372 19 JUNE 2015 (cid:129) VOL 348 ISSUE 6241 sciencemag . org SCIENCE 1 Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , USA . 2 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA . 3 Department of Biochemistry , University at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , USA . 4 Department of Physics and Center for Systems Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , USA . 5 Department of Biostatistics , University at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY 14214 , USA . * Corresponding author .

Despite this , the question remains : Does clathrin bind to the membrane as a flat lattice and then bend during coated pit invagination , or does clathrin assemble with a defined curvature as membranes invaginate ? Avinoam et al . applied two state - of - the - art imaging approaches to resolve this conflict . They suggest that clathrin assembles into a defined flat lattice early in endocytosis , which predetermines the size of the vesicle . The assembled clathrin coat then rearranges through dynamic exchange of clathrin with the cytosolic pool to wrap around the forming vesicle .

An experimentally constrained multiscale model shows that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension . Around 200 activated Arp2 / 3 complexes are required for robust internalization . A newly developed molecule - counting method determined that ~ 200 Arp2 / 3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in human cells . Simulations predict that actin self - organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit . Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit . Elastic energy stored in bent filaments , whose presence was confirmed by cryo - electron tomography , contributes to endocytic internalization . Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit , increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production . Thus , spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints . Introduction Cells polymerize actin filaments to produce force and provide mechanical integrity for a variety of cellular processes , from cytokinesis and cell migration , to membrane reshaping and trafficking ( Pol - lard , 2016 ) . For each cellular process , actin filaments organize into a specific geometry that confers structural integrity and force - generation capacity . Most membrane deformation processes use branched actin networks nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , a branched actin filament network nucle - ator ( Carlsson , 2018 ; Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . On a large ( m m ) length scale , branched actin networks drive the plasma membrane forward during cell migration , such that on the scale of individual actin branches , the membrane shape can be thought of as more or less constant ( Keren et al . , 2008 ; Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Schaus et al . , 2007 ) . However , on a smaller ( sub - micron ) length scale , branched actin networks deform many cellular membranes as part of organelle and vesicle biogene - sis and function ( Rottner et al . , 2017 ) . The relationship between cellular membrane curvature and local actin assembly for each of these \u2018local\u2019 membrane - deformation processes remains relatively unexplored ( Daste et al . , 2017 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is an especially attractive process for studies of actin\u2019s role in membrane shape changes due to the relatively complete parts list and available quantitative infor - mation about the positions , recruitment timing and biochemical function of many of the participating proteins ( Arasada et al . , 2018 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . CME is a ubiqui - tous and essential cellular process by which cells take macromolecules from the extracellular space and the plasma membrane into the cell interior ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . During CME , the Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 1 of 40 RESEARCH ARTICLE plasma membrane is bent , pinched , and pulled inward in a time frame of ~ 60 s thereby transitioning from a flat sheet into a spherical vesicle ~ 100 nm in diameter . Clathrin and its adaptor proteins establish a coat that generates initial membrane curvature ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Pearse , 1976 ; Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) , and BAR ( bin - amphiphysin - rvs ) - domain proteins bind curved membranes and support further membrane curvature ( Buser and Drubin , 2013 ; David et al . , 1996 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . During yeast endocytosis , branched actin filaments provide the force required for membrane tubule formation ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Wang and Carlsson , 2017 ) . In metazoan cells , endocytic pits under high tension stall at a \u2018U\u2019 - shaped intermediate in the absence of functional actin ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , implying that actin is required to generate plasma mem - brane shape changes late in CME ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Yoshida et al . , 2018 ) . The molecular mechanism by which a network of polarized , branched actin filaments assembles at these sites for productive force generation is poorly understood . Actin network assembly is known to play a key role in membrane shape change in some contexts . For example , mathematical modeling ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; Carlsson and Bayly , 2014 ; Dmitrieff and Ne\u00b4de\u00b4lec , 2015 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) and quantitative fluores - cence imaging in yeast ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) have established the relationship between actin filament assembly and plasma membrane shape particular to fungi , which have unique mechanical requirements due to very high ( ~ 10 atm ) hydrostatic turgor pressure . However , less is known about actin organization and function in the lower force regime characteristic of metazoan cells . A multiscale modeling effort that accounts for the mechanics of single actin filaments and that is constrained by experimental measurements of actin dynamics , spatial organization of the filaments , and tension in the plasma membrane is required to gain insight into actin organization and force generation capacity . We hypothesize that in localized membrane - reshaping processes such as endocytosis , branched actin networks assemble under specific spatial \u2018boundary conditions , \u2019 which serve as geometrical constraints dictated both by the shape of the membrane and the spatial segregation of membrane - associated proteins that inter - act with actin . These unique spatial boundary conditions on a curved surface , combined with the knowledge of numbers of molecules in cells and known reaction rate constants , provide the eLife digest The outer membrane of a cell is a tight but elastic barrier that controls what enters or leaves the cell . Large molecules typically cannot cross this membrane unaided . Instead , to enter the cell , they must be packaged into a pocket of the membrane that is then pulled inside . This process , called endocytosis , shuttles material into a cell hundreds of times a minute . Endocytosis relies on molecular machines that assemble and disassemble at the membrane as required . One component , a protein called actin , self - assembles near the membrane into long filaments with many repeated subunits . These filaments grow against the membrane , pulling it inwards . But it was not clear how actin filaments organize in such a way that allows them to pull on the membrane with enough force \u2013 and without a template to follow . Akamatsu et al . set about identifying how actin operates during endocytosis by using computer simulations that were informed by measurements made in living cells . The simulations included information about the location of actin and other essential molecules , along with the details of how these molecules work individually and together . Akamatsu et al . also developed a method to count the numbers of molecules of a key protein at individual sites of endocytosis . High - resolution imaging was then used to create 3D pictures of actin and endocytosis in action in human cells grown in the laboratory . The analysis showed the way actin filaments arrange themselves depends on the starting positions of a few key molecules that connect to actin . Imaging confirmed that , like a pole - vaulting pole , the flexible actin filaments bend to store energy and then release it to pull the membrane inwards during endocytosis . Finally , the simulations predicted that the collection of filaments adapts its shape and size in response to the resistance of the elastic membrane . This makes the system opportunistic and adaptable to the unpredictable environment within cells . Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 .

Using this framework , we sought to answer the following questions : How do branched actin net - works assemble , organize , and produce force around an endocytic pit ? How does the spatial segre - gation of Arp2 / 3 complex activators ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ) and actin - binding proteins associated with endocytic coats ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) influence this organization ? And finally , how do endo - cytic actin networks adapt to changing loads due to the stochastic environment and changes in membrane tension ? To answer these questions , we combined live - cell molecule counting methods in genome - edited diploid human cells and cryo - electron tomography of intact cells with multiscale modeling of plasma membrane mechanics and actin filament dynamics . Our results show that a mini - mal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension . Actin filament self - organization and bending , which arise from the spatial distribution of actin - coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit , allow the actin net - work to adapt to changing loads . We anticipate that the mechanistic insights gained for actin in mammalian endocytosis will also apply to a variety of local membrane - bending processes carried out by branched actin throughout the cell . Results Multiscale modeling shows that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against physiological membrane tension We combined a continuum - mechanics model of the plasma membrane , an agent - based model of actin filament dynamics , quantitative fluorescence microscopy , and electron tomography in cells to determine the molecular mechanism by which branched actin networks produce force during mam - malian clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Figure 1 , Scheme 1 ) . First , we used a continuum - mechanics model of the plasma membrane ( Alimohamadi et al . , 2018 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Rangamani et al . , 2014 ) to determine the force - extension relation - ship for clathrin - coated pits stalled at a U - shaped intermediate under high membrane tension ( Figure 1B ) . Here , the extension refers to the extent of pit internalization , which is a displacement in the - Z direction ( Figure 1A \u2013 B ) . Previously , we showed that membrane curvature generation by the endocytic coat during vesicle formation could snap the membrane into a pinched \u2018omega\u2019 shape as a function of membrane tension and the curvature induced by the coat ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) , but we did not focus on force produced by the actin cytoskeleton . Here , we modeled the coated mem - brane based on the Helfrich ( 1973 ) energy and applied a linear force to the clathrin - coated pit in increasing value over successive simulations , corresponding to a simplified actin force . Simulations demonstrated that a clathrin - coated pit experiences a nearly linear force - extension relationship until an internalization of ~ 100 nm , at which point the pit can also adopt a pinched ( or \u2018omega\u2019 ) shape , which requires a lower force ( Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014video 1 ) . We calculated the resistance to internalization as the slope of the force - extension plot for the linear regime and found that it is directly proportional to plasma membrane tension for a wide range of coat rigidities ( Figure 1D ) . Importantly , this direct scaling between resistance to internalization and membrane tension allowed us to treat this step of endocytic pit internalization as a linear spring , with the spring constant cali - brated using measurements of plasma membrane tension in mammalian cells ( Diz - Mun\u02dcoz et al . , 2016 ; Kaplan et al . , in preparation ) . The simple spring - like relationship uncovered above between force and endocytic pit internaliza - tion ( Figure 1D ) allowed us to simplify our mechanical treatment of the plasma membrane while modeling individual actin filaments and actin - binding proteins with realistic kinetics and mechanics ( Figure 1E \u2013 G , Supplementary file 3 ) . We used Cytosim ( Nedelec and Foethke , 2007 ) to construct a filament - based model of the endocytic actin network . This agent - based model allowed us to simu - late the emergent architecture and mechanical functions of branched actin for realistic endocytic geometries . Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 .

The following rules were prescribed for actin filament dynamics . Initially , actin filament - nucleating proteins seed a small num - ber of actin filaments near the endocytic pit . These randomly - oriented \u2018mother filaments\u2019 serve as templates for binding pre - activated Arp2 / 3 complexes , which correspond to the coincidence of Arp2 / 3 complex and its activator N - WASP , arranged in a ring ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ) at the base of the endocytic pit ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Kaplan et al . , in preparation ) . When an active Arp2 / 3 complex comes in proximity Figure 1 continued force ( red arrows ) is applied downward from the coat and upward into the base of the endocytic pit ( red dotted lines ) . In this simulation , membrane tension was 0 . 2 pN / nm , and the coated area was rigid ( 2400 pN ! nm ) .

Resistance ( spring constant ) is defined as absolute value of slope in C for the \u2018U - shaped\u2019 region . Each curve is calculated for a different value of membrane rigidity ( where 1x = 320 pN ! nm , the rigidity of the uncoated plasma membrane ) .

An internalizing endocytic pit is modeled as a sphere with a neck attached to a flat surface by a spring . Active Arp2 / 3 complex ( blue ) is distributed in a ring around the base of the pit . An actin nucleation protein ( pink ) generates an actin filament ( white ) , which polymerizes , stalls under load , and is stochastically capped ( red ) . Arp2 / 3 complexes bind to the sides of actin filaments and nucleate new filaments at a 77 - degree angle , creating new branches .

Growing actin filaments can polymerize , diffuse under thermal fluctuations , and bend under force , and their growing ends are capped stochastically . Filament growth decreases with load according to the Brownian ratchet mechanism ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ; Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . Growth of the actin network is coupled to internalization of the endocytic pit by an actin - linking protein ( Hip1 / Hip1R / Epsin , simplified here as Hip1R ) , which is embedded in the coated pit and binds to actin filaments ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . Importantly , most of the parameters in this model have been determined with measurements in vitro or in vivo , includ - ing the dimensions of the endocytic pit , its resistance to internalization ( modeled as a spring , Figure 1D ) , rates of association and dissociation of different proteins , branching angles , capping rates , filament persistence length , and stall force ( Supplementary file 3 and Materials and methods ) . Stochastic simulations of the model showed that this minimal branched actin network internalizes endocytic pits up to ~ 60 nm against physiological membrane tension ( Figure 1F and Figure 1\u2014 video 2 ) . In order to compare different conditions , we used two metrics \u2013 internalization of the pit ( in nm ) over time ( Figure 1G ) and the 95th percentile of internalization ( Figure 1\u2014figure supple - ment 1A ) . Then , we evaluated the robustness of the model to different parameters by conducting a series of parameter sweeps ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We found that the extent of internali - zation is robust to a wide range of parameters , including filament stiffness , stall force , and affinity between Hip1R attachments and actin filaments ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Initiating the sim - ulations from a cytoplasmic pool of linear actin filaments ( Raz - Ben Aroush et al . , 2017 ) allowed for endocytosis but the timing of the onset of internalization was more variable ( Figure 1\u2014figure sup - plement 2 ) . The extent of internalization was particularly sensitive to the number of available Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Figure 1G ) , indicating a need for precise measurements of this molecule at mammalian endocytic sites . Molecule counting of endogenously GFP - tagged Arp2 / 3 complex in live mammalian cells Motivated by our prediction that internalization rate is sensitive to the number of Arp2 / 3 complexes , we developed a method to count the number of molecules of endogenously GFP - tagged proteins in living mammalian cells ( Figure 2 ) . We adapted the self - assembling GFP - tagged protein nanocages developed by Hsia et al . ( 2016 ) for expression in live cells to create a fluorescence - based calibration curve relating fluorescence intensity of endogenously GFP - tagged proteins to numbers of molecules per endocytic site . Given that the nanocages are derived from bacterial glycolytic enzymes , we made point mutations known to abolish enzymatic activity of the proteins . To slow the diffusion of the intracellular nanocages and facilitate fluorescence measurements , we introduced an inducible dimerization motif to the plasma membrane by fusing the construct to FKBP and coexpressing a pal - mitoylated and myristoylated FRB variant ( Figure 2A ) . The resulting two - component fusion protein transiently associated with the plasma membrane even without rapamycin analog AP21967 , but the extent of association with the plasma membrane increased in a dose - dependent manner with the concentration of AP21967 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A \u2013 B and Figure 3\u2014video 1 ) . We mea - sured the fluorescence intensity of four GFP - tagged nanocages of copy number ranging from 12 to 120 copies of GFP per structure using spinning disk confocal microscopy ( Figure 2B ) . After correct - ing for exposure time ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E \u2013 F ) , uneven illumination intensity , and local background ( Materials and methods ) , the fluorescence intensity per spot was unitary ( Figure 2C ) and directly proportional to the predicted numbers of molecules per structure ( R 2 = 0 . 996 ) ( Figure 2D ) . Using this calibration curve , we measured the numbers of molecules of an E . coli flagel - lar motor protein eGFP - MotB , which resulted in measurements similar to previously published meas - urements ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G \u2013 I ) . Thus , we established the suitability of this method to relate fluorescence intensity of endogenously GFP - tagged proteins to numbers of molecules inside live mammalian cells . To measure the timing , frequency , and numbers of Arp2 / 3 complexes assembling at sites of cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis , we used CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome editing to endogenously tag the C terminus of ArpC3 , a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex , with the fluorescent protein tagGFP2 in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A \u2013 B ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 7 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems induced pluripotent stem cells are diploid and thus suitable for molecule - counting measurements when both alleles of the ArpC3 gene are fused to the gene for GFP . C - terminal GFP tags on ArpC3 are more functional than on other subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ) . Cells tagged at both alleles of the ArpC3 gene had twice the fluorescence intensity of cells with a single allele tagged , suggesting direct proportionality between GFP fluorescence intensity and numbers of molecules ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C \u2013 D ) . These cells also endogenously express a tagRFP - T fusion with the m 2 subunit of the adaptor pro - tein AP2 , allowing us to identify sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . We determined the relative timing of AP2 and ArpC3 appearance at endocytic sites using time - lapse TIRF imaging and automated two - color particle tracking ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ; Figure 2F ) . The vast majority ( 81 \u00b1 10 % , n = 136 ) of CME events marked by AP2 - RFP culminated in a burst of ArpC3 - GFP fluorescence , prior to internalization of the pit , persisting until the pit internalized ( Figure 2G and Figure 2\u2014video 2 ) . In addition , 24 \u00b1 4 % of ArpC3 - GFP tracks ( n = 145 ) did not colocalize with AP2 . We hypothesize that these are sites of clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis . Then , using spinning - disk confocal fluorescence microscopy , we compared the fluorescence intensities of ArpC3 - GFP spots and GFP - tagged nanocage proteins in cells to deter - mine the numbers of ArpC3 - GFP molecules at clathrin - mediated endocytosis sites ( Figure 2H ) . Thus , we determined that ~ 200 molecules of Arp2 / 3 complex accumulate at clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis sites over time ( Figure 2I ) . Self - organization of actin filaments into a radial dendritic network drives endocytic internalization Incorporating the Arp2 / 3 molecule number we determined experimentally into our multiscale model , we next conducted simulations of the model to investigate the spatial organization of actin and force generation capacity of the endocytic network ( Figure 3 ) . Strikingly , the actin network self - organized around the endocytic pit . This self - organized network drove the assembly of 150 \u00b1 30 actin filaments ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) containing 5700 \u00b1 1100 monomers ( Figure 3\u2014figure supple - ment 1B ) . Interestingly , only a small number of actin filaments ( < 5 ) grew at any given time because the filaments became capped soon after they were nucleated ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Rangamani et al . , 2011 ; Xiong et al . , 2010 ) . Filament lengths were expo - nentially distributed with a final length of 90 \u00b1 80 nm ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D \u2013 E ) . Actin fil - aments bound to 120 \u00b1 10 Hip1R molecules in the coat ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . The endocytic pit internalized ~ 60 nm in 10 \u2013 15 s ( Figure 3A and D ) . Based on the initial geometry of the endocytic pit and activated Arp2 / 3 complex , branched actin filaments self - organized into a radial dendritic network : the network attached to the clathrin coat by binding to Hip1R , the pointed ( minus ) ends localized close to the pit and the barbed ( plus ) ends near the base of the pit were ori - ented to grow toward the base of the pit ( Figure 3A \u2013 C and Figure 3\u2014video 1 ) . The axial self - organization of this branched actin network resembles that at the leading edge of cells ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G \u2013 I ; Maly and Borisy , 2001 ; Mueller et al . , 2017 ; Schaus et al . , 2007 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) , with an important difference . Because actin fila - ment attachment sites are located on the coat of the endocytic pit , filaments radiate away from the center of the pit , such that most of the barbed ends orient radially away from the center of the pit rather than toward the coat or neck ( Figure 3E ) . The radial orientation of barbed ends gradually increases from the center of the pit , where there is no preferred orientation , to the periphery , where the barbed end radial orientation is highest ( Figure 3F ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 9 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems filaments increases rapidly after time 0 ( Figure 3G ) . An important consequence of this self - organiza - tion is that , based on the position of Hip1R and the Arp2 / 3 complex , more barbed filament ends localize near the base ( 10 \u00b1 4 ends ) than near the neck of the endocytic pit ( 1 \u00b1 1 ends ) ( Figure 3H ) . These data result in an important prediction from our model : an actin network self - organized as described here will produce an axial force during pit internalization ( Figure 3I ) . We predict that the radial dendritic self - organization is a powerful mechanism that makes endocytic actin networks resil - ient to biochemical and mechanical perturbations . Spatial distribution of actin / coat attachments and Arp2 / 3 complex , but not Arp2 / 3 complex density , strongly affects actin self - organization and pit internalization Our finding that self - organized endocytic actin networks grow toward the base of the pit prompted us to explore the molecular mechanism by which actin filaments self - organize . Actin dynamics in association with the endocytic machinery can be thought of as a polymerization engine constrained by two spatial boundary conditions \u2013 active Arp2 / 3 complex at the base of the pit ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Kaplan et al . , in preparation ) and Hip1R / actin attachments on the curved pit surface ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Figure 4A ) . Given that such spatial boundary conditions confer unique mechanical properties and adaptation to loads under flat geometries in vitro ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) , we aimed to understand how the boundary conditions corresponding to the curved endocytic pit affect endocytic actin organization and internalization . We tested two different scenarios : varying the surface density of Arp2 / 3 complex at the base of the pit and varying Hip1R surface coverage around the pit itself . First , we tested whether the surface density of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the base of the pit affects endocytic internalization because recent studies in vitro and in yeast suggest that the local concen - tration of Arp2 / 3 complex activators is critical for the timing of Arp2 / 3 complex activation and endo - cytic progression ( Case et al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) . In a series of simulations , we distributed 200 molecules of active Arp2 / 3 complex in a ring of increasing outer diameter to vary the surface den - sity . Surprisingly , we found that varying the surface density of Arp2 / 3 complex along the base of the pit by a factor of 20 had little impact on endocytic outcome ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We also explored whether localization of a fraction of Arp2 / 3 complexes at the neck of the pit provided an additional advantage for the endocytic outcome . In this scenario , we distributed 50 of the 200 molecules of the active Arp2 / 3 complex near the neck of the pit . We found that localizing some of the active Arp2 / 3 complex near the neck of the pit did not have an impact on the outcome of simu - lations ( p > 0 . 5 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D \u2013 E ; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We next conducted a series of simulations in which we varied the surface distribution of a con - stant number of Hip1R molecules to cover between 1 % ( localized to the tip of the pit ) and 80 % ( up to the neck of the pit ) of the pit ( Figure 4B ) and found that the surface distribution of Hip1R around the endocytic pit strongly impacted endocytic outcome ( Figure 4 ) . Simulations in each of these con - ditions revealed that endocytic internalization depends on the surface distribution of actin - coat attachments around the endocytic site ( Figure 4C and Figure 4\u2014video 1 ) . Both the rate and extent of internalization increased with increasing surface area of Hip1R around the pit ( Figure 4D ) . From a functional standpoint , increased Hip1R surface coverage around the pit drove more barbed ends toward the base of the pit ( Figure 4E ) . This increase in Hip1R surface coverage resulted in an increase in Arp2 / 3 complexes bound in the endocytic actin network ( Figure 4F ) , which in turn nucle - ated more actin filaments ( Figure 4G ) . Simulations showed that a threshold of ~ 100 Hip1R molecules on the pit is necessary for endocytic internalization ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . The high impact of Hip1R surface distribution on actin filament organization implies that Hip1R molecules dis - tributed broadly around the pit allow for multivalent attachments between the pit and actin fila - ments , resulting in filaments being captured in an orientation conducive to force production . Further examination of the simulations revealed that the Hip1R surface distribution supports a self - organized dendritic actin network via a mechanism of stochastic self - assembly and selection for actin filaments growing toward the base of the pit ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . Mother fila - ments initially bind and unbind the coat in random orientations ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B \u2013 C ) . Filaments growing toward the interior of the cell do not template the growth of new branched Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 10 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems actin filaments . However , filaments growing toward the base of the pit encounter active Arp2 / 3 com - plex , which catalyzes dendritic nucleation of new actin filaments growing in a similar direction ( Fig - ure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B and D ; Carlsson , 2001 ) . As a result , near the base of the pit , filaments increasingly orient toward the base of the pit over time ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E \u2013 F ) . Our observations therefore establish an important principle for actin organization in endocytosis : the positions of active Arp2 / 3 complexes are critical for organizing the actin network and determin - ing the direction of force production , while the Hip1R linker distribution is critical for recruiting 40 - 40 - 20 0 20 40 A r p2 / 3 c o m p l e x H i p1 R Boundary 1 : Active Arp2 / 3 complex Boundary 2 : Hip1R attachments B C G A D E C F Time ( s ) N u m be r A r p2 / 3 bound Hip1R coverage ( % ) Hip1R coverage ( % ) Z ( n m ) X ( n m ) Y ( n m ) N u m be r f il a m en t s bound barbed end Hip1RActin 80604020101 11020406080 - 40 - 20 0 20 20 - 40 Z ( nm ) 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 40 40 0 0 - 40 - 40 0 5 10 15 100 50 0 95 % i n t e r na li z a t i on ( n m ) Time ( s ) 0 5 10 15 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 0 5 10 15 0 5 10 15 B a r bed end s nea r ba s e 200 150 100 50 0 200 150 100 50 0 20 10 0 1 % coverage 10 % coverage 20 % coverage 40 % coverage 60 % coverage 80 % coverage 1 % coverage 10 % coverage 20 % coverage 40 % coverage 60 % coverage 80 % coverage Hip1R coverage Figure 4 .

Bending of endocytic actin filaments contributes to endocytic robustness Given that self - organized actin filaments help to nucleate new actin filaments that grow toward the base of the pit , questions remained about how these filaments contribute to and sustain force pro - duction . Closer examination of the simulations revealed that long actin filaments bend between their attachment sites in the clathrin coat and the base of the pit as a result of assembly confined by the membrane at the base of the pit ( Figure 5A ) . We predict that these bent filaments provide a previ - ously unrecognized means of force production by endocytic actin filaments . To test the prediction that actin filaments bend at sites of mammalian endocytosis , we used cryo - electron tomography on intact vitrified mammalian ( SK - MEL - 2 ) cells . SK - MEL - 2 cells grown on electron - microscopy grids are thin at their periphery ( < 1 m m ) , which makes them suitable for electron tomography studies . Indeed , we found bent actin filaments present at sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , between the clathrin coat ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and the base of the pit ( Figure 5B and Figure 5\u2014video 1 ) , in extended \u2018U\u2019 - shaped clathrin - coated pits similar to the stage modeled in our simulations ( Figure 5C \u2013 D ) . What could be a functional consequence of such bent filaments ? We hypothesized that the bent actin filaments store elastic energy that promotes endocytic internalization . We first quantified the filament bending in simulations and found that many ( 13 \u00b1 3 % ) of the actin filaments bend further than can be accounted for by thermal fluctuations ( Boal and Boal , 2012 ; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ; Figure 5E and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Most ( 92 % ) of the bent filaments bent less than the minimum energy expected to sever the filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ; Sept and McCammon , 2001 ; Figure 5E ) . Importantly , the bent filaments stored elastic energy by collectively continuing to bend over time , storing up to ~ 750 pN ! nm of elastic energy \u2013 mostly in capped fila - ments ( Figure 5F ) . In the context of pit internalization , the amount of elastic energy stored was larger than the magnitude of work required to internalize endocytic pits ( Figure 5F and Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 2B ) . The elastic energy stored in bent filaments was ~ 1 % of the total energy required to polymerize the endocytic actin network ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C \u2013 D ) , with pit internalization constituting ~ 0 . 5 % of the total energy from actin filament assembly ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . The majority ( 62 \u00b1 20 % ) of filament bending energy came from filaments directly bound to Hip1R , and 78 \u00b1 25 % of the bending energy came from filaments with barbed ends > 5 nm from the coat surface ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2F \u2013 H ) . 17 \u00b1 16 % of bending energy came from filaments with barbed ends near the base of the pit ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2I ) . For fila - ments near the base of the pit , the bending energy was distributed radially such that filaments with barbed ends ~ 130 nm from the center of the pit contribute the most bending energy ( Figure 5\u2014 figure supplement 2J ) . Filament bending serves as an important functional consequence of the self - organization of actin filaments at endocytic sites ( Figure 4 ) . With high Hip1R surface coverage around the pit , filaments directed to grow toward the base of the pit bend , storing elastic energy ( Figure 5\u2014figure supple - ment 2K \u2013 L ) . This elastic energy can be harnessed gradually under thermal fluctuations to drive endocytic internalization through a ratchet mechanism ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . To test the hypothesis that energy stored in bent actin filaments can promote endocytic internali - zation , we conducted simulations in which the resistance from membrane tension was released at a late time point ( t = 10 s , internalization ~ 50 nm ) along with capping filament growth ( Figure 5G ) . This scenario allowed us to test how the stored energy in the bent filaments ( rather than force gener - ated by growing filaments ) can promote internalization in response to an abrupt decrease in tension . We found that once membrane tension decreases , pit internalization sharply increases ( Figure 5H and Figure 5\u2014video 2 ) and filament bending near the base of the pit gradually decreases by 50 % with wide variance ( Figure 5I ) . Thus , we found that in addition to generating force actively by fila - ment growth ( Figure 3 ) , the endocytic actin network stores potential energy in the form of bent fila - ments that can promote internalization even after filaments have stopped growing .

Our simulations , conducted by varying the nucleation rate of Arp2 / 3 complex , predicted that inhibiting Arp2 / 3 complex activity stalls endocytosis ( Figure 6A ) . Endocytosis was inhibited when Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation rates fell below the basal value of 1 filament per second ( Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ) , and was insensitive to increased rates of nucleation ( Figure 6B ) . We validated this relationship with experiments modulating Arp2 / 3 complex activity in cells . The small molecule inhibi - tor CK - 666 prevents the Arp2 / 3 complex from nucleating actin filaments ( Hetrick et al . , 2013 ; Figure 5 continued limit for bending energy expected to sever filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 14 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems Nolen et al . , 2009 ) . Treatment of SK - MEL - 2 cells with CK - 666 inhibited endocytic progression , as marked by the lifetimes of endogenously tagged AP2 - RFP or dynamin2 - GFP at endocytic sites , in a dose - dependent and time - dependent manner ( Figure 6C \u2013 D and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Adaptation of the endocytic actin network to changes in membrane tension Because we and others previously modeled that membrane tension plays an important role in mem - brane bending during the formation of an endocytic pit ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Rangamani et al . , 2014 ; Walani et al . , 2014 ) we next varied the value of membrane tension in simulations to under - stand the relationship between tension , actin filament bending , and actin assembly ( Figure 7A ) . In our simulations , endocytic progression attenuated in a tension - dependent manner ( Figure 7A \u2013 E ) , consistent with previous modeling ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) and experimental observations ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Ferguson et al . , 2017 ; Ferguson et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2017 ) . However , at higher membrane tensions , endocytosis persisted better than expected for a non - adapting network , suggesting the existence of an adaptive mechanism ( Figure 7E ) . Therefore , we sought to under - stand how endocytic actin networks adapt to increases in load . We found that under low tension ( 0 . 015 pN / nm ) , endocytic pits internalize strongly ( Figure 7B and E ) and few barbed ends encounter the base of the pit ( Figure 7F ) , with fewer Arp2 / 3 complexes recruited to the network ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and a correspondingly low filament bending energy ( Figure 7H ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 15 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems internalization slowed but was not abolished ( Figure 7E ) . For these pits , more barbed ends encoun - tered the base of the pit ( Figure 7F ) , binding more Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Figure 7\u2014figure supple - ment 1A ) to nucleate more actin filaments ( Figure 7G ) and increasing the total actin filament bending energy near the base of the pit ( Figure 7H ) . As a result , upon increasing membrane ten - sion , the overall endocytic energy efficiency increased ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Thus , the self - organization of the endocytic actin network allows it to adapt to elevated membrane tension by nucleating more filaments at the base of the pit . Arp2 / 3 complex activity and Hip1R / actin attachments are critical for allowing actin filaments to drive endocytic pit internalization and adapt to changing tension Having established that endocytic internalization depends on two spatially confined boundary condi - tions \u2013 Hip1R / actin attachments at the curved pit ( Figure 4 ) and active Arp2 / 3 complex activity at the base of the pit ( Figure 6 ) \u2013 we next investigated how these boundary conditions alter the endo - cytic response to membrane tension ( Figure 8A ) . We systematically varied membrane tension and Arp2 / 3 complex activity in our model to gener - ate a phase diagram of endocytic internalization as a function of membrane tension and Arp2 / 3 com - plex activity ( Figure 8B ) . This phase diagram shows that cells with high membrane tension are especially sensitive to changes in Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation rate ( Kaplan et al . , in preparation ) , whereas cells with low membrane tension carry out endocytosis even with low Arp2 / 3 complex activ - ity , consistent with experimental observations ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . We hypothesized that actin network self - organization arising from the broad Hip1R distribution around the pit ( Figure 4 ) and filament bending ( Figure 5 ) might allow for the endocytic actin net - work to change its organization and force - producing capacity under elevated loads ( Figure 7 ) . To test this hypothesis , we conducted simulations in which Hip1R coverage was varied for different val - ues of plasma membrane tension ( Figure 8A and Figure 7\u2014video 1 ) . We found that the endocytic actin network\u2019s ability to adapt to load ( Figure 7 ) depends on Hip1R coverage around the pit ( Figure 8D \u2013 F ) . As the coverage of Hip1R around the pit increased , actin\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in membrane tension also increased , as measured by the number of barbed ends near the base of the pit ( Figure 8D ) , the binding of active Arp2 / 3 complex at the base of the pit ( Figure 8E ) , subsequent nucleation of additional actin filaments ( Figure 8F ) , and bending of actin filaments near the base of the pit ( Figure 8G ) . We conclude that sufficient Hip1R coverage around the pit ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) allows endocytic actin filaments to orient in such a way that they can encounter more Arp2 / 3 complexes at the base of the pit to nucleate more actin fil - aments . This spatial organization allows the actin network to adapt to sustain force production under a range of opposing loads ( Figure 8H ) . Discussion Understanding the relationship between actin filament assembly , actin network organization , and force generation on the plasma membrane requires iterative feedback between experimental meas - urements and computational modeling . An ultimate goal of this study was to relate single actin fila - ment mechanics to force generation by the collective actin filament network in CME ( Lacayo et al . , 2007 ) . We integrated modeling and quantitative cellular measurements to show that a minimal actin network composed of actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein , with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements , is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension . Approxi - mately 200 Arp2 / 3 complexes constitutively assemble at sites of endocytosis in human induced plu - ripotent stem cells . Endocytic actin filaments self - organize into a radial dendritic array , in which filaments grow toward the base of the pit . These filaments bend and store elastic energy , which sup - ports internalization . The endocytic actin network adapts to changes in membrane tension by driving more filaments to the base of the pit and increasing filament bending , which supports a higher load and nucleates more actin filaments . Four lines of experimental evidence support our model ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Two pieces of evidence serve as model validation based on published data and two more are based on experiments conducted in this study . Previous experiments from our lab showed that knocking down Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 .

Consistent with these observations , our simulations showed that a threshold number of actin linkers such as Hip1R is nec - essary for endocytic internalization ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A and Figure 8\u2014figure supple - ment 1A \u2013 B ) . This threshold appears necessary to allow efficient filament capture by the coat and force transmission from the actin network to the coat .

We also showed in our model that capping rate is an important parameter for progression of CME ; our simulations show that increasing the capping rate of actin filaments inhibits CME , presumably because increasing cap - ping decreases the total amount of actin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C \u2013 D ) . In this study , our simulations predicted that actin filaments bend around endo - cytic pits . These bent filaments store elastic energy for subsequent force production much as a pole vaulter\u2019s pole bends and stores energy for delayed force production . Using cryo - electron tomogra - phy of intact cells , we observed bent actin filaments at sites of endocytosis in mammalian cells ( Fig - ure 5 and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E \u2013 F ) . Finally , we also predicted that inhibiting Arp2 / 3 complex activity below its basal nucleation rate of 1 filament per second inhibits endocytosis in silico and this prediction was validated in cells using pharmacological agents ( Figure 6C , D and Figure 8\u2014 figure supplement 1G \u2013 H ) . Without sufficient Arp2 / 3 complex , CME fails due to insufficient force production . Three main conclusions resulted from our study . First , we found that the spatial segregation of Arp2 / 3 complex activation and Hip1R linker proteins on the clathrin coat are important factors for effective force generation . Unlike actin organization at the leading edge of a migrating cell wherein only one boundary condition at the plasma membrane is sufficient to enable force - generation capac - ity to be inferred ( Abercrombie , 1980 ; Bieling et al . , 2016 ; Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet , 2002 ) , in CME two boundary conditions are required \u2013 one at the base of the pit for actin polymeri - zation against the plasma membrane and the second on the coat of the pit for attachment of the growing actin filaments so forces are transmitted to the pit to drive internalization . In our model , we used Hip1R as a surrogate for Hip1 , Hip1R , and Epsin1 / 2 / 3 , which cooperatively link actin filaments to the coat ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . We conclude that based on the relative positions of Arp2 / 3 complex activa - tors and actin filament linkers , the resultant self - organized actin network orients to produce force orthogonal to the base of the pit rather than producing a pinching force on the neck ( Collins et al . , 2011 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . Pinching forces are achieved by the spontaneous curvature of the rigid coat ( Alimohamadi et al . , 2018 ; Foret , 2014 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . Any constriction forces generated by actin polymerization at the neck would likely occur at a later stage of endocytosis than is the focus of our model , and the filaments would need to be nucleated by a spatially distinct set of Arp2 / 3 activating proteins around the neck , or by an interaction between other actin filaments and dynamin , but the mechanism for arranging and anchoring such a network has not been elucidated ( Ma and Berro , 2018 ) . Second , the effective anchoring of actin filaments to the surface of the pit depends on the distri - bution of linker proteins on the pit surface . Since these linker proteins are embedded within the cla - thrin coat ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) , their surface coverage is directly proportional to the coat coverage on the endocytic pit . This observation suggests that one possible function of a large coat is for the actin - linking proteins Hip1 , Hip1R and Epsin to cover enough surface area to provide leverage for internalization . The role of linker protein coverage in force generation also has implications for the flat - to - curved transition earlier in endocy - tosis , when the membrane either begins to bend from a flat pre - assembled coat or continually deforms while the coat assembles ( Avinoam et al . , 2015 ; Bucher et al . , 2018 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . In cases when the clathrin coat gradually increases in area during membrane deformation , our findings imply that actin polymerization may be ineffective until the coat reaches a threshold size ( Avinoam et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) , with membrane tension con - trolling a switch for the flat - to - curved transition ( Bucher et al . , 2018 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ) . Future work will investigate the relationship between coat topology and actin forces during the initiation of endocytosis . Third , we showed a significant fraction of endocytic actin filaments bend under force . We predict that the bent filaments , whose existence we confirmed by cryo - electron tomography of intact cells , contribute to successful endocytic internalization in at least two ways . First , they might contribute to the resilience of endocytosis by preventing backsliding of the pit . Second , we expect that they con - tribute to internalization by releasing stored elastic energy when they straighten out under thermal fluctuations , consistent with the elastic Brownian ratchet mechanism for actin - mediated force pro - duction ( De La Cruz and Gardel , 2015a ; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . Here , filament bending occurs to a greater extent and for a longer time than previously described for coherent flat surfaces like the Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 18 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems leading edge , possibly due to the curved geometry of endocytic pits . Fixing the filament orientation at one end increases bending energy ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ; Ferna\u00b4ndez et al . , 2006 ) , which is accomplished here by multivalent attachments from Hip1R . Previous studies overlooked the role of actin filament bending at endocytic sites because of the predicted short length of filaments based on population averages ( Berro et al . , 2010 ) and the possible loss of less densely branched filaments during the preparation process for platinum - replica electron microscopy ( detergent extraction or sonication - based unroofing ) ( Collins et al . , 2011 ) . The load response of branched actin networks in vitro can be reversible due to filament bending ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ) , or permanent from a change in filament architecture ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ; Parekh et al . , 2005 ) . In our simulations , some of the elastic energy from bent filaments is released as internalization increases , suggesting a revers - ible compression of the network to store elastic energy ( Figure 5 ) . However , a significant fraction of filament bending is retained after the spring is released , which suggests that load also changes the intrinsic structure of the network ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . Importantly , the results presented here demonstrate a mechanism of active adaptation by the endocytic actin network to changes in load ( Figure 7 ) . Different cell types , different locations in the same cell , and different stages of endocytosis at the same location can have different membrane tension values at different times ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . Under flat geometries , branched actin networks adapt to load ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ; Mueller et al . , 2017 ) . Here , the distribution of Hip1R linkers around the pit directs more filaments to grow toward the base of the pit ( Figure 4 ) , which nucleates more filaments autocatalytically and increases filament bending ( Figure 5 ) , thereby supporting greater internalization ( Figure 7 ) . It is now important to determine whether the principles of actin filament self - organization and load adaptation identified here also apply to endocytic actin in the higher force regime characteristic of fungi . An agent - based model of endocytic actin networks in yeast predicted that barbed filament ends radiate away from the center of pit in the XY plane ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . However , the > 200 x larger force requirements in this organism lead to a different axial organization of the filaments , less filament bending , and a distinct mechanism of force production sufficient to counteract high turgor pressure . Understanding the mechanical function and load adaptation in the \u2018soft\u2019 regime studied here is likely to apply to a variety of cellular membrane bending processes employing branched actin networks , including the assembly and maturation of endosomes , lysosomes , and autophagosomes ( Rottner et al . , 2017 ) . Finally , we acknowledge that our model represents a minimal core actin machinery necessary for endocytic internalization in mammalian cells . This feature of our study was necessary so the number of free parameters could be limited . Future models will add complexity to test roles for filament crosslinking , filament severing , and myosin - I motor activity , among other factors . It is anticipated that these additional features will increase our understanding of the force - generation capability and overall efficiency of the endocytic actin network .

In the continuum model , the bending of the membrane was explicitly mod - eled and the contributions of the actin cytoskeleton were simplified to an applied localized force , while the agent - based model simplified the membrane and explicitly modeled actin and associated binding proteins ( Scheme 1 ) . We iteratively ran simulations in each module . The results from each module improved the assumptions of the other , over successive rounds of simulation and comparison to experimental measurements . In particular , experiments focused our attention on the internalization of the U - shaped pit and its transition to omega shape for both the membrane and actin modules . Experi - ments and the actin module informed the location of actin forces for the membrane mechanics model . The membrane mechanics simulations in turn informed the initial pit shape and force / exten - sion relationship for the actin module . Thus , these two modules synergistically provided collective information about how actin organization and dynamics couple to the bending and internalization of the clathrin - coated pit . Membrane mechanics module Continuum mechanics modeling of the plasma membrane allows a quantitative understanding of the relationship between applied forces and the shape of the membrane ( Dere\u00b4nyi et al . , 2002 ; Rangamani et al . , 2013 ) . Bending the membrane requires energy , such that pulling a tether from a flat membrane requires increasing force until the membrane adopts a tubule shape ( Dere \u00b4 nyi et al . , 2002 ; Alimohamadi et al . , 2018 ) . Adding a region with spontaneous curvature ( corresponding to the endocytic coat ) can help lower this energy barrier against moderate membrane tension ( Rangamani et al . , 2013 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . Forces due to actin polymerization can also help overcome the energy barrier ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) , but the relationship between applied actin Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 20 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems forces and coated membrane shape has not been explored quantitatively . The following assump - tions guide our model of the coated plasma membrane : . Membrane curvature generated due to forces or protein - induced spontaneous curvature is much larger than the thickness of the bilayer . Based on this assumption , we model the lipid bilayer as a thin elastic shell with a bending energy given by the Helfrich - Canham energy , which is valid for radii of curvatures much larger than the thickness of the bilayer ( Helfrich , 1973 ) . . We neglect the surrounding fluid flow or inertial dynamics and assume that the membrane is at mechanical equilibrium at all times ( Naghdi , 1957 ; Steigmann et al . , 2003 ) . This assump - tion is commonly used in the modeling of membrane curvature to keep the mathematics trac - table ( Alimohamadi et al . , 2018 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Rangamani et al . , 2014 ; Steigmann et al . , 2003 ; Vasan et al . , 2018 ) . . The membrane is incompressible because the energetic cost of stretching the membrane is high ( Steigmann et al . , 2003 ; Steigmann , 1999 ) . This constraint is implemented using a Lagrange multiplier ( Alimohamadi et al . , 2018 ; Rangamani et al . , 2014 ; Rangamani et al . , 2013 ) . . Finally , for simplicity in the numerical simulations , we assume that the membrane in the region of interest is rotationally symmetric . The following derivation can also be found in Hassinger et al . ( 2017 ) . We use a modified form of the Helfrich energy defined as W \u00f0 H ; K ; ! a \u00de \u00bc k \u00f0 H \" C \u00f0 ! a \u00de\u00de 2 \u00fe ! k K A general force balance on the membrane can be written as ! ! s \u00fe p n \u00bc f ; where is ! ! surface divergence , s is the stress vector , p is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the volume bounded by the membrane , and f is any externally applied force per unit area on the membrane . The stress vector can be split into normal and tangential components as s a \u00bc T a \u00fe S a n ; where T a \u00bc T ab a b ; T ab \u00bc s ab \u00fe b b \" M \" a ; S a \u00bc \" M ab ; b : s ab and M ab can also be written as s ab \u00bc # q F \u00f0 # ; H ; K ; x a \u00de q a ab \u00fe q F \u00f0 # ; H ; K ; x a \u00de q a ba ! \" ; M ab \u00bc # 2 q F \u00f0 # ; H ; K ; x a \u00de q b ab \u00fe q F \u00f0 # ; H ; K ; x a \u00de q b ba ! \" ; Here \u00f0 a ab \u00de \u00bc \u00f0 a ab \u00de is the dual metric or first fundamental form , b ab is the second fundamental form and # is the surface mass density .

The parameters used for the spontaneous curvature simulations are specified in Supplementary file 1 : To perform the coat pulling simulations , we applied an axial force acting downward along the protein coat and upward along the base of the pit such that the net force integrates to 0 ( we do this by scaling the applied force by the area over which it is applied ) . This force function was defined as f \u00bc f 0 \u2019\u00f0 0 : 5 \u00f0\u00f0 1 \" tanh \u00f0 g \u2019\u00f0 a \" a 0 \u00de\u00de\u00de = a 0 \" \u00f0 tanh \u00f0 g \u2019\u00f0 a \" a in \u00de\u00de \" tanh \u00f0 g \u2019\u00f0 a \" a out \u00de\u00de\u00de = \u00f0 a out \" a in \u00de\u00de\u00de where a 0 is the non - dimensional coat area , a is the non \" dimensional membrane area , a out \" a in is the area of force applied at the base of the pit . a in corresponds to an inner radius r in and a out corre - sponds to an outer radius r out within which the upward force is applied . These parameters are specified in Supplementary file 2 . To simulate the pinched ( \u2018omega - shaped\u2019\u201d ) curves at high membrane tension , we provided an ini - tial guess of an \u2018omega - shaped\u2019 membrane from a lower membrane tension . We did this because the simulations stalled at U shapes at an internalization of about 100 nm . Providing this initial guess led to solutions for membrane shape and force beyond 100 nm , as seen in Figure 1C . Further , to fully explore the space of solutions , we ran the simulations backward by starting from an \u2018omega shaped\u2019 pit at a large internalization and then decreasing the internalization . In Figure 1C , we plot - ted the curves for negative internalization > = the farthest internalization for the U shaped pit ( generally ~ 100 nm ) . Values of membrane tension in Figure 1C are [ 0 : 051 : 0 . 05 : 0 . 451 ] pN / nm , and rounded to two significant digits in the figure for clarity . Actin module We used Cytosim ( Nedelec and Foethke , 2007 ) to model the polymerization of a branched actin network coupled to the internalization of a clathrin - coated pit . This approach simplified the pit as a bead attached to a flat boundary ( the plasma membrane ) by a spring . This assumption of a linear force - extension relationship was validated in Figure 1 . Actin filaments and actin - binding proteins ( Arp2 / 3 complex , Hip1R ) were explicitly simulated as individual objects ( agents ) . Cytosim calculates the forces on each segment of actin from rules such as diffusion , confinement , growth , and binding based on Brownian dynamics . Assumptions in Cytosim Cytosim simulates the movement of actin model points within a boundary according to constrained Langevin dynamics ( Nedelec and Foethke , 2007 ) , which accounts for the diffusion , bending , and forces of actin filaments , as well as the diffusion and binding of actin - binding proteins detailed below . 1 .

The endocytic pit a distance z from the cell surface experiences a force F \u00bc kz . ii . Actin filaments are confined inside the cell wherein each model point at distance z outside the cell experiences a force F \u00bc kz . 4 . Bending elasticity of filament model points : a . Filament model points are connected via linear elasticity according to a flexural rigidity k , which is the persistence length L p multiplied by k B T . b . The bending elasticity is treated as linear ( see Limitations ) such that for three connected actin model points m 0 ; m 1 ; m 2 the force for those points is F \u00bc k \u00f0 p = L \u00de 3 \u00f0 m 0 \" 2 m 1 \u00fe m 2 \u00de , where k is the flexural rigidity , p is the number of model points , and L is the length of the filament . 5 . Actin - binding proteins a . Hip1R binds actin filaments according to a binding rate and binding radius ( probability of binding when a filament is within the binding radius ) . This general actin - binding protein is a simplification of the multiple interacting proteins that link actin to the coat , including Hip1 and Epsin1 / 2 / 3 ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . b . Arp2 / 3 complex was developed as a special - case \u2018fork\u2019 class with two coupled ends . One end binds actin filaments , and the other nucleates a new actin filament , provided the first end bound an actin filament ( this is defined as trans - activation in Cytosim ) . In the \u2018fork\u2019 class , the two ends are constrained geometrically at a resting angle with a given resis - tance to torque ( angular stiffness ) similar to 4b above ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . Assumptions for modeling mammalian clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cytosim Geometry Endocytic pit : We used our membrane mechanics simulations ( Figure 1 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) to estimate the dimensions of the endocytic pit for physiological values of membrane tension and rigid - ity of the membrane and clathrin coat . Under these conditions the clathrin coat bends the plasma membrane into a U - shaped hemisphere ( Figure 1 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . We initialized the pit as a hemisphere 90 nm in diameter ( Avinoam et al . , 2015 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ) . As the pit internalizes , a smaller neck is exposed ( Figure 1 ) , which is modeled as a sphere with a cylindrical neck of diameter 60 nm . Internalization is defined as a displacement in the - Z direction ( Figure 1A ) . Active Arp2 / 3 complex : We collapsed the activation steps of Arp2 / 3 complex into a single spe - cies , active Arp2 / 3 complex , that resides on the plasma membrane from the beginning of the simula - tion . This models the cellular process , in which soluble Arp2 / 3 complex is inactive until it encounters its activator N - WASP at the plasma membrane . N - WASP binds the plasma membrane via a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - binding site ( which relieves its own autoinhi - bition ) ( Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . Additional proteins can bind different regions of N - WASP to increase its level of activation , including the GTPase Cdc42 , actin nucleator cortactin , and BAR protein SNX9 . Because the activation rate and concentrations of these proteins are not yet known , we considered fully active N - WASP ( similar to the VCA region alone ) rather than modeling the individual activation steps . Furthermore , rather than explicitly modeling N - WASP , we used pre - activated Arp2 / 3 com - plex , which models the coincidence of active N - WASP with soluble Arp2 / 3 complex on the plasma membrane . This active Arp2 / 3 complex can template new branched actin filaments when in proxim - ity of an existing \u2018mother\u2019 actin filament . Thus , this model aims to functionally capture Arp2 / 3 Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 24 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems complex activation and the geometry of branched actin filament nucleation , rather than explicitly modeling each molecule involved in the process of Arp2 / 3 complex activation . N - WASP ( or its homologues Las17 / WASP in yeast ) accumulates earlier in endocytosis ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) until a \u2018threshold\u2019 concentration triggers actin assembly ( Sun et al . , 2017 ) ; here we initialize all the active Arp2 / 3 complex on the plasma membrane at the beginning of the simula - tion , and it is used over the course of the simulation . Therefore we model the phase in which a threshold value of Arp2 / 3 complex activators has accumulated at the endocytic site and is ready to trigger actin polymerization . We assumed that activated Arp2 / 3 complex resides in a ring around the base of the endocytic pit . This feature has been shown for the budding yeast homologue of N - WASP , Las17 ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Endocytic actin polymerizes from the base of the pit in budding yeast ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) and in mammalian cells ( Kaplan et al . , in preparation ; Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ) , consistent with active Arp2 / 3 complex residing in a ring at the base of the pit . In our fluorescence micrographs , Arp2 / 3 complex is diffraction - limited , so the outer diameter of this ring is * 250 nm . The inner diameter of the ring of Arp2 / 3 complex corre - sponds to the width of the neck of the pit , 60 nm . In budding yeast the Las17 ring outer diameter is ~ 140 nm ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) , which corresponds to a surface density of ~ 3000 molecules / m m 2 . We conservatively set the outer radius of the ring to be 240 nm , which also corresponds to a surface density of ~ 3000 molecules / m m 2 . Estimates of the surface density of in vitro and in vivo patterned activators of Arp2 / 3 complex ( also called nucleation - promoting factors ) range from ~ 3000 \u2013 19000 molecules / m m 2 ( Bieling et al . , 2018 ; Case et al . , 2019 ; Ditlev et al . , 2012 ) . Filament attachments to endocytic pit In mammalian cells , Hip1R and Epsin connect actin filaments to the endocytic pit ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Both are present throughout the clathrin coat ( Clarke and Royle , 2018 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . We wrote a script in Matlab to uniformly distribute Hip1R molecules around a desired coverage of a sphere , from 1 % to 80 % of a sphere ( Figure 4 ) . In most simulations Hip1R was distributed in 60 % of a sphere . Modeling actin filament dynamics Stall force : Filament polymerization slows under applied load according to the Brownian Ratchet the - ory ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . This is treated in Cytosim as growth velocity that slows exponentially under applied load , which is reasonable within the time scales of endocytosis . Modeling filament capping Previous filament - based models of actin in endocytosis modeled actin filaments with uniform lengths or that grow until a maximum length ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) , while others took into account stochastic capping without diffusion or bending ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) . We adapted an existing property in Cyto - sim to model stochastic filament capping , such that the capping events were exponentially distrib - uted . We modeled actin filaments using Cytosim\u2019s \u2018classic\u2019 fiber class , which treats the filament as growing from its plus end , with a stochastic probability of depolymerizing ( corresponding to catas - trophe for microtubules ) . We set the depolymerization rate of shrinking filaments to be 0 with no recovery rate . Thus these filaments become irreversibly capped after an exponential wait time char - acterized by the parameter catastrophe _ rate ( which we define as the capping rate ) . Because the probability that capping protein binds to the barbed end of the filament is exponentially distributed , filament lengths are exponentially distributed ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . We set the rate of capping to achieve a desired mean filament length based on the expected distributions of actin fila - ment lengths for a given capping rate . In Cytosim , the catastrophe rate can be set to depend on a combination of applied load and growth velocity , which we did not include in our model of actin fila - ment capping . Source of actin mother filaments Active Arp2 / 3 complex requires a mother filament from which to nucleate a new actin filament at a defined angle ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , the polarity of the Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 25 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems mother filament defines the polarity of the resultant branched actin network . Our study uses diffus - ing linear actin filament nucleating proteins ( Balzer et al . , 2018 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ; Wagner et al . , 2013 ) to seed a defined number of randomly oriented mother filaments near the endocytic site . Alternatively , simulations using a pool of cytoplasmic linear actin filaments ( Raz - Ben Aroush et al . , 2017 ) allowed for similar internalization , but with less reliable timing of initiation . More detailed studies of the mechanism of actin nucleation and mother filament generation are necessary . Limitations Endocytic pit internalization is simplified as an elastic spring , with a linear relationship between force and extension . We show in Figure 1 that this linear relationship is characteristic of coated plasma membranes under force up until a threshold internalization of ~ 100 nm . Future studies will treat the coated membrane as a 3D , force - dependent curving surface ; such an approach is outside the scope of the present work . We focus our model on the minimal actin machinery required to produce force . We have not included crosslinkers ( Ma and Berro , 2018 ) or myosin I , both of which are expected to increase the network\u2019s ability to produce force . The effects of these two proteins on mammalian endocytosis will be treated in a future study . The treatment of filament bending elasticity as linear is valid for small deflections of individual actin model points . Importantly , the outcomes of our simulations did not depend on the frequency of segmentation of actin model points ( which change the magnitude of deflection between individ - ual actin model points ) . Filament twist or twist - bend coupling , which increases the total energy stored in bent actin filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ) , is not considered in Cytosim , and requires a more detailed modeling approach considering each subunit . Cytosim does not implement hydro - dynamics for curved filaments , so the diffusion of these filaments is approximated as the motion for a linear filament . Arp2 / 3 complex preferentially binds to the curved sides of actin filaments ( Risca et al . , 2012 ) . We do not include this assumption in our model . We expect that the self - organization and robustness exhibited by our minimal actin network would be enhanced by this assumption , given that Arp2 / 3 complex at the base of the pit encounters many curved sides of actin filaments . Parameter values We derived most parameters from experimental data in the literature , and made measurements for some measurements not available ( Supplementary file 3 ) . We varied the remaining parameters to show their effect on the outcome of the simulations . Discussion of each parameter follows below . Membrane tension We used the relationship between internalization resistance and membrane tension ( Figure 1 ) to cal - ibrate the spring stiffness in our agent - based simulations . We relied on values of membrane tension measured in human skin melanoma SK - MEL - 2 cells , based on atomic force microscope membrane tether rupture forces and the assumption that the rigidity of the plasma membrane is 320 pN ! nm ( Dimova , 2014 ; Diz - Mun\u02dcoz et al . , 2016 ; Kaplan et al . , in preparation ) . Association rate constants The biochemical association rate constant , k on , is given in units of m M \" 1 s \" 1 . In Cytosim , we input the association probability between actin and a binding protein as a binding _ rate , in units of s \" 1 . These two rates can be related by the following relationship : k on \u00bc binding rate \u2019 capture volume ; which is defined as p \u2019 capture radius 2 \u2019 filament length ( Francois Nedelec , personal communication ) . This gives an order - of - magnitude scaling relationship to convert between k on and binding rate , considering that cytosim does not treat explicit binding sites on the filament ( Francois Nedelec , personal communication ) . Arp2 / 3 complex Branching angle : Based on Blanchoin et al . ( 2000 ) we set the branching angle of Arp2 / 3 complex to be 77 \u00b1 13\u02da , as measured for bovine Arp2 / 3 complex . Acanthomeba Arp2 / 3 complex adopts closer Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 26 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems to a 70\u02da branching angle . In NIH3T3 cells preserved by cryo - fixation , branch angles in the lamellipo - dium are 77 \u00b1 8\u02da ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , Blanchoin et al . ( 2000 ) was the only in vitro study we are aware of that measured the variance of branching angles , which was converted to an angular stiffness ( 0 . 076 pN / rad 2 ) . Therefore we set the resting angle of Arp2 / 3 branches as 1 . 344 rad with an angular stiffness of 0 . 076 pN / rad 2 . Unbinding rate We used the k off measured by Beltzner and Pollard ( 2008 ) : 0 . 003s - 1 . Nucleation rate Based on the association rate constant between activated Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments of 0 . 00015 m M \" 1 s \" 1 ( Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ) , we set the binding _ rate of Arp2 / 3 to actin to be 7 s \" 1 , given a capture radius of 10 nm and filament length of 100 nm ( see relationship between these parameters above ) . We note that this calculation of binding rate depends inversely with the filament length ( and number of filaments ) which are not directly comparable in our simulations given that the filaments and Arp2 / 3 are generally not freely diffusing . Still , it was remarkable that our best estimate for binding rate gave reasonable nucleation kinetics , and served as a threshold for timely internaliza - tion of the endocytic pit , whereas previous deterministic models needed to increase the association rate constant by 300 - 600x for efficient nucleation ( Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ) . These ODE models did not have spatial considerations , so this suggests that the spatial and tempo - ral confinement of actin filaments and the high local concentration of active Arp2 / 3 complex in our simulations accounted for most of this difference . Thus the local geometry has a significant ( > 2 orders of magnitude ) effect on the effective nucleation rate . Actin Growth rate : In cells the cytoplasmic concentration of actin is 60 \u2013 100 m M ( Haugwitz et al . , 1994 ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . In mammalian cells , a subset of this actin is available as polymerizable actin , both due to monomer - sequestering proteins ( thymosin B4 ) and due to only a subset of monomers being ATP - bound . We conservatively set the concentration of available polymerizable actin to be 20 m M , which given the association rate constant of ATP - actin of 11 . 6 subunits / m M / s ( Pollard , 1986 ) corresponds to a polymerization rate of 500 nm ( 182 subunits ) per second . Capping rate : The mean length of filaments in mammalian endocytosis has not been measured . We relied on the estimates from Berro et al . ( 2010 ) ; Sirotkin et al . ( 2010 ) which showed that for fis - sion yeast filaments were an average of 150 nm in length . We set the capping rate to be 6 . 3 / s , which set the mean filament length at 150 nm . We varied the rate of capping in our simulations . Less actin capping resulted in greater internalization , due to more actin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , the resultant amount of actin is larger than the amount of actin measured in CME in other organisms ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . Stall force : The stall force scales with the load applied and the concentration of actin monomers available ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . At 4 m M actin the filaments\u2019 stall force was measured to be 1 \u2013 2 pN ( Footer et al . , 2007 ) . With 40 m M actin the filaments could theoretically stall at up to 9 pN force per filament ( Dmitrieff and Ne\u00b4de\u00b4lec , 2016 ) . For the ~ 20 m M actin that we assumed was available for polymerization , the stall force was ~ 5 pN . Surprisingly , the extent of internalization varied weakly with stall force ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting that actin used another mode of force generation than elongation directly against the membrane ( Figure 5 ) . Persistence length : We set the persistence length of actin filaments to be 10 m m , which corre - sponds to a flexural rigidity of 0 . 041 pN ! m m 2 ( McCullough et al . , 2008 ) . Previous modeling studies used a value of 20 m m , based on measurements of actin filaments labeled with phalloidin ( Gittes et al . , 1993 ) , which stiffens actin filaments ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ; Pfaendtner et al . , 2010 ) . Changing the persistence length of actin between 1 and 20 m m had a minor effect on pit internaliza - tion ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Hip1R In mammalian endocytosis , several proteins link actin filaments to the clathrin coat via phosphoinosi - tide - and clathrin - binding domains and actin - binding domains , including Hip1 , Hip1R , and Epsin Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 27 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Messa et al . , 2014 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Our general linker protein , named in the text as Hip1R , is a surrogate for all proteins that link actin to the coat . Endocytic actin - binding proteins Hip1 and Hip1R use a conserved domain to bind actin with sur - prisingly weak affinity . This domain , which is alternately named the THATCH ( Talin - Hip1 / R / Sla2p Actin - Tethering C - terminal Homology ) , Talin - family , or I / LWEQ domain , has been isolated and stud - ied by several groups . We fit the binding results of previous Hip1R binding experiments in our lab ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) to estimate a binding affinity between Hip1R and actin as ~ 400 nM , and the affinity between clathrin cages and Hip1R to be ~ 1 nM . Both sets of data were fit well by the quadratic binding curve ( Pollard , 2010 ) , \u00bd LR ) = \u00bd L ) \u00bc \u00f0\u00f0\u00bd R ) \u00fe\u00bd L ) \u00fe K d \u00de \" \u00f0\u00f0\u00bd R ) \u00fe\u00bd L ) \u00fe K d \u00de 2 \" 4 \u2019\u00bd R ) \u2019\u00bd L ) \u00de 1 = 2 = \u00f0 2 \u2019\u00bd L ) \u00de where \u00bd L ) is the concentration of actin or clathrin and \u00bd R ) is the concentration of Hip1R , with r 2 = 0 . 94 and 0 . 99 , respectively ( data not shown ) . Other studies measured a weaker affinity between Hip1R and actin : K d = 3 . 4 m M , or 2 . 5 m M for Hip1 ( Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . In the presence of the first helix of the five - helix bundle comprising the THATCH domain , actin affinity further decreases ( Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Epsin has two actin - binding domains with very weak ( K d > 10 m M ) or unknown affinity to actin ( Messa et al . , 2014 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . For our linker protein we used a combina - tion of rate constants such that k off / k on ~ K d of 400 nM . Compared with dilute reactions , in an endo - cytic geometry actin filaments grow near the coat , so the actin filaments bind Hip1R more frequently . As a result we found that a relatively low binding rate was sufficient for binding between actin and Hip1R in our simulations . We varied the off rate of Hip1R and found that that , surprisingly , the internalization was robust to Hip1R off rate between 0 . 001 and 10 s \" 1 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supple - ment 1 ) . With such weak affinity , + 100 linking molecules are required for robust endocytosis ( Figure 4 ) . The following considerations support the likelihood that a sufficient number of actin - linking proteins reside in the clathrin - coated pit . In yeast , endocytic sites accumulate ~ 100 \u2013 150 molecules of the Hip1R homologue End4p and 230 molecules of the actin - binding protein Pan1 ( with K d to actin = 2 . 9 m M ) . Estimation from platinum replica images of clathrin - coated pits in SK - MEL - 2 cells ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) suggest that clathrin cages have approximately 55 \u00b1 12 \u2018faces\u2019 ( pentagons and hexagons ) , or up to 90 faces in HeLa cells . If the cage accumulates one Hip1R dimer per face , this would lead to 110 \u2013 180 molecules of Hip1R , plus molecules of Hip1 , Epsin1 , Epsin2 , and Epsin3 . From a similar analysis , SK - MEL - 2 cells have ~ 66 \u00b1 12 vertices ( triskelia ) , which corresponds to ~ 200 \u00b1 40 clathrin heavy chains and ~ 200 \u00b1 40 light chains . Since Hip1R binds clathrin light chain , a 1 : 1 ratio of these proteins would again suggest ~ 200 Hip1R molecules in the clathrin coat . Addi - tionally , actin binding by these linker proteins is likely highly multivalent . Mammalian Epsin proteins hexamerize in vitro via their membrane - binding ENTH domains , and Hip1 and Hip1R can dimerize with each Epsin through its ANTH domain by sharing a Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P2 molecule ( Garcia - Alai et al . , 2018 ; Skruzny et al . , 2015 ) . Adding an additional layer of multivalency , Hip1R and Hip1 hetero - and homodimerize via coiled - coil domains and a C - terminal dimerization motif ( Brett et al . , 2006 ; Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Niu and Ybe , 2008 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , it is quite likely that a sufficient number of actin - linking proteins cover the coat . Simulation environment parameters The internalization of endocytic pits was not sensitive to other simulation parameters including the segmentation of actin ( 1 and 100 nm per model point ; 1 m m model points introduced additional vari - ability ) , confinement force for actin within the cell , and time step of the simulation ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The viscosity of the cytoplasm and the endocytic pit weakly affected extent of inter - nalization ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Modifications to source code We added a method \u2018confine _ first _ surface\u2019 in which only the first segment of the multi - point bead is under confinement , and that the bead does not undergo angular displacements . We added data reporting methods , including ( 1 ) reporting the Arp2 / 3 complex branch angle ( Francois Nedelec ) ; ( 2 ) reporting the Hip1R - attached filament ID numbers ; ( 3 ) visualizing the axial Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 .

Comparison to theory Our calculation of the elastic energy stored in bent actin filaments is derived from the theory of deforming elastic beams ( Boal ) . Specifically , the bending energy E is determined by \u00f0 k B TL p ! 2 \u00de = \u00f0 2 l \u00de , where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , L p is the filament persistence length ( 10 m m for actin ) , ! is the bending angle , and l the free filament length ( contour length of the filament between the attachment site and barbed end of the filament ) ( Boal , equations 3 . 15 and 3 . 21 ) . In Figure 5 we reference ( Sept and McCammon , 2001 ) and ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ) to esti - mate the bending energy associated with fragmentation of bare actin filaments . Based on the energy associated with removal of two longitudinal contacts and one lateral contact between mono - mers in an actin filament ( Sept and McCammon , 2001 ) , the elastic energy associated with fragment - ing an actin filament is 26 \u2013 28 k B T ( De La Cruz et al . , 2015b ) . The rate constants in De La Cruz and Gardel ( 2015a ) associated with the probability of severing are not considered in this study . Running simulations We wrote custom scripts in bash to run parallel simulations on a high - performance computing server . Analysis of simulations We wrote custom code in Python ( 3 . 7 ) with Jupyter Notebook ( Project Jupyter ) to read , analyze , and plot the simulations obtained from Cytosim . X , Y = 0 is defined as the center of the pit . Energy associated with polymerization was defined as 5 pN * 2 . 75 nm = 13 . 5 pN ! nm per binding event . This code is available at the following website : https : / / github . com / DrubinBarnes / Akamatsu _ CME _ manuscript ( Akamatsu , 2019 ; copy archived at https : / / github . com / elifesciences - publications / Aka - matsu _ CME _ manuscript ) . Internalization energy We used the relationship E \u00bc 1 = 2 kx 2 to estimate the expected internalization for a non - adapting machine . From the internalization for k = 0 . 01 pN / nm ( low tension ) , we calculated the expected internalization using the same energy for different values of k . Specifically , for a single value of load , we calculated the work output based on energy ( work output ) E \u00bc 1 = 2 kx 2 , where k is the load ( in pN / nm ) and x is the internalization ( in nm ) . For an adapting network , the work output changes with load . For a non - adapting network , it does not , so as load k increases , internalization x decreases . This relationship of x as a function of k for constant E is plotted as the dotted line in Figure 7E . Energy efficiency is defined as the energy ( of internalization or stored in bent filaments ) divided by the total polymerization energy . Radial orientation metric : We defined the radial orientation as the sum of the dot products of the direction of the barbed end with the unit vector in X and Y , such that \" 1 = barbed ends oriented toward the origin ( the center of the pit ) , 0 = oriented tangent to the pit , and + 1 = oriented away from the center of the pit . 95 % internalization is defined as the 95th percentile of internalization . We use the first 12 s of sim - ulations to allow for comparison with simulations that terminated after t = 12 s . For Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 , we compared 95 % internalization in two conditions using the Welch\u2019s t - test in Python ( 3 . 7 ) with scipy . stats . ttest _ ind ( equal _ var = False ) . Barbed ends near base / neck : We chose a distance of 7 . 5 nm as a metric for proximity to the membrane ( base or neck ) as this was the width of 1 \u2013 2 actin monomers and less than the radial dis - tance between the neck surface and the pit diameter . The absolute value of this metric did not change the results appreciably . Experimental method details Cell line maintenance WTC - 10 human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) were obtained from the lab of Bruce Conklin and genome edited using TALENs to endogenously express AP2 - tagRFP - T at one allele at an Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 .

We grew these cells on matrigel ( hESC - Qualified Matrix , Corning ) ( 80 m g / mL , 1 mL / well ) in StemFlex ( Thermo Fisher ) with Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher ) , and passaged with Gentle Cell Dissociation reagent ( EDTA - based clump passaging ; StemCell Technologies ) . Parental and genome - edited cells were tested for mycoplasma and authen - ticated by STR profiling . For single - cell applications ( genome editing , flow cytometry , transfections ) we trypsinized the cells with the recombinant trypsin TrypLE Select ( Thermo Fisher ) and grew the cells in StemFlex supplemented with the specific rho kinase inhibitor RevitaCell ( Thermo Fisher ) . SK - MEL - 2 cell culture SK - MEL - 2 cells endogenously expressing clathrin light chain CLTA - RFP and dynamin2 - eGFP ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) were cultured in DMEM / F12 ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( HyClone ) and Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher ) . A day before imaging , the cells were seeded on 25 mm diameter glass coverslips ( Fisher Scientific ) . Cell line construction We followed ( Dambournet et al . , 2014 ) to create lines human induced pluripotent ( hiPS ) cells with genetically encoded fluorescent fusion proteins . To the AP2 - RFP cells described above , we used the following Cas9 ribonuclear protein electroporation method for genome editing . Gibson assembly of DNA G - blocks ( IDT ) was used to construct a donor plasmid containing the tagGFP2 gene , codon optimized for mammalian cell expression , between 500 base pair homology arms flanking the 3\u2019 ter - minus of the ArpC3 gene . S . pyogenes NLS - Cas9 was purified in the University of California Berkeley QB3 MacroLab and frozen at \" 80 \u02daC until use . TracrRNA and crRNAs were purchased from IDT . Cells were trypsinized in TrypLE select ( Thermo Fisher ) , mixed with donor plasmid ( final concentra - tion 3 . 8 m M ) and 240 pmol Cas9 ( final concentration 1 . 75 m M ) complexed with 100 m M crRNA and tracrRNA ( final concentration 3 . 7 m M ) , and electroporated with an Amaxa nucleofector in stem cell nucleofector reagent ( Lonza ) . The sequence of the crRNA to target the C terminus of the ArpC3 gene was CCGGGCUCCCUUCACUGUCC . Cells were seeded on matrigel - coated 6 - well plates in StemFlex supplemented with the rho - kinase inhibitor RevitaCell and media was changed 24 hr later . Three days after electroporation the cells were bulk sorted for GFP fluorescence with a BD Biosci - ence Influx sorter ( BD Bioscience ) . Fluorescence intensities of cell populations were analyzed using the flow cytometry software FlowJo ( FlowJo , LLC ) . Around one week later the cells were re - sorted into matrigel - coated 96 - well plates at densities of 5 , 10 , or 20 cells per well . Positive clones were confirmed by PCR and sequencing of the genomic DNA locus . From genomic DNA and fluorescent cell sorting analysis we determined that both alleles of ArpC3 were tagged with tagGFP2 . We sequenced genomic DNA extracts from the cell lines at the insertion sites to confirm that there were no insertions or deletions at the site of GFP insertion . We isolated genomic DNA using the DNEasy blood and tissue DNA isolation kit ( Qiagen ) . The primers used for PCR amplification of genomic DNA were TCAGGGTGGCTTTCTCTCCT and CCAGAGCTGCAACCAGTACA . The primers used for sequencing the ArpC3 allele were ACTTATTCTTATTAAGCGCCAGC and CAGGGCTCTGGA - GACGGT . Western blotting We pelleted 1 \u2013 2 wells of cells from a 6 - well plate ( ~ 10 6 cells ) at 4 \u02daC and lysed the cells in 50 mM Hepes pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and cOmplete Mini EDTA - free prote - ase inhibitor ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Extracts were separated electrophoretically in sample buffer with 80 mM DTT on 8 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . Membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in PBS , probed with mouse monoclonal anti - GAPDH ( ProteinTech 10494 \u2013 1 - AP ) at 1 : 5000 dilution and rabbit polyclonal antibody against tag ( C , G , Y ) FP ( Evrogen AB121 Lot 12101231265 ) at 1 : 2500 dilution in PBS with 0 . 1 % TWEEN - 20 and 1 : 100 PBS / milk , followed by incubation in donkey anti - mouse CF680 and donkey anti - rabbit CF800 ( Li - Cor Bioscences ) . Washed membranes were imaged on a Li - Cor Odyssey Clx infrared fluorescence imager ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Choice of subunit to tag : We chose the location of the GFP tag based on available structural , biochemical , cell biological , and genetic data on the functionality of fluorescent fusion proteins of subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 30 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems ArpC3 ( p21 ; Arc18 in budding yeast ) tags are more functional than tags on Arp2 , Arp3 , or ArpC5 ( Arc15 in budding yeast ) ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Single - particle electron microscopy reconstructions and the crystal structure ( PDB : 2p9l ) of Arp2 / 3 complex show that the C terminus of ArpC3 is flexible and does not sterically interfere with Arp2 / 3 complex\u2019s binding site to actin filaments or its activators ( VCA ) . Constructs for intracellular fluorescence - based standard curve We adapted self - assembling protein nanocages of defined copy number ( Hsia et al . , 2016 ) to con - struct a fluorescence calibration standard in live mammalian cells . These trimeric proteins were engi - neered by Hsia et al . ( 2016 ) at protein - protein interfaces to self - assemble into a 60mer ( KPDG aldolase ) that can be tagged at the N or and C termini with GFP to yield an average of 60 or 120 copies of GFP . Alternatively a two - component 24mer ( alamin adenosyl transferase and 5 - carboxy - methyl - 2 - hydroxymuconate isomerase [ King et al . , 2014 ] ) can be tagged one or both components with GFP to yield an average 12 or 24 copies of GFP per structure ( Hsia et al . , 2016 ) . DNA con - structs codon - optimized for mammalian expression were synthesized ( IDT ) with alanine mutations at K129 ( KPDG aldolase ) and R72 ( 5 - carboxymethyl - 2 - hydroxymuconate isomerase ) to abolish enzy - matic activity . An E126L mutation in the transferase ( King et al . , 2014 ) is predicted to abolish its enzymatic activity . The synthetic construct included GS repeat linkers and tagGFP2 codon optimized for mammalian cell expression . We inducibly tethered the nanocages to the plasma membrane using an N - terminal myristolation and palmitoylation motif and the FKBP / FRB * dimerization system , where FRB * is a T2098L variant of FRB that binds a rapamcyin analog , AP21967 ( Clontech ) , and does not bind endogenous mTOR . These constructs bound weakly to the plasma membrane even in the absence of AP21967 , presumably due to multivalent weak affinity binding . We transiently expressed these plasmid constructs into hiPS ( or SK - MEL - 2 ) cells with Lipofectamine Stem ( Thermo Fisher ) . After 2 days we imaged the cells along with the genome edited cells using similar imaging settings . TIRF microscopy Cells were imaged on either an Olympus IX - 81 or Nikon Ti - 2 inverted microscope fitted with TIRF optics . The IX - 81 microscope used a 60 , 1 . 49 NA objective ( Olympus ) and an Orca Flash 4 . 0 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Cells were illuminated with solid - state lasers ( Melles Griot ) with simul - taneous acquisition by a DV - 2 image splitter ( MAG Biosystems ) . The microscope was maintained at 37 \u02daC with a WeatherStation chamber and temperature controller ( Precision Control ) and images were acquired using Metamorph software . The Nikon Ti2 microscope was equipped with a motor - ized stage ( Nikon ) , automated Z focus control , LU - N4 integrated four - wavelength solid state laser setup , TIRF illuminator ( Nikon ) , quad wavelength filter cube , NI - DAQ triggering acquisition ( National Instruments ) , an Orca Flash 4 . 0 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) , and triggerable filter wheel ( Finger Lakes Intstrumentation ) with 525 / 50 and 600 / 50 wavelength emission filters . Cells were seeded on autoclaved 25 mm # 1 . 5 round coverslips coated with 1 mL matrigel ( 80 m g / mL ) or recombinant Vitronectin - N diluted in PBS ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were maintained at 37 \u02daC with a stage top incuba - tor ( OKO Lab ) and images were acquired with Nikon Elements . CK - 666 experiments CK - 666 ( Sigma ) was reconstituted in DMSO and diluted in imaging media prior to treatment . Cells were treated prior to or during imaging . Cells were treated for 45 min prior to imaging unless other - wise indicated in the text . \u20180 m M\u2019 treatment corresponds to 0 . 1 % DMSO treatment . Confocal microscopy We imaged cells on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon Instruments ) fitted with a CSU - X spinning disk confocal head ( Yokogawa ) , four solid - state lasers ( Nikon ) , IXon X3 EMCCD camera ( Andor ) , and emission filter wheel ( Sutter Instruments ) . The imaging area was kept at 37 \u02daC with 5 % CO2 ( In Vivo Scientific , LCI ) . We used a 100 , 1 . 45 NA Plan Apo oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) . Images were acquired using Nikon Elements . We generally imaged 3 \u2013 7 z slices with 300 nm z spac - ing at 3 s time intervals . Cells were seeded on sterile 4 - chambered or 8 - chambered # 1 . 5H ( 0 . 170 \u00b1 0 . 005 mm ) cover glasses ( CellVis ) . We imaged the cells in media supplemented with HEPES and the antioxidant oxyrase ( OxyFluor ) with substrate lactate . For quantitative fluorescence Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 31 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems experiments we limited the cells\u2019 exposure to ambient light , brightfield light and 488 nm laser light prior to acquisition , and used the same laser power during acquisition to compare experiments ( gen - erally 10 % acousto - optic tunable filter ( AOTF ) power ) . For most experiments , we used DMEM / F12 without phenol red ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with the protein supplement used in StemFlex media ( Thermo Fisher ) , which gave similar fluorescence intensity results as cells imaged in StemFlex ( which has phenol red ) . Time - lapse imaging of nanocages We treated cells with a range of concentrations of AP21967 for > 45 min and then imaged them on a spinning disk confocal microscope at 0 . 3 s intervals for 1 min . Image correction We took images of dilute GFP or autofluorescent Luria Broth ( LB ) to correct for uneven illumination in the imaging plane . The exposure time and laser power both scaled linearly on our instrument ( Fig - ure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) which allowed us to adjust for dimmer or brighter signals by changing the exposure time . Cryo - electron tomography sample preparation Holey carbon grids ( Quantifoil R2 / 1 , 200 mesh , gold ) were glow discharged using a Pelco SC - 6 sput - ter coater and sterilized in 70 % ethanol in H 2 O . SK - MEL - 2 cells were plated in DMEM / F12 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( premium grade , VWR Seradigm Life Science ) and 1 % Penicillin / Streptomycin ( Gibco ) onto grids and incubated overnight at 37\u02daC and 5 % CO 2 in a cell cul - ture incubator . Samples were blotted and plunge frozen using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) after addition of 10 nm BSA Gold Tracer ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Cryo - electron tomography data recording and processing Tilt - series were recorded on a Titan Krios operated at 300 kV ( FEI ) equipped with a Quantum energy filter ( Gatan ) and a K2 direct electron detecting device ( Gatan ) at 2 . 97 A\u02da pixel size and a target defo - cus of \" 2 m m . SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) in low - dose mode was used for automated tilt series acquisition using a bidirectional tilt scheme covering a whole tilt range from + 60\u02da to \" 60\u02da with a base increment of 2\u02da and a total electron dose of 100e - / A\u02da 2 . Tomograms were generated in IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) using the gold beads as fiducials for tilt - series alignment . For Figure 5 , tomo - grams were reconstructed using the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ( SIRT ) recon - struction algorithm , then filtered using the Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion ( NAD ) filter in IMOD and binned by a factor of 2 . For Figure 5\u2014video 1 , we used the backprojection algorithm for tomogram reconstruction followed by a smoothing filter ( Clip smooth function in IMOD ) . The U - shaped pit shown is one of six sites of CME we have identified in our tomograms , all of which have bent actin filaments around the pit to varying degrees . The bent filaments are especially prominent in the tomogram shown because of the orientation of the pit with respect to the missing wedge effect . A detailed treatment of these tomograms will be the subject of a subsequent study . Data analysis Calibration curve : We used a combination of custom - written and publicly available image analysis software in Fiji ( 1 . 52i ) and Matlab ( r2017b ) to analyze the traces of fluorescence intensity per spot , for multiple Z slices and time points . To measure fluorescence intensity per spot of GFP - tagged nanocages , we wrote a toolset in Fiji to select and circular regions of interest eight pixels ( 1 . 1 m m ) in diameter , and used cross - correlation to center the regions around the intensity - based center of mass . We selected as background regions of concentric circles one pixel larger than the original region of interest . The toolset measured the fluorescence intensity per spot , which we subtracted by the area - corrected background intensity to yield fluorescence intensity per spot for the four con - structs . Some analysis functions were adapted from published software ( Akamatsu et al . , 2017 ; Epstein et al . , 2018 ; McCormick et al . , 2013 ) . We measured only spots that were contained within the slices imaged and were single stationary spots . For comparison of fluorescence to eGFP - MotB , we used smaller ( 6 - pixel ) ROIs . Akamatsu et al . eLife 2020 ; 9 : e49840 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 49840 32 of 40 Research article Cell Biology Physics of Living Systems We plotted background - subtracted fluorescence intensity per spot as a function of predicted copy number per structure to obtain a calibration curve relating fluorescence intensity per spot to numbers of molecules per structure . For the curve in Figure 3D , we combined data from three experiments with different imaging conditions by defining the average 60mer - GFP intensity per experiment as 1000 arbitrary units . Lines are linear fits through zero with r 2 calculated by linear least - squares fitting . Time - lapse fluorescence quantification : We made modifications to automated MATLAB - based tracking software ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) to track and analyze fluorescence - intensity time lapse data of genome - edited cells . The core tracking program ( based on the software package m - track ) automatically identifies fluorescent spots and connects them as tracks by minimizing the lin - ear assignment problem ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . We used stringent tracking parameters with gap size 0 and search radius 0 \u2013 2 . 3 pixels ( 248 nm ) . GFP and RFP tracks with high variability in the inten - sity / time profile were automatically rejected ( Ferguson et al . , 2017 ) as well as tracks * 3 s in dura - tion ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) and the remaining tracks were associated spatiotemporally according to a cost matrix ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . We used two track rejection schemes . In the first , users were presented with fluorescence montages and XY coordinates of the tracks to assess the fidelity of tracking for each event ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . In the second , tracks were automatically rejected based signal - to - noise ratio ( > 1 . 05 ) and proximity to neighboring tracks ( > 525 nm ) ( Hong et al . , 2015 ) . We checked that the manual and automatic track rejection schemes yielded similar results ( lifetime distributions and intensity versus time plots ) as well as to manual , kymograph - based quantification of lifetimes ( below ) . From the above workflow ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) we increased throughput by connecting all steps into an automated tracking pipeline requiring minimal user input . For SK - MEL - 2 cells expressing CLTA - RFP and DNM2 - GFP , we tracked regions that were not near the nucleus ( which has a concentration of Golgi - derived clathrin budding ) and that did not have large , bright , persistent structures containing invariant RFP and GFP signals ( \u2018plaques , \u2019 which are likely sites of adhesion ) . Alignment method : For Figure 2G , we aligned tracks based on the time point after the peak intensity in which 50 % of the fluorescence remained in the GFP channel . We normalized the fluores - cence intensity to compare movies from different imaging conditions . For Figure 2I , we aligned the tracks based on the maximum intensity . For Figure 6D , we aligned the tracks based on the disap - pearance of the RFP signal . This code is available at the following website : https : / / github . com / Dru - binBarnes / Akamatsu _ CME _ manuscript . Manual track analysis : We wrote a Fiji toolset that generated two - color kymographs from user - defined regions of interest , and then quantified the lifetime based on the lengths of the kymographs ( from user - defined regions on the kymographs ) . This manual analysis was used in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A and for verification of the automated tracking scheme . This code is available at the following website : https : / / github . com / DrubinBarnes / Akamatsu _ CME _ manuscript . Nanocage particle tracking : To track the membrane - tethered nanocages in 2D in cells we used TrackMate , a plugin available in Fiji that optimizes the Linear Assignment Problem ( LAP ) ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . We detected spots using an estimate of 0 . 5 m m and threshold of 15 , using a median filter and sub - pixel localization . We used the simple LAP tracker with a maximum linking and gap closing distance of 1 m m and two frames and a minimum track length of 4 frames . Calculating numbers of molecules per endocytic site : We calculated the fluorescence intensity of background - subtracted ArpC3 - GFP spots colocalized with AP2 - RFP spots from single time - point images using the same background correction approach described for the calibration curve . We used the slope of the calibration curve to convert fluorescence intensity to numbers of molecules of ArpC3 - GFP . Because the standard is inside cells , this standard controls for fluorescence environment and fluorescent protein folding and maturation . We used the resultant histogram of numbers of ArpC3 - GFP per spot and the time - lapse fluorescence intensity data in Figure 2G to create the graph in Figure 2I of numbers of molecules of ArpC3 - GFP over time .

Does a person become more or less creative when exploring a new \ufb01 eld ? Ex - ploring new \ufb01 elds exposes a person to new knowledge that might increase the novelty of inventive output ; at the same time , exploration means a lack of prior expertise and a learning challenge that might harm the value of that output . Using new combinations as a measure of novelty and citations as a measure of value , we demonstrate correlations between exploring new \ufb01 elds and increased novelty \u2014 but decreased value \u2014 in an inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects panel . The negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on value is muted when the novice collaborates with experts or uses the scienti \ufb01 c literature in the new \ufb01 eld . We \ufb01 nd consistent results using an unintended change in noncompete labor law as an exogenous in \ufb02 uence on exploring new \ufb01 elds . The research illustrates two opposite in \ufb02 uences of exploration on creative output and suggests how inventors can reduce the downside of entering a new \ufb01 eld .

Jack of all trades will never be rich , says the proverb . \u201d \u2014 Adam Smith , An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , Book IV , Chapter V , p . 563 . Creative search is uncertain , and the optimal strategy rarely reveals itself beforehand ( Radner and Rothschild 1975 ) . March ( 1991 ) characterized the problem as a choice between exploiting known and proximal opportunities versus exploring new and distant possibilities . The analogy aptly describes the risky search process of invention ( Audia and Goncalo 2007 ) . On the one hand , people should exploit and build upon their prior knowl - edge and expertise ( Smith 1776 , Jovanovic 1979 , Simon 1983 ) . On the other hand , people should explore new \ufb01 elds and learn new knowledge ( Campbell 1960 ; Kuhn 1970 ; Merton 1973 ) . Exploration that proves successful provides the basis for future exploitation and the chance to mine a rich vein of value ; however , with each creative search episode , the fundamental conundrum reappears . We study the trade - off between these competing models of creative search , drawing theoretically from March ( 1991 ) and proceeding empirically with more nuanced metrics of inventive output that distinguish novelty from value ( Amabile 2013 , Kaplan and Vakili 2014 ) . We argue that inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds are more likely to create novel inventions because of exposure to new knowledge and recombinant fertility ( Frensch and Sternberg 1989 ) but less likely to create valuable inventions because they lack prior knowledge and expertise in the new \ufb01 eld ( Simon 1983 ) . We also propose that collaboration with experts and reliance upon scienti \ufb01 c literature in the new \ufb01 eld can help novices to overcome the learning challenge of explor - ing new \ufb01 elds and the negative effect on value ( Fleming and Sorenson 2004 , Guimera et al . 2005 ) . To test our predictions , we use a variety of data and types of analysis . First , we select the full population of inventors with U . S . patents assigned to \ufb01 rms for 1975 \u2013 2002 and estimate inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects panel models . Using repeated patents of the same inventor 1 within the same \ufb01 rm , we illustrate how exploring new \ufb01 elds increases the novelty of the patent , measured by new combinations of subclasses ( Fleming et al . 2007 ) , but decreases the value of the patent , measured by forward citations ( Harhoff et al . 1999 , Hall et al . 2005 ) . Second , we use an unintended change in noncompete labor law ( the Michigan Anti - Trust Reform Act , hereafter MARA ) that exogenously increased the cost to work in the same \ufb01 eld of expertise at a different \ufb01 rm . Prior research has established that inventors who are subject to non - competes and move between \ufb01 rms are more likely to leave their technical \ufb01 eld of expertise and explore a new \ufb01 eld , arguably to avoid a potential lawsuit ( Marx 2011 ) . We replicate these results by combining differences in the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01 elds across states ( comparing inventors who move between \ufb01 rms within Michigan versus those who move between \ufb01 rms within states that continuously prohibit noncompetes ) with differences across cohorts induced by the timing of the law change ( pre - versus post - MARA ) . MARA had a strong and signi \ufb01 cant effect on exploring new \ufb01 elds , enabling an instrument in cross - sectional two - stage least squares models ( Du \ufb02 o 2001 ) . These results hold for a variety of coarsened exact matching cuts and alternative measures ( Iacus et al . 2009 , Iacus et al . 2011 ) . The empirical models indicate that inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds create more novel patents . This result supports arguments that stress the importance of exposure to diversity and fresh perspectives . Yet the models also indicate that inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds create less valuable patents . This result supports arguments that stress the importance of experience and the accretion of specialized human capital . Speaking to the managerial challenge of how inventors and \ufb01 rms may reduce the risk of exploring a new \ufb01 eld , our \ufb01 ndings suggest that collaboration with experts and reliance on published science in the new \ufb01 eld can re - duce the decline in value . Extending the implications of the model to the U . S . state level , we illustrate how state - level enforceability of noncompete agreements increases the average novelty but reduces the average value of regional invention . The work provides a better understanding of the con \ufb02 icting theories and prior \ufb01 ndings on the rela - tionship between individual expertise and creative output ( e . g . , Weisberg 1999 ) , suggests normative insights for technical professionals and their managers , and il - lustrates how noncompete labor law in \ufb02 uences re - gional innovation . Theory and Predictions Economists have long argued for the bene \ufb01 ts of spe - cialization in labor ( Smith 1776 ) , and these paradig - matic assumptions strongly in \ufb02 uence thinking about inventors and the process of invention . Because tech - nological invention is a cumulative and recombinant search process , people typically rely upon prior knowl - edge and expertise ( Rosenberg 1982 , Weitzman 1998 , Mokyr 2002 ) . To \ufb01 rst reach and then contribute to the state of the art in a \ufb01 eld , a person needs to accumulate knowledge about the existing prior art in the \ufb01 eld as well as \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c learning and problem - solving skills ( Cohen and Levinthal 1990 ) . A person \u2019 s \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c knowledge and skills are the foundation on which the creative thinking process builds novelty ( Simon 1983 , Simon 1996 ) . Case studies highlight the importance of deep immersion in a \ufb01 eld of expertise prior to signi \ufb01 cant invention ( Weisberg 1999 ) . These assumptions suggest that scientists and engineers who explore a new \ufb01 eld should create less valuable inventions . Novices lack deep knowledge and skills in the new \ufb01 eld and need time to reach the frontier of knowledge ( Chase and Simon 1973 , Jones 2009 ) . Other scholars , mainly those who draw analogies to natural evolution ( Darwin 1869 ) , stress the importance of exploring new \ufb01 elds for inventive output . John Vaught , inventor of the HP inkjet printer , described it thus : \u201c HP [ Hewlett Packard ] Labs was a wonderful place : I had to work in a single \ufb01 eld for only two or three years and then like magic it was a whole new \ufb01 eld : a paradise of creativity \u201d ( Fleming 2002 , p . 1065 ) . Exposure to social , cognitive , and physical diversity provides the raw material for recombinant novelty and helps to break a person \u2019 s overly constrained and stale perspectives ( Campbell 1960 , Simonton 1999 ) . From a purely combinatorial perspective , and completely ignoring any other in \ufb02 uences on the \ufb01 rst evolutionary stage of variation , a greater diversity in knowledge mechanically affords more possibilities . Beyond the increased but purely combinatorial possibilities , many have argued that exposure to new \ufb01 elds makes people more creative . Although prior learning and existing paradigms in a \ufb01 eld help a person to interpret infor - mation and guide creative search , they may also cause myopia and constrain search ( Allen and Marquis 1964 , Ward 1995 ) . Scholars have labeled this cognitive process that causes extant expertise to block novel insights as in \ufb02 exibility of the information processing system , neg - ative transfer , Einstellung , or mental block ( e . g . , Luchins and Luchins 1959 , Frensch and Sternberg 1989 ) . These perspectives imply that creative professionals should move between different \ufb01 elds of expertise and become generalists rather than specialists ( e . g . , Frensch and Sternberg 1989 ) . By exploring new \ufb01 elds , they are freed from conventions and dogmas of a particular \ufb01 eld , catalyzed to adopt fresh perspectives and heuristics , and prompted to approach problems with a helpful level of na\u00a8 \u0131 vet\u00e9 ( Merton 1973 ) . Inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds should create more novel inventions . Extensions of both perspectives resonate throughout the literature on science and technology . Gil \ufb01 llan ( 1935 ) Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 2 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS and Kuhn ( 1970 ) argue that revolutionary discoveries are most likely made by people who are either very young or new to the \ufb01 eld . Novices are unbound by conventions and dominant paradigms in the \ufb01 eld and are , hence , more likely to adopt new and unconven - tional perspectives and heuristics to solve a particular problem ( Ben - David 1960 ; Merton 1973 ; Gieryn and Hirsh 1983 ) . Established cognitive maps , frames , and technological paradigms embody clear prescriptions of which search trajectory will be more productive ( Dosi 1982 , Kaplan and Tripsas 2008 ) . They become institu - tionalized into a \ufb01 eld so that specialists continue to work in the same direction . People with \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c expertise are thought to be more reluctant to break with con - vention and depart from prior art even while novel or \u201c revolutionary \u201d ideas and inventions are thought to originate from breaking with the familiar trajectory and convention ( Kuhn 1970 , Arts and Veugelers 2015 , Chai 2017 ) . Audia and Goncalo ( 2007 ) illustrate that more experienced inventors favor the exploitation of famil - iar knowledge at the expense of the exploration of new knowledge . Conti et al . ( 2014 ) show that more experienced inventors \u2014 with a larger stock of prior patents \u2014 produce more patents but patents that are less likely to be breakthroughs . Jeppesen and Lakhani ( 2010 ) illustrate that winning solutions to problem - solving contests are more likely provided by individ - uals with technical expertise that is \u201c distant \u201d from the problem \ufb01 eld . Azoulay et al . ( 2015 ) offer causal evidence that the death of a major scientist in a \ufb01 eld occasions entry by novices and that this entry renews the \ufb01 eld . We agree with both perspectives and offer a simple model to clarify the trade - off . Support for the model comes from measures of invention that distinguish novelty from value . We conceptualize invention as a recombinant search process ( Gil \ufb01 llan 1935 ; Schumpeter 1939 ; Weitzman 1998 ) , novelty as a new combination of ideas or components ( Fleming et al . 2007 , Uzzi et al . 2013 ) , and value as the future use or success of the invention . Amabile ( 2013 ) stipulates that creativity and invention , by de \ufb01 nition , require novelty and value . We agree these variables are crucial ; how - ever , we do not simultaneously require both and allow them to vary within an invention . By our de \ufb01 nition , an invention can be novel but not very valuable , valuable but not very novel , or varying degrees of both ( e . g . , Kaplan and Vakili 2014 , Conti et al . 2014 ) . This de \ufb01 - nition avoids the normative and popular connotation that all inventions are intrinsically novel and valuable despite the empirical reality that most inventions are incremental improvements of formerly used combi - nations and / or have little value . Although our evi - dence comes from patent data and our prose usually refers to inventors , these arguments should hold for other creative professionals , such as scientists or designers . Our simple model is that inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds are exposed to new knowledge , perspectives , and approaches ( Merton 1973 ) . They will see new com - ponents and new ways to arrange new and old com - ponents ( Fleming 2001 , Audia and Goncalo 2007 ) . This exposure increases the likelihood that the inventor will create new combinations for a variety of reasons , in - cluding simple combinatorial opportunities , psycho - logical refreshment , unblocking , and rearrangement of extant knowledge structures ( Campbell 1960 , Simonton 1999 , Carnabuci and Bruggeman 2009 ) . Working in a new \ufb01 eld will encourage the inventor to question the inventor \u2019 s assumptions , abstractions , creative goals , ap - proaches , target customer or user , success metrics , and prior procedures and solutions . As a result , inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds should create more novel inventions . Hypothesis 1 . Inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds create more novel inventions on average . Inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds lack prior \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c knowledge and expertise and , thus , face a dif \ufb01 cult and time - consuming learning challenge ( Hayes 1989 , Groysberg and Lee 2009 , Jones 2009 ) . Exploration causes mistakes , errors , and delay while the inventor climbs the learning curve in the new \ufb01 eld and connects fresh ideas to the inventor \u2019 s extant reservoir of experience ( Weisberg 1999 , Rosenkopf and Almeida 2003 ) . It de - mands \ufb02 exibility and the rearrangement and recod - ing of prior knowledge ( Frensch and Sternberg 1989 ) , and these efforts increase the rate and number of failed ideas . As a result , the likelihood of a successful \u2014 and valuable \u2014 invention decreases . Hypothesis 2 . Inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds create less valuable inventions on average . March \u2019 s ( 1991 ) original theory offered less insight to help the inventor avoid the downside of exploring new \ufb01 elds , the decline in the value of invention , while pre - serving the upside , the increase in novelty . Prior work suggests collaboration and published science might help scientists and engineers to deal with the learning chal - lenge of exploring a new \ufb01 eld ( Sorenson and Fleming 2004 , Wuchty et al . 2007 ) . Inventors who explore a new \ufb01 eld but collaborate with experts in this new \ufb01 eld could create more valuable inventions compared with novices who do not because collaboration can ease the \u201c burden of knowledge \u201d and make learning a new \ufb01 eld less dif \ufb01 cult and inef \ufb01 cient ( Guimera et al . 2005 , Jones 2009 ) . Rather than me - thodically working through a great deal of new material from scratch to \ufb01 nd what is useful and pertinent in a new \ufb01 eld or stumbling on their own , a collaborating novice can simply ask the novice \u2019 s knowledgeable colleague ( Kehoe and Tzabbar 2015 , Tzabbar et al . 2015 ) . A collaborator with depth in the new \ufb01 eld can guide the novice and winnow the novice \u2019 s worst ideas while Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS 3 keeping the best ( Singh and Fleming 2010 ) . To draw an evolutionary analogy , expert collaborators can take advantage of their newcomer \u2019 s creativity in the variation stage , but they can also \ufb01 lter the ideas that they recognize as previously tried and failed and unlikely to succeed in the selection stage ( Gieryn and Hirsh 1983 ) . This mechanism relies on more effective and ef \ufb01 cient teaching , learning , and communication and does not rely on moving extant collaborative capital ( commonly known as \u201c lift - outs , \u201d see Wezel et al . 2006 , Groysberg and Lee 2009 ) . Collaboration with \ufb01 eld experts should be particularly helpful for novices who lack prior knowledge and expertise in a \ufb01 eld and , as such , face a tough learning challenge . Thus , the negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the value of invention should be less pronounced if the novice collaborates with experts in the new \ufb01 eld . Hypothesis 3 . The negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the value of invention is on average weaker for inventors who collaborate with experts in the new \ufb01 eld . We expect similar bene \ufb01 ts for inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds and draw upon published science because scienti \ufb01 c theories reduce the degree of redundant effort and , thus , enable more ef \ufb01 cient search ( Nelson 1982 ) . Scienti \ufb01 c publication accelerates the diffusion of knowl - edge and lessens the need for learning from trial and error ( Sorenson and Fleming 2004 ) . Theory can suggest cau - sality and help an inventor predict how a new combi - nation might function . Awareness of published science facilitates prediction and decreases the need for empiri - cal iteration , experimentation , and learning ( Roach and Cohen 2013 ) . Science can illuminate dead ends before they are explored empirically through models that can predict a lack of performance or publication of previous results that show an approach has already been tried unsuccessfully ( Fleming and Sorenson 2004 ) . Because scienti \ufb01 c literature provides a map for inventive search , it could be particularly helpful for novices who lack prior knowledge and expertise in a \ufb01 eld , reducing the negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the value of invention . Hypothesis 4 . The negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the value of invention is on average weaker for inventors who rely on published science in the new \ufb01 eld . Methods Research Design and Data To study how exploring new \ufb01 elds affects subsequent output of an inventor , we use the U . S . patent database for several reasons . First , patent data are publically available and provide a detailed insight into the output of a large sample of inventors across different \ufb01 elds . The database allows us to construct complete patenting careers ( Li et al . 2014 , Balsmeier et al . 2017 ) . Second , given that the U . S . Patent and Trademark Of \ufb01 ce assigns patents into technology classes , the data allow us to identify whether an inventor explores new \ufb01 elds for each new patent the inventor invents ( see Jones 2009 ; as we rely upon observing the same inventor across subsequent patents , our subjects need to patent at least twice ) . 1 Given a new \ufb01 eld observed in a subsequent patent by the same inventor , we assess whether that subsequent patent is more or less novel and more or less valuable . Finally , a patent lists an assignee that is typically the employer of the inventor . To identify different corporate employers , we made use of the National Bureau of Economic Research assignee da - tabase containing harmonized names matched to \ufb01 rm identi \ufb01 ers for Compustat \ufb01 rms . This enables control for organizational characteristics that in \ufb02 uence an in - ventor \u2019 s output and identifying when an inventor moved between \ufb01 rms ( Marx et al . 2009 ) . We use two different samples and research designs to test our predictions . First , we begin with the full population of inventors and collect all patents assigned to \ufb01 rms but , by design , must restrict the sample to inventors who have at least two patents assigned to the same \ufb01 rm . The advantage of this panel setup is that we can use inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effect models to control for unobserved heterogeneity among inventors and \ufb01 rms , which arguably have a strong effect on the novelty and value of creative output . This approach basically uses repeated patents of the same inventor within the same \ufb01 rm to identify whether the inventor creates more or less novel \u2014 and more or less valuable \u2014 patents when any subsequent patent is categorized in a new \ufb01 eld . The sample includes 2 , 705 , 431 patent \u2013 inventor observations assigned to 396 , 336 unique inventors and 46 , 880 unique \ufb01 rms , accounting for 473 , 419 unique inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm pairs . We complement the inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effect models with a natural experiment , based on MARA , which ex - ogenously increased the cost to work in the same \ufb01 eld of expertise at a new employer , thereby nudging mobile inventors in Michigan after 1985 to explore new \ufb01 elds . The advantage of the natural experiment is in strength - ening causal inference ; the disadvantage is in failing to control for unobserved heterogeneity among inventors and \ufb01 rms . Moreover , the natural experiment only af - fected a subset of inventors , that is , inventors moving between \ufb01 rms in Michigan after 1985 , which might be different from non - Michigan or nonmobile inventors and , therefore , not representative of the full population . The natural experiment might also affect the selection of treatment subjects in case different inventors and \ufb01 rms responded differently to the labor law reform . In ro - bustness analyses , we \ufb01 nd no signi \ufb01 cant differences between any of the subpopulations and carefully match inventors affected by the labor law change to those not affected . Consistent results across these complemen - tary research designs strengthen our con \ufb01 dence in the Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 4 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS underlying model of exploring new \ufb01 elds and creative output . Measures Outcome Variables . To assess patent value , we cal - culate forward citations ( ln ) as the logarithmic trans - formation of one plus the number of times a patent is referenced as prior art within 10 years . Forward cita - tions are positively correlated with the private eco - nomic value of a patent , maintenance fee payments , and with the market value of the assigned company ( Harhoff et al . 1999 , Hall et al . 2005 ) . To assess patent novelty , we calculate new combi - nations ( ln ) as the logarithmic transformation of one plus the number of pairwise subclass combinations of a patent that appear for the \ufb01 rst time in the U . S . patent database ( Fleming et al . 2007 , Jung and Jeongsik 2016 ) . To do so , each pairwise combination of subclasses is compared with all pairwise combinations of all prior U . S . patents . Independent Variables . All independent variables are calculated at the inventor \u2013 patent level ( e . g . , Marx et al . 2009 ) . In case a patent lists multiple inventors , there will be multiple inventor \u2013 patent observations associ - ated with the same patent . 2 For each inventor \u2013 patent observation , one inventor is treated as the focal in - ventor , and the other inventors listed on the patent are treated as coinventors . For each inventor \u2013 patent observation , we retrieve the three - digit technology classes of all prior patents of the focal inventor and identify whether there is any overlap between the three - digit technology classes of the focal patent and the three - digit technology classes linked to all prior patents of the same inventor . We rely on all classes assigned to a patent rather than just the primary class . Exploring new \ufb01 elds is a binary indicator that equals one in the absence of any overlapping class between all prior patents and the focal patent . For each inventor \u2013 patent observation , we identify whether there is any overlap between the three - digit technology classes of the focal patent and the three - digit technology classes linked to all prior patents of the coinventors on the patent ( excluding the focal in - ventor ) . Expert team is a binary indicator that equals one if at least one of the coinventors has a prior patent in the same class ( es ) as the focal patent . The measure is used a moderator to test whether collaboration with experts reduces the negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on value . Science is a binary indicator that equals one if the focal patent cites nonpatent prior art , which are typi - cally scienti \ufb01 c publications ( Fleming and Sorenson 2004 , Ahmadpoor and Jones 2017 ) . 3 We rely on a su - pervised machine - learning approach to identify cita - tions to scienti \ufb01 c publications ( Callaert et al . 2011 ) . Such citations indicate an awareness of the inventor on the cited articles ( Roach and Cohen 2013 ) . Science is used a moderator to test whether reliance on scienti \ufb01 c publications reduces the negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on value . Control Variables . For each inventor \u2013 patent observa - tion , we calculate prior patents ( ln ) 4 as the number of prior patents of the focal inventor , specialization as a Her \ufb01 ndahl concentration index based on the three - digit technology classes of all prior patents of the fo - cal inventor , prior collaborations ( ln ) as the number of unique coinventors linked to all prior patents of the focal inventor , a binary indicator move that is equal to one for the \ufb01 rst patent of the focal inventor with a new \ufb01 rm as assignee , and a binary indicator for whether the focal inventor previously moved between employers ( prior move ) . In line with prior research , an inventor is assumed to move in case different assignees appear on two successive patents of the same inventor . Inventors with a larger stock of prior patents , inventors who are generalists rather than specialists , and inventors who formerly collaborated with a larger number of co - inventors or who moved between employers might create more or less novel and more or less valuable patents and might be more or less inclined to explore new \ufb01 elds . To control for the fact that inventors in the beginning or near the end of their career might be more or less likely to explore new \ufb01 elds , we include days since \ufb01 rst patent ( ln ) as the number of days since the \ufb01 rst patent of the inventor was \ufb01 led . To control for the fact that an inventor who more recently patented in a \ufb01 eld might be more or less likely to explore new \ufb01 elds , we include days since last patent ( ln ) as the number of days since the previous patent of the inventor was \ufb01 led . For each inventor \u2013 patent observation , we include additional controls for the characteristics of the co - inventors on the team . Team is a binary indicator equal to one in case the patent lists more than one inventor , that is , there is at least one coinventor . Team prior patents ( ln ) is calculated as the average number of prior patents of the coinventors ( excluding the focal inventor ) . Team spe - cialization is the average specialization of the coinventors ( excluding the focal inventor ) using a Her \ufb01 ndahl con - centration index based on the three - digit technology classes of all prior patents of the coinventors . To control for \ufb01 rm size , we include \ufb01 rm prior patents ( ln ) as the number of patents assigned to the \ufb01 rm listed as assignee . Finally , we include number of classes ( ln ) as the patent \u2019 s number of three - digit technology classes and number of subclasses ( ln ) . Three - digit technology class and year indicators control for secular trends in \ufb01 elds . 5 Because of the skew of count variables , we use their logarithmic transformation after adding one for vari - ables with zero values ( results are robust with nonlinear models ) . Table 1 presents a description and summary Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS 5 statistics for the full sample of inventors with at least one prior patent and at least two patents assigned to the same \ufb01 rm for observation period 1975 \u2013 2002 . Results Inventor \u2013 Firm Fixed Effects Model Results Table 2 illustrates the inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects models with and without interaction terms . We propose that in - ventors who explore a new \ufb01 eld will gain exposure to new knowledge and perspectives and increase the combinatorial opportunities , such that the average novelty of their output will increase . Without in - teraction terms , Model 1 illustrates that exploring new \ufb01 elds signi \ufb01 cantly increases the number of new com - binations by 6 . 7 % . 6 We also proposed that inventors who explore a new \ufb01 eld will lack \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c knowledge and skills , such that the value of their output will decrease . Also , without interaction terms , Model 6 illustrates that exploring new \ufb01 elds signi \ufb01 - cantly decreases the number of forward citations by 1 . 0 % . The preferred models include interaction terms . Considering the value models \ufb01 rst , hypothesis 3 pro - posed that the learning challenge of exploring a new \ufb01 eld can be eased by collaborating with people with expertise in the new \ufb01 eld . As illustrated in Model 8 , the predicted \ufb01 rst - order effect of an expert team is positive , increasing forward citations by 4 . 3 % . The predicted \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds also strengthens , indicating a reduction in forward citations of 3 . 0 % . The interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and expert team has the predicted positive effect and increases the number of forward citations by 8 . 3 % . Thus , the decrease in value from exploring new \ufb01 elds can be more than fully recovered by collaborating with knowledgeable inventors in the new \ufb01 eld . Collabora - tors with depth in the new \ufb01 eld may be able to direct the novice and winnow the novice \u2019 s worst ideas while keeping the best . Consistent with theoretical argu - ments , the interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and a nonexpert team is positive and signi \ufb01 cant al - though smaller compared with the interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and an expert team ( result not shown ) . These \ufb01 ndings illustrate that lone inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds on their own face a heavy burden of knowledge and suffer most from a decline in the value of their inventive output , relative to their collaborative peers . Hypothesis 4 proposes that drawing upon published science should similarly reduce the decline in value associated with the exploration of new \ufb01 elds . The predicted \ufb01 rst - order effect of science indicates an in - crease in citations of 7 % ( Model 9 ) . The predicted \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds strengthens , reducing forward citations by 2 . 5 % . The interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and science has the predicted positive effect on value , however , increasing the number of forward citations by 6 . 0 % and overcoming the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds . Hence , scienti \ufb01 c literature appears to be helpful for novices who lack prior knowledge and expertise in a \ufb01 eld . As illustrated in Model 10 , expert team and science together help to fully overcome the challenge of exploring a new \ufb01 eld . The total effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on value , accounting for both \ufb01 rst - order and interaction effects , is positive and signi \ufb01 cant , increas - ing forward citations by 9 . 3 % . We did not offer hypotheses on whether collabora - tion with experts and science moderate the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the novelty of invention . Collaborating in a new \ufb01 eld could make an inventor \u2019 s output more novel if the inventor \u2019 s collaborators em - braced the inventor \u2019 s new combinations , or it could make it less novel if they channeled the newcomer \u2019 s ideas into their prior trajectories . Drawing upon science when exploring a new \ufb01 eld could arguably increase novelty if it suggested new combinations ( and the in - ventor was not already cognitively overloaded ) . It could also decrease novelty if it suggested a path to success that required less recombinant iteration ( Fleming and Sorenson 2004 ) . 7 We nonetheless estimate the interaction effects to better understand potential trade - offs related to relying on expert collaborators and scienti \ufb01 c literature while exploring a new \ufb01 eld . The \ufb01 rst - order effect of having collaborators with expertise in the \ufb01 eld is negative and signi \ufb01 cant , de - creasing new combinations by 3 . 9 % ( Model 3 ) . This \ufb01 nding is consistent with Hypothesis 1 . The interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and an expert team is positive and signi \ufb01 cant , however , increasing new combinations by 2 . 4 % . Hence , the interaction partially ameliorates the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of expert team on the novelty of invention . Although collabo - rators with expertise in the new \ufb01 eld appear to ease the burden of knowledge and overcome the negative effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on value , they may also de - crease the novelty of inventive output . By contrast , science has a small but positive and signi \ufb01 cant \ufb01 rst - order effect on novelty , increasing new combinations by 0 . 5 % . The interaction effect between exploring new \ufb01 elds and science is also positive and signi \ufb01 cant , in - creasing new combinations by 2 . 0 % . Thus , science positively moderates the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on both novelty and value . Overall , the total effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on novelty , accounting for both \ufb01 rst - order and interaction effects , is positive and sig - ni \ufb01 cant , increasing new combinations by 8 . 3 % . We test the robustness of these results in several ways . A \ufb01 rst potential concern is that one patent is not suf \ufb01 cient to establish the \ufb01 eld of expertise of an inventor . In Models 1 \u2013 4 in Table 3 , we reestimate the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds for the subset of inventors Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 6 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS Table 1 .

The sample includes all patents of inventors that are assigned to a \ufb01 rm , \ufb01 led , and granted between 1975 and 2002 . The sample is restricted to inventors with at least one prior patent ( and , hence , are atthe riskof exploring new \ufb01 elds ) andwho haveatleast two patents assignedto the same \ufb01 rm . The sample includes 2 , 705 , 431 inventor \u2013 patent observations .

We \ufb01 nd con - sistent support for all four hypotheses across all models . As expected , the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds is stronger for inventors with more prior patents , who arguably accumulated more knowledge and expertise . In addition , the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds might differ for more specialized inventors with a narrow \ufb01 eld of expertise compared with inventors with broader expertise . Furthermore , although we include for each focal inventor a control for the number of unique prior coinventors , a potential concern is that the classes of prior patents capture the expertise of the coinventors on the patents rather than the expertise of the focal inventor ( Jones 2009 ) . In Models 5 to 8 in Table 3 , we \ufb01 nd con - sistent support for all hypotheses for the subset of in - ventors with specialization equal to the maximum of one ( all prior patents classi \ufb01 ed in the same class , i . e . , the 75th percentile in the distribution of specialization ) and for the subset of less specialized inventors . In Models 9 \u2013 12 , we \ufb01 nd consistent support for all hypotheses for the subset of inventors with a maximum of two prior co - inventors , that is , the 25th percentile in the distribution of prior collaborations , and for the subset of inventors with more than two prior coinventors . Another potential concern is that we used a conser - vative and discrete measure for exploring new \ufb01 elds , that is , a binary measure indicating there is no overlap between the classes of the focal patent and any of the classes of all prior patents of the focal inventor . As illustrated in Table A . 1 in the online appendix , we \ufb01 nd consistent support for all hypotheses using a less conservative and continuous measure , exploring new \ufb01 elds share , measuring the share of the focal patent \u2019 s three - digit technology class ( es ) new to the focal in - ventor . Furthermore , the distance between the old and the new \ufb01 eld has important implications for the learning process ( Schilling et al . 2003 ) . Because of the large heterogeneity in distance between patent classes , we also calculate \ufb01 eld distance as the weighted average distance between each of the three - digit technology classes of the focal patent and each of the three - digit technology classes linked to all prior patents of the same inventor , weighted by the inventor \u2019 s number of prior patents in the particular class . The distance be - tween two patent classes is calculated as one minus the cosine similarity between two class vectors each cap - turing the joint occurrence of the focal class with all other classes in the population of U . S . patents ( e . g . , Breschi et al . 2003 ) . Each class i is represented as a vector ( P i 1 , P i 2 , . . . P in ) with P ij equal to the number of patents jointly assigned to class i and class j and n the number of distinct patent classes in the U . S . Patent Classi \ufb01 cation System . As illustrated in Table A . 2 in the online appendix , we \ufb01 nd consistent results for all four hypotheses . In line with theory predictions , accounting for distance between \ufb01 elds strengthens the \ufb01 rst - order and interaction effects . Besides testing the robustness of our results using alternative measures for exploring new \ufb01 elds , we test the robustness of our results using alternative outcome measures for novelty and value . We calculate an al - ternative to novelty as new citation combinations , the focal patent \u2019 s number of pairwise combinations of cited patents that appear for the \ufb01 rst time in the patent database ( Uzzi et al . 2013 ) , and include the overall number of cited patents as a control variable . To do so , each pairwise combination of cited patents is compared with all pairwise combinations of all prior U . S . patents . Thus , the measure is calculated in the same way as new combinations except for using cited patents instead of subclasses assigned to a patent . We also calculate an alternative to value as renewals , the number of times a patent is renewed by paying the maintenance fees ( e . g . , Harhoff et al . 1999 ) . A patent can be renewed after four , eight , and 12 years , resulting in the count of re - newals being zero , one , two , or three . As illustrated in Table A . 3 in the online appendix , we \ufb01 nd consistent support for all hypotheses using these alternative outcome measures . A Natural Experiment to Strengthen Causal Inference The Michigan Antitrust Reform Act . Any archival study that purports to link the exploration of new \ufb01 elds with creative output must confront endogeneity issues . As perhaps the most obvious problem , a person might choose to explore new \ufb01 elds to become more creative and had already identi \ufb01 ed a fruitful opportunity . As a further example , more creative people might cross boundaries between \ufb01 elds more successfully because of their diverse knowledge base and cognitive \ufb02 exibility . Alternatively , less productive people might fail to \ufb01 nd continuous employment in their \ufb01 eld of expertise so that they are forced to explore new \ufb01 elds . Finally , because of the increasing burden of knowledge on more recent generations , technical professionals have become in - creasingly specialized so that there is a decreasing tendency to explore new \ufb01 elds over time ( Jones 2009 ) . To address these issues , the study design must provide an exogenous in \ufb02 uence upon exploring new \ufb01 elds ; con - sider similarly productive and creative subjects ; and control for time , \ufb01 eld , and other confounders . We ad - dress each of these in turn . We exploit a natural experiment related to the in - advertent reversal of noncompete enforcement law in Michigan as an exogenous increase in the cost to work in the same \ufb01 eld of expertise at a new employer .

Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 10 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS new \ufb01 elds to avoid a potential lawsuit . A noncompete agreement prevents an ex - employee from working for competitors in the same \ufb01 eld and , hence , exploiting their \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c knowledge and expertise . As such , the change in noncompete labor law exogenously in - creased the cost to continue working in the same \ufb01 eld at a new employer , triggering technical professionals to explore new \ufb01 elds . In 1985 , MARA was passed with the intention of harmonizing state law with the uniform state antitrust act ( Bullard 1985 ) . However , while passing MARA , legislators unintentionally revoked statute 445 . 761 , which prohibited the en - forcement of noncompete agreements in Michigan ( Alterman 1985 ) . After the passing of MARA , em - ployers in Michigan suddenly obtained the legal means to prevent their ex - employees from working in the same \ufb01 eld at a different \ufb01 rm ( Marx et al . 2009 ) . As such , the Michigan experiment provided an exoge - nous pressure on inventors to explore new \ufb01 elds after they left their former employer . The time at which an inventor moves between \ufb01 rms ( pre - or post - MARA ) as well as the inventor \u2019 s state of residence ( Michigan versus non - Michigan ) determine the likelihood that an inventor explored new \ufb01 elds . Our identi \ufb01 cation relies on the fact that only mobile in - ventors residing in Michigan after the passing of MARA are affected ; Michigan inventors before MARA and inventors from other states before and after MARA are not affected by the policy change . Therefore , we can combine differences in exploring new \ufb01 elds between inventors from different states ( Michigan versus non - Michigan ) with differences between cohorts induced by the timing of MARA ( pre - versus post - MARA ) . The interaction between binary indicators for Michigan residence and post - MARA is expected to have a posi - tive signi \ufb01 cant effect on the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01 elds . Thus , this difference - in - differences ( DD ) can be used as an instrument for exploring new \ufb01 elds ( Du \ufb02 o 2001 ) . The DD speci \ufb01 cation controls for overall time trends in exploring new \ufb01 elds ( across all states ) and for time - invariant unobserved differences between Mich - igan and non - Michigan inventors ( Angrist and Pischke 2008 ) . Furthermore , regression DD allows us to include additional inventor and \ufb01 eld characteristics affecting the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01 elds as controls . The main assumption is that , in the absence of MARA , the trend in exploring new \ufb01 elds would not have been systematically different between Michigan and non - Michigan mobile inventors . Sample Selection . In line with prior research , we select all U . S . inventors who patented in Michigan or in an - other nonenforcing state before the passing of MARA in 1985 , including Alaska , California , Connecticut , Minnesota , Montana , Nevada , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Washington , and West Virginia ( Malsberger 1996 ; Marx et al . 2009 , Marx et al . 2015 ) . Inventors who did not patent in a nonenforcing state or only did so after the passing of MARA are excluded to ensure that MARA did not affect sample selection . We track all subsequent patents linked to this set of inventors and assigned to a \ufb01 rm and identify each move between \ufb01 rms ( again , the design relies upon inventors patenting at least twice ) . Only intrastate moves are taken into account because inventors can emigrate from Michigan to a nonenforcing state to avoid a lawsuit ( Marx et al . 2015 ) . Finally , we restrict the analysis to the 1975 \u2013 1995 period , that is , 10 years before and after the passing of MARA . Notice that we collect all patents , both before and after MARA and in and out of Michigan . This results in the full sample of patents by inventors at risk for moving between \ufb01 rms both in Michigan and elsewhere before and after MARA . The resulting data set spans 21 years and consists of 29 , 956 inventors and 162 , 586 patents of which 13 , 723 patents represent a move , that is , the \ufb01 rst subsequent patent of an inventor after moving to a new \ufb01 rm . The \ufb01 nal analysis is restricted to these mobile inventors because the pressure to explore new \ufb01 elds because of MARA only affects inventors who move between \ufb01 rms . Sample Selection Bias . Our sample selection strategy could result in bias because treatment and control subjects were already different before the natural ex - periment , potentially confounding the results . More - over , the natural experiment might affect the selection of treatment subjects , that is , inventors who move between \ufb01 rms in Michigan post - MARA . Although MARA pro - vides an exogenous change in the cost to work in the same \ufb01 eld of expertise at a different employer , more or less creative inventors might respond differently by ( 1 ) staying with their current employer rather than moving to a new \ufb01 rm and having to explore new \ufb01 elds , ( 2 ) moving to a different \ufb01 rm in the same state and pre - sumably exploring new \ufb01 elds , ( 3 ) moving to another state and avoiding a lawsuit , or ( 4 ) stopping work for the time of the agreement . As one example of potential bias , more creative inventors probably have greater bar - gaining power to stay or go and have greater job op - portunities inside or outside the same \ufb01 rm and state . This could in \ufb02 uence their decision to move , the decision of the recruiting \ufb01 rm to hire them , and the decision to be included or excluded from the sample ( Starr et al . 2018 ) . To analyze whether sample selection is likely to affect our results , we compare a battery of inventor charac - teristics of the full population of both mobile and nonmobile inventors , both pre - and post - MARA , both in Michigan and other states . To assess whether our treatment group is different , we calculate binary indicators of Michigan residence , a postmara application date of 1986 or later , and whether a subsequent patent is assigned to a new \ufb01 rm Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS 11 ( and , thus , indicates a move ) . For inventor character - istics , we calculate all the study dependent variables : sum new combinations ( ln ) ( total number of new pairwise subclass combinations for all prior patents of the focal inventor ) ; sum forward citations ( ln ) ( total number of forward citations received within 10 years for all prior patents of the focal inventor ) ; and additional inventor characteristics prior patents ( ln ) , specialization , prior col - laborations ( ln ) , prior move , and days since \ufb01 rst patent ( ln ) . Table A . 4 in the online appendix provides a description and summary statistics for the full population of in - ventors at risk for moving , both before and after MARA and in and out of Michigan . The full interaction between the three indicators \u2014 Michigan , postmara , and move \u2014 identi \ufb01 es any dissimi - larity of the treated inventors . Table A . 5 in the online appendix illustrates that the treatment subjects are not signi \ufb01 cantly different in any of the characteristics . This reduces the likelihood that MARA in \ufb02 uenced selection of the treatment subjects and that our results suffer from sample selection bias . Still , there might be other un - observed inventor characteristics affecting sample se - lection , and hence , caution remains warranted in the causal interpretation of results . Coarsened Exact Matching . In an experiment , one ideally observes two identical groups of subjects over time , whereby one group is affected by an exogenous treatment at a particular point in time . To decrease the chance that pretreatment differences between the treated and control inventors confound the results , we construct a matched subsample of inventors using coarsened exact matching ( CEM ) . This nonparametrical matching method segments the joint distribution of inventor characteristics into a \ufb01 nite number of strata using cut points for each characteristic , resulting in a subsample of similar treatment and control inventors belonging to the same strata while discarding others ( Iacus et al . 2009 , Iacus et al . 2011 ) . We match mobile Michigan inventors to mobile inventors from other states on the following pre - MARA characteristics ( cut points in parentheses ) : ( 1 ) number of prior patents ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \u2013 10 , 11 \u2013 25 , 26 \u2013 50 , > 50 ) , ( 2 ) total number of forward citations received by all prior patents within 10 years ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \u2013 10 , 11 \u2013 25 , 26 \u2013 50 , 51 \u2013 100 , > 100 ) , ( 3 ) total number of new subclass combinations on all prior patents ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \u2013 10 , 11 \u2013 25 , 26 \u2013 50 , 51 \u2013 100 , > 100 ) , ( 4 ) specialization ( 0 , 0 \u2013 0 . 25 , 0 . 25 \u2013 0 . 50 , 0 . 50 \u2013 0 . 75 , > 0 . 75 ) , ( 5 ) whether the inventor previously moved between employers , and ( 6 ) whether the inventor works alone or collaborates ( indicator that is one in case there are no coinventers on prior patents of the inventor ) . Jointly applying these six criteria , we obtain 1 , 969 strata . Only Michigan and non - Michigan mobile inventors for which there is at least one control , respectively , treatment in - ventor in the same stratum are retained . The resulting CEM sample consists of 9 , 270 observations ( 68 % of the original sample ) , which is used as a robustness check for the full sample results . We obtain consistent results using the full and CEM samples and other samples as well . Results . Table 4 provides summary statistics for the full sample of mobile inventors that is used in the analysis . We include two additional control variables that were not used in the inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects analysis . First , we include a binary indicator for in - ventor residence in a nonenforcing state . Although all subjects had at least one prior patent before MARA in a nonenforcing state , they might have moved to an enforcing state afterward . The likelihood of moving between \ufb01 rms and exploring new \ufb01 elds will be dif - ferent for enforcing versus nonenforcing states ( Marx et al . 2009 ) . Second , because the turbulence in the auto industry in Michigan during the observed period ( both pre - and post - MARA ) might affect our results , we include auto industry as a binary indicator for auto patents ( as identi \ufb01 ed by Marx et al . 2009 ) . Table 5 illustrates the differential trends that enable using MARA as a natural experiment , comparing the average rate of exploring new \ufb01 elds \u2014 calculated by dividing the number of patents indicating the explo - ration of new \ufb01 elds by the total number of patents \u2014 for mobile inventors in Michigan versus mobile inventors from other states , both pre - and post - MARA . The av - erage rate of exploring new \ufb01 elds decreased slightly in Michigan post - MARA from 0 . 49 to 0 . 48 . Yet the av - erage rate of exploring new \ufb01 elds decreased sharply in the other states from 0 . 53 to 0 . 43 . This decrease is often attributed to the increasing burden of knowledge that has shifted inventors to become more specialized over time ( Jones 2009 ) . Given that our sample only includes inventors with pre - MARA patents , the decrease is presumably also driven by the declining tendency of inventors to explore new \ufb01 elds later in their career . The difference - in - differences subtracts the difference in the comparison states from the difference in Michigan to determine the net effect of MARA . By doing so , DD controls for the overall declining trend in exploring new \ufb01 elds . The treatment effect of MARA is 0 . 09 , representing a relative increase of 18 % compared with the average pre - MARA rate of exploring new \ufb01 elds in Michigan . To estimate the effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the novelty and value of invention , we use a two - stage least square model ( 2SLS ) . Because the endogenous variable is binary , we use the approach suggested by Angrist ( 2001 ) and Angrist and Pischke ( 2008 ) . For a recent application of the approach , see Galasso and Schankerman ( 2015 ) . First , we estimate the likeli - hood of exploring new \ufb01 elds with a logit model in a difference - in - differences con \ufb01 guration . We include the interaction between Michigan and postmara as an Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 12 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS exogenous variable capturing the effect of the policy reversal . Using logit instead of OLS in the \ufb01 rst stage results in a better \ufb01 t . Second , we calculate the \ufb01 tted probabilities of exploring new \ufb01 elds and use these nonlinear \ufb01 tted values bound between zero and one as an instrument for exploring new \ufb01 elds in the 2SLS models . Using nonlinear \ufb01 tted values as an instrument is the same as plugging in \ufb01 tted values when the \ufb01 rst stage is estimated by OLS , but the advantage is a better predictor of exploring new \ufb01 elds in the \ufb01 rst stage ( Angrist and Pischke 2008 ) . The 2SLS model uses a single instrument , resulting in just - identi \ufb01 ed estimates . Standard errors are clustered at the inventor level to control for repeated observations . Table 6 shows the \ufb01 rst stage predicting the likelihood to explore new \ufb01 elds for both the full and CEM samples . The coef \ufb01 cient of Michigan \u00d7 postmara across the different models im - plies that MARA increased the likelihood of exploring new \ufb01 elds by 6 % \u2013 7 % in absolute terms in addition to the pre - MARA baseline of exploring new \ufb01 elds in Michigan of 49 % . The F statistic for the \ufb01 rst stage regression is consistently above 10 , thus passing conventional tests of instrument strength ( Stock and Yogo 2005 ) . Table 7 displays OLS models and the second stage of the 2SLS models for both the full and CEM samples . It illustrates consistent and predicted results for all hy - potheses . In line with hypothesis 1 , mobile inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds create more novel inventions , increasing new combinations by 6 % \u2013 7 % in the OLS models ( Models 1 \u2013 3 ) and by 48 % \u2013 65 % in the 2SLS models ( Models 4 \u2013 6 ) . Consistent with hypothesis 2 , exploring new \ufb01 elds signi \ufb01 cantly and negatively af - fects the value of inventive output , decreasing forward citations by 1 % \u2013 7 % in the OLS models ( Models 7 \u2013 9 ) and by 41 % \u2013 59 % in the 2SLS models ( Models 10 \u2013 12 ) . The only exception is the nonsigni \ufb01 cance of exploring new \ufb01 elds in Model 7 . 8 Collaboration with experts in the new \ufb01 eld helps an inventor to overcome the learning challenge in the OLS models \u2014 the interaction effect increases citations by 14 % \u2013 16 % ( Models 8 and 9 ) \u2014 but only partially ameliorates the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds in the 2SLS models ; the interaction effect increases citations by 34 % \u2013 36 % ( Models 11 and 12 ) . Similarly , the interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and science is positive and sig - ni \ufb01 cant and compensates the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds in the OLS models , increasing forward citations by 8 % \u2013 11 % ( Models 8 and 9 ) . In the 2SLS models , the interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and science only partially reduces the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds , increasing for - ward citations by 26 % \u2013 35 % ( Models 11 \u2013 12 ) . Nonetheless , interaction effects with expert team and science to - gether also outweigh the negative \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds in the 2SLS models , resulting in a positive total effect on forward citations of 14 % \u2013 18 % ( Models 11 and 12 ) compared with a total effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds of 15 % \u2013 22 % in the OLS models ( Models 8 and 9 ) .

Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS 13 Overall , the results from the 2SLS models are stronger compared with the results of the OLS models and the inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects models , which did not correct for the potential endogeneity of exploring new \ufb01 elds . They are close in magnitude to those re - ported by Hoisl and Rassenfosse ( 2014 ) , who measured inventor mobility with a survey and patent value using forward citations . We offer one potential explanation that MARA provides an exogenous change in the cost to work in the same \ufb01 eld of expertise at a different employer , thereby nudging mobile inventors to explore new \ufb01 elds , compared with a situation in which in - ventors voluntarily explore new \ufb01 elds . Discussion This work makes four main contributions . First , it in - tegrates opposite theories and predictions of the re - lationship between individual \ufb01 eld - speci \ufb01 c expertise and creative output by offering a simple model of search that distinguishes between novelty and value . Second , it provides evidence for the impact of ex - ploring new \ufb01 elds on inventive output , combining inventor \u2013 \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xed effects models on a large population of inventors with difference - in - differences models that exploit a change in labor law as a natural experiment . The models and measures together illustrate how exploring new \ufb01 elds both increases the novelty of inventive output \u2014 arguably because of knowledge diversity and combinatorial opportunities \u2014 but de - creases the value of that output , presumably because of the learning challenge in the new \ufb01 eld . Third , the work suggests potential ways that inventors and \ufb01 rms might overcome the negative impact of exploring new \ufb01 elds through collaboration with experts and reliance on published science in the new \ufb01 eld . Finally , as explored as follows , it extends the implications of a social \u2013 psychological and economic model of invention at the individual level to a regional level . The study has several limitations . First , the typical reservations concerning the use of patent data apply . Not all inventive output is patented and subsequently granted , particularly failed or less successful inventive attempts . Second , the results also rely upon inventor disambiguation and inventors with at least two pat - ents . Third , although an analysis of a larger population of inventors demonstrates that the treatment group affected by the natural experiment is not signi \ufb01 cantly different in any of the observable characteristics , it remains possible that other unobserved characteristics caused inventors and \ufb01 rms to respond differently to the labor law change and thereby resulted in bias . In particular , the unobservable nature of inventors \u2019 stock of ideas might drive selection into moving to a different \ufb01 rm and exploring new \ufb01 elds . Fourth , although we Table 6 .

The sample includes the \ufb01 rst patent of an inventor after the inventor moved between two \ufb01 rms within the same state as evidenced by a different corporate assignee compared with the previous patent of the inventor . The sample is restricted to inventors with at least one prior patent before MARA ( 1985 ) in a nonenforcing state and to patents \ufb01 led between 1975 and 1995 ( n = 13 , 723 inventor \u2013 patent observations ) . CEM indicates subsample of matched inventors using coarsened exact matching ( n = 9 , 270 inventor \u2013 patent observations ) . All models include controls for Michigan , postmara , nonenforcing state , auto industry , prior patents ( ln ) , specialization , prior collaborations ( ln ) , prior move , days since last patent ( ln ) , days since \ufb01 rst patent ( ln ) , team , team prior patents ( ln ) , team specialization , \ufb01 rm prior patents ( ln ) , number of classes ( ln ) , number of subclasses ( ln ) , year and technology class indicators . The interaction Michigan \u00d7 postmara is used as an instrument for exploring new \ufb01 elds in the 2SLS models .

The positive interaction between exploring new \ufb01 elds and expert team might , for example , be driven by the fact that experts help ex post with a better diffusion of the invention rather than by ex ante helping and directing the novice during the invention process itself . The novice might lack legitimacy in the new \ufb01 eld ( Cattani et al . 2017 ) . Or novices with unobserved higher quality ideas might convince experts in the \ufb01 eld to collaborate with them . Similarly , citing scienti \ufb01 c publications might be a proxy for better and more fundamental inventions . Finally , future work might use text to measure pat - ent novelty and similarity ( Arts et al . 2018 , Balsmeier et al . 2018 ) . Our \ufb01 ndings have implications for inventors , their \ufb01 rms , and policymakers . First , and in contrast to prior research that ignores the upside of exploitation , these results illustrate the pitfalls of exploration for individuals and , in turn , for the \ufb01 rms that employ those individuals ( Audia and Goncalo 2007 , Groysberg and Lee 2009 , Hoisl and Rassenfosse 2014 ) . Although exploration connotes bravery , discovery , and suc - cess , reality often means failure , especially in the short term . The current results are consistent with other quasi - experimental work that illustrates per - formance bene \ufb01 ts to exploitation at the \ufb01 rm level ( Balsmeier et al . 2017 ) . This is not a new idea and , indeed , constitutes a central tenet of March \u2019 s ( 1991 ) arguments . Second , we illustrate a practical and legal challenge for technical professionals and the \ufb01 rms that employ them . Firms want to \ufb01 nd professionals with a partic - ular set of skills and expertise , and that expertise has typically been gained at a prior employer ( Tzabbar 2009 , Tzabbar et al . 2015 ) . If the \ufb01 rm operates in a re - gion that enforces noncompetes , it will more often be forced to hire someone with less pertinent skills and retrain that person . The explorative inventor and the inventor \u2019 s \ufb01 rm will suffer decreased value of output ( Groysberg and Lee ( 2009 ) make similar arguments for securities analysts and investment banks ) . This may not be entirely bad as the more technically distant candidate should also create greater novelty . Fur - thermore , embedding the exploration candidate within networks of experts or hiring someone with facility in using the published scienti \ufb01 c literature can greatly mitigate the risks of exploration . One implication of the current work is that individuals who collaborate with experts in the new \ufb01 eld or who can access the literature may overcome the downside of exploration more quickly , and more empirical and insular inventors may take longer . Third , and in nuanced contradiction to Silicon Valley \u2019 s reputation as a hotbed of invention , this work implies that regions that enforce noncompetes invent more novel patents on average . As shown in Table A . 6 in the online appendix , we \ufb01 nd evidence that enforcing states invent patents with more new combinations , on av - erage , but fewer forward citations , and that higher enforceability \u2014 measured by the state - level time - varying enforceability index of Garmaise ( 2009 ) \u2014 relates posi - tively to new combinations and negatively to forward citations . We con \ufb01 rm these predictions using the Michi - gan experiment as an exogenous change in enforceability ( Table A . 7 in the online appendix ) . Conti ( 2014 ) makes a different argument with similar outcomes ; namely , \ufb01 rms consciously undertake riskier research and development because of decreased out - bound mobility of their engineers and assumedly less knowledge leakage . Using changes in Texas and Florida noncompete laws , he illustrated increased en - try of \ufb01 rms into new technology classes . Whether this results from strategic action or unrealized differences in labor mobility remains unclear ( and a good topic for future investigation ) . Independent of resource alloca - tion decisions , our results illustrate how two mobility mechanisms could cause regions that enforce non - competes to invent more novel patents . First , as il - lustrated here , inventors move further in technical distance from their old expertise when changing jobs ; this greater movement results in more novel patents . Second , if inventors \u2019 outside options become more limited , they might be more likely to explore new \ufb01 elds within their current employer as well . Indeed , in un - reported regressions , we found a positive though not always signi \ufb01 cant impact of MARA on intra \ufb01 rm \ufb01 eld exploration as well . The downside is less valuable output as illustrated here . If these mechanisms aggregate to the regional level , then Silicon Valley \u2019 s advantage may derive not from its ability to invent new technologies as much as to exploit and re \ufb01 ne already identi \ufb01 ed and productive trajecto - ries or promising breakthroughs . This line of reasoning implies multiple questions ; for example , are regions that enforce noncompetes doing greater exploration and , in effect , subsidizing search for regions that proscribe their enforcement ? If so , do we see a \ufb02 ow of promising exploration breakthroughs in ideas and / or people from enforcing to nonenforcing regions ? Marx and Fleming ( 2012 ) demonstrate that better inventors ( as measured by citations to their patents or propen - sity to collaborate ) are more likely to emigrate from enforcing to nonenforcing states . Are these inventors carrying more novel and original knowledge as well ? Is novelty planted in regions that enforce but harvested in regions that do not ? Finally , exploring new \ufb01 elds may or may not increase the chance of a breakthrough ; both predictions can be motivated . On the one hand , when a \ufb01 eld - experienced inventor creates novelty , one might expect that novelty Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output 16 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS to have greater future use , on average , because a \ufb01 eld - experienced inventor can probably winnow failures more effectively . On the other hand , when a \ufb01 eld - exploring inventor creates novelty , one might expect greater upside and fertility and less chance of in - cremental improvement . In line with the predictions of Gil \ufb01 llan ( 1935 ) and Kuhn ( 1970 ) that breakthroughs are often made by novices who are new to the \ufb01 eld , the \ufb01 xed effects models illustrate a positive \ufb01 rst - order ef - fect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the likelihood to invent a breakthrough measured as a binary indicator equal to one for patents in the top 5 % in terms of forward ci - tations among patents from the same class and year ( e . g . , Singh and Fleming 2010 , Ahmadpoor and Jones 2017 ) . Results are displayed in Table A . 8 in the online appendix . As such , exploring new \ufb01 elds increases the novelty of inventive output and the chance of a breakthrough but simultaneously reduces the aver - age value of that output ( March 1991 , Fleming 2001 ) . The inclusion of interactions with expert team and science renders the \ufb01 rst - order effect of exploring new \ufb01 elds on the likelihood of breakthrough insigni \ufb01 cant , illustrating that successful exploration bene \ufb01 ts from reliance on scienti \ufb01 c prior art in the new \ufb01 eld or \u2014 to a smaller extent in this context \u2014 collaboration with experts . Unfortunately , the MARA data are too thin to test these predictions , and we lack instruments for ex - pert collaboration and science . Future work should develop and test these ideas in a new context with stronger identi \ufb01 cation . Conclusion Creative search is risky , and the optimal strategy un - certain . Inventors face a fundamental trade - off between local search and exploitation versus distant search and exploration ( March 1991 , Audia and Goncalo 2007 ) . Inventors cannot avoid this fundamental conundrum ; every time they create , they choose \u2014 implicitly or explicitly \u2014 to work within more or less familiar ap - proaches . This endogenous choice , thus , causes \ufb01 rst - order methodological problems in studying the impact of search strategy on inventive output . We approached this problem by considering within \ufb01 rm and inventor \ufb01 xed effects models and an unforeseen labor law re - form that nudged inventors to explore new \ufb01 elds when moving to a new \ufb01 rm . We further exploited difference - in - differences and matching approaches that enabled close comparison of inventors that were and were not affected by the change in labor law . Armed with these methodological tools , we fash - ioned an informal model from two con \ufb02 icting per - spectives . One perspective begins with the returns of specialization and accumulated expertise upon the value of inventive output and implies greater creativity from remaining within the existing \ufb01 elds of exper - tise . Another perspective begins with the value of knowledge diversity and recombinant fecundity and implies the opposite prediction : greater creativity from exploring new \ufb01 elds . We believe both of these argu - ments have merit and contribute to the debate by separately estimating the impact of exploration on two different characteristics of creative output , novelty , and value . Consistent with our informal model , inventors who explore new \ufb01 elds invent more novel patents ; inventors who do not explore new \ufb01 elds invent more valuable patents . Inventors can overcome the dif \ufb01 - culties of exploration and the associated decline in value through collaboration and application of scien - ti \ufb01 c knowledge .

Errors and omissions remain those of the authors . Endnotes 1 As illustrated later , we \ufb01 nd consistent support for all hypotheses using a subsample of inventors with at least 13 prior patents , that is , the 75th percentile in the distribution of prior patents . 2 Our main \ufb01 ndings are robust for the subset of single - authored patents ( e . g . , Jones 2009 ) . Results not shown . 3 We \ufb01 nd consistent results using the number of citations to scienti \ufb01 c literature rather than a binary measure ( results not shown ) . 4 ( ln ) indicates the logarithmic transformation of a measure after adding one for measures with zero values . 5 New combinations and forward citations vary over \ufb01 elds and time . Including additional control variables for the average number of new combinations and for the average number of forward citations re - ceived by patents from the same class and year does not change any of our \ufb01 ndings ( results not shown ) . 6 e ( 0 . 0646 ) \u2212 1 (cid:1) 6 . 7 % . Because all outcome variables capturing novelty and value are calculated as the logarithmic transformation of count measures after adding one and because exploring new \ufb01 elds \u2014 and its interaction with expert team and science \u2014 are binary measures , the marginal effects are calculated as [ e ( estimatedcoefficient ) \u2212 1 ] . The average number of new combinations is 2 . 7 , so a 1 % increase corresponds with an absolute increase of 0 . 03 new combinations per patent , and a 6 . 7 % increase corresponds with an absolute increase of 0 . 18 new combinations per patent ( Table 2 , Model 1 ) . The average number of forward citations is 5 . 99 , so a 1 % decrease corresponds to an absolute decrease of 0 . 06 citations per patent , and a 4 % decrease corre - sponds to an absolute decrease of 0 . 24 citations per patent ( Table 2 , Model 10 ) . 7 We wouldlike to thanka reviewerwho pointed out thesecompeting possibilities . 8 For the MARA sample , the average number of new combinations is 4 . 65 , so a 1 % increase corresponds with an absolute increase of 0 . 05 new combinations per patent , and a 65 % increase corresponds with Arts and Fleming : Exploring New Fields and Inventive Output Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 \u2013 19 , \u00a9 2018 INFORMS 17 an absolute increase of three new combinations per patent . The average number of forward citations is 11 . 22 , so a 1 % decrease corresponds with an absolute decrease of 0 . 11 citations per patent , and a 59 % decrease corresponds with an absolute decrease of 6 . 62 citations per patent .

A BstrAct : Attention for the division of work between computers and humans is growing due to ever - increasing computer capabilities . Over the past decades , creativity support systems ( CSSs ) have gained ground as a means to enhance individual , group , and orga - nizational creativity . Whereas prior research has focused primarily on the main effects of CSSs , we explore the interaction effects with the creative ability of the individual . In this paper , we investigate the use of the case - based reasoning ( CBr ) technology , which is based on the principle of analogical reasoning , to aid individuals in solving business problems creatively . the expectations as to why the CBr technology should enhance individual creativity , and under what conditions ( i . e . , the type and number of cases that are made available ) , are derived from creative cognition theory , and are tested empirically . In a series of studies , a CBr system loaded with a diverse set of cases was found to enhance the performance of individuals with lower creative ability , but it did not help the most creative individuals . Although the literature suggests that cases from remote problem domains should lead to more novel solutions , loading the CBr system only with cases closely related to the problem domain proved more effective than remote cases only . Finally , loading the CBr system with a larger set of diverse cases was found to positively influence the creativity of the solutions . these findings have the following implications for CSSs and creative cognition theory : ( 1 ) when considering the effectiveness of CSSs it is important to take into account the creative 310 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA ability of the individual ( i . e . , \u201cone size does not fit all\u201d ) , ( 2 ) making a sufficiently large and diverse set of cases available is better for stimulating creativity , and ( 3 ) providing cases that are too remote may be counterproductive . On a practical note , organizations seeking to redesign their division of labor between individuals and machines can easily follow the CBr approach presented here using their own set of cases . k ey Words ANd phrAses : case - based reasoning , creative problem solving , creativity sup - port systems , creative cognition theory , domain knowledge , marketing campaigns . N eW decisioN support ApproAches ( e . g . , [ 12 , 25 , 42 , 81 ] ) are often quantitative and geared toward econometrics and operations research ( Or ) , and hence are best suited to support managerial decision making for business problems that are relatively struc - tured . however , as Simon argued , Or - oriented approaches are limited to making choices among a set of alternatives that are given , explicitly or implicitly , in advance . . . . But a great deal of real - world decision making\u2014 perhaps most of it\u2014is concerned with creating alternatives among which choices can be made . the activities that create new alternatives are usually called design activities . [ 69 , p . 14 ] Design problems in management , such as the design of new products , marketing campaigns , and strategic plans , are typically weakly structured , they come with a vast solution space , and often require creative solutions . this renders the use of Or - oriented decision support approaches largely ineffective , as the generation of creative ideas is difficult to capture in a quantitative model . the production of creative ideas constitutes the core of an organization\u2019s capacity to innovate and , as such , is quintessential for survival in highly competitive environ - ments [ 6 , 50 , 80 ] . Over the past two decades , the information systems ( IS ) discipline has increasingly paid attention to the topic of creativity , crystallizing into a distinct stream of research on creativity support systems ( CSSs ) ( see [ 18 , 27 , 28 ] ) . CSSs can be defined as information technology ( It ) \u2013 enabled tools that intend to enhance the creative output of individuals ( e . g . , [ 24 , 29 ] ) or groups of individuals [ 17 , 39 , 64 ] . they range from electronic brainstorming techniques to more exotic approaches , such as guided fantasy and force field analysis ( see [ 18 , 27 , 28 ] ) . given the importance of creativity for all corners of business [ 40 ] , surprisingly few companies actually provide their employees with formal creativity training or support , that is , beyond putting in place ( financial ) incentives [ 13 ] . One of the reasons for the underutilization of CSSs in practice may be the belief that creativity cannot be supported because of its inher - ently ill - structured nature [ 66 ] . According to Sternberg , \u201cfew psychological issues are more interesting , but more intractable , than the issue of creativity\u201d [ 72 , p . vii ] , which is commonly defined as the SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 311 ability to produce work that is both novel ( i . e . , original , unexpected ) and appropri - ate ( i . e . , useful , adaptive concerning task constraints ) ( see [ 5 , 13 , 20 ] ) . Although our understanding of the multitude of factors that influence creativity [ 38 ] has improved significantly , even renowned scholars admit that there is still much we do not know about creativity and how it works exactly [ 73 ] . Fortunately , this has not discouraged researchers from attempting to simulate creativity with computer programs ( e . g . , [ 11 ] ) . Most prior CSS research has focused on design issues , that is , how to incorporate It into the creative process ( e . g . , [ 58 ] ) , or on their effectiveness , that is , whether or not CSSs , on average , enhance creativity ( e . g . , [ 17 , 24 , 29 , 39 , 55 , 64 ] ) . however , it is unlikely that CSSs are equally effective for everyone [ 44 ] because of individual dif - ferences in creative ability , personality , and motivation . the question as to \u201cwho benefits most\u201d from CSSs is relevant from both a theoretical and managerial perspective . We deploy the case - based reasoning ( CBr ) technology , which has been developed in the field of artificial intelligence [ 1 , 45 , 62 ] , to investi - gate this issue . CBr is based on the principle of analogical reasoning ( e . g . , [ 32 ] ) , as it makes knowledge about previous problem - solving episodes available in the form of cases that are similar or analogous to the problem at hand . the knowledge base of a CBr system thus consists of a collection of cases from the domain under study and a set of search criteria for retrieving cases that are similar to the target problem . the cases share a general structure ( e . g . , problem , solution , and outcomes ) and may contain words , numbers , or pictures . Applications of the CBr technology can be found , for example , in architecture , engineering , law , and medicine [ 45 , 48 , 51 ] . A physician may benefit from the use of a CBr system that provides access to cases of treated patients with symptoms similar to those of a new patient . that managers also use analogies routinely , by recalling similar past business situations in order to solve new problems , has been documented , for example , in strategy ( see [ 31 ] ) , finance ( see [ 37 ] ) , and marketing ( see [ 36 ] ) . As analogical reasoning is often associated with creativity ( e . g . , [ 18 , 19 , 39 ] ) , it seems worthwhile to investigate the effectiveness of using CBr systems for solving business problems creatively . CBr systems incorporate features that are said to be quintessential for supporting creativity [ 68 ] , such as ( 1 ) making previous examples or cases available as a source of inspiration , and ( 2 ) providing advanced search facilities to retrieve these previous examples . hence , researchers in areas other than business have started to explore the potential of CBr systems for enhancing creativity ( e . g . , [ 34 , 46 , 54 ] ) . the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . We first discuss our CBr approach in more detail and argue why we expect it to stimulate creativity . We then empirically assess the effectiveness of CBr systems in three laboratory studies by addressing the following questions : ( 1 ) does a CBr system help individuals to produce more creative solutions , and ( 2 ) under what conditions ? the first condition pertains to the creative ability of the individual ( Study 1 ) , that is , who benefits most : creative or noncreative individuals ? the other conditions concern design characteristics of the CBr system , that is , the type of cases ( Study 2 ) and the number of cases ( Study 3 ) stored in the CBr system . 312 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA theoretical Background and hypotheses Domain knowledge and Case - Based reasoning B ecAuse of the humAN miNd \u2019 s excelleNt cApAcity to make novel associations and to combine existing knowledge elements into new solutions , it is well suited to perform creative tasks . Although this capacity is difficult to mimic , CSSs may still be useful for stimulating such mental association and combinatory processes [ 50 ] . Whereas quantitative decision support approaches typically help to narrow down the number of decision alternatives until only the best alternative is left , creativity support tools should help to enlarge the set of decision alternatives . unaided individuals have a tendency to take a \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d [ 77 ] or may suffer from \u201ccognitive inertia\u201d [ 47 , 64 ] , meaning that they search for solutions within highly accessible but bounded areas of their memory , which limits their exploration of the vast solution space and is not likely to produce the most creative solutions [ 63 , 64 , 77 ] . how may a CBr system filled with old cases help to generate more creative solu - tions ? the use of existing knowledge seems counterproductive when the goal is to produce something new . however , as Ward argues , \u201ccreative ideas do not appear , ex nihilo , full - blown in the mind of their originators , but rather must be crafted from the person\u2019s existing knowledge\u201d [ 79 , p . 176 ] . Descriptions of the creative process , such as \u201cusing old solutions in novel ways\u201d [ 46 , p . 19 ] and \u201cnovel combinations of old ideas\u201d [ 11 , p . 75 ] , stress that creative ideas are often rooted in existing knowledge . Some even suggest that profound knowledge of a domain is crucial for producing solutions that are not only novel but also useful ( e . g . , [ 70 ] ) . however , the use of a CBr system may also have adverse effects , as the provision of previous cases could induce fixation effects that inhibit \u201cout - of - the - box\u201d think - ing . In other words , the knowledge structures that the provided cases activate in the person\u2019s mind may impede access to other areas of the solution space . In general , the ease with which knowledge can be accessed and retrieved from long - term memory largely depends on the frequency of use , that is , \u201cfrequent use of particular cognitive structures enhances the chronic accessibility of these structures\u201d [ 63 , p . 935 ] . this explains the tendency of individuals , when unaided , to think primarily within highly accessible areas of their memory , since it requires less effort [ 64 , 77 ] . to boost creativ - ity , people thus need to be stimulated to explore the solution space more thoroughly . this is exactly what most current techniques , such as brainstorming and guided fantasy [ 18 ] , try to accomplish . Nonetheless , retrieving relevant knowledge from less accessible parts of memory can be difficult for people [ 33 ] . A CBr system facilitates easy and unbiased access to relevant knowledge stored in an external case base ( or organizational memory ) [ 71 ] . Creative Ability the creative problem - solving process typically involves iterative phases of problem formulation , preparation , idea generation , evaluation , and selection [ 5 ] . this requires SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 313 not only generative cognitive processes to produce a diverse set of candidate solu - tions but also exploratory cognitive processes to select and refine the most promising ones [ 26 ] . A creative person should thus be good at divergent as well as convergent thinking [ 44 ] . Divergent thinking is the ability to generate many diverse ideas in response to an open - ended problem and comprises the cognitive subskills of \u201cfluency\u201d ( number of ideas ) , \u201cflexibility\u201d ( diversity of ideas ) , and \u201coriginality\u201d ( rarity of ideas ) . Divergent thinking is essential for creativity , but convergent thinking is needed to select and work out the most promising idea ( s ) [ 60 ] . In business , it is eventually the quality of the best idea that counts more than the sheer number of ideas . In a comprehensive review of applied creativity in business , kabanoff and rossiter [ 43 ] concluded that , when the task is unstructured , the largest contributing factor to creative performance is the creative ability of the individual . however , con - textual factors , such as training , incentives , and the use of CSSs , are likely to moder - ate the ability of the individual to perform creatively [ 80 ] . Whereas earlier work has focused predominantly on the main effects of using CSSs ( notable exceptions are [ 44 , 53 ] ) , we explicitly examine interaction effects between the use of a CBr system and the creative ability of the individual . the Effects of the use of a CBr System on Creativity thus far we have argued that a CBr system loaded with domain knowledge in the form of cases can open up the solution space by enlarging a person\u2019s \u201cnetwork of possible wanderings\u201d [ 59 , p . 82 ] , which may help to produce more creative solutions . But if these solutions are crafted from existing knowledge , then where exactly does their novelty come from ? Based on contemporary creative cognition research ( e . g . , [ 21 , 26 , 63 , 64 ] ) , we propose two routes through which the provision of domain knowledge can enhance novelty : by increasing ( 1 ) the depth of exploration of the solution space and ( 2 ) the breadth of exploration of the solution space . the rationale is that the first ideas that people generate are usually the most obvious ones based on highly acces - sible knowledge structures [ 63 , 64 , 77 ] . If the cognitive effort to produce additional ideas within a particular category becomes too high , people may switch to a different category of ideas or stop generating ideas altogether . But when they are stimulated to explore the solution space more thoroughly , more original solutions may emerge . to increase the depth of exploration of the solution space , it may be useful to activate easily accessible knowledge prior to the creative task ( see [ 63 ] ) . rietzschel et al . [ 63 ] found that such a preactivation of highly accessible knowledge ( and the spreading of activation in memory ; see [ 64 ] ) stimulated individuals to explore the activated idea categories more deeply , resulting in the production of more novel ideas . to increase the breadth of exploration of the solution space , less accessible , more remote knowledge could be activated prior to the creative task . this is also why cross - functional teams are said to be more creative ( e . g . , [ 22 , 74 ] ) , since each member brings a unique set of perspectives , experiences , and knowledge to bear on the creative task . this will broaden the exploration of the solution space , resulting in the generation of more novel ideas . hence , we expect that a CBr system filled with a diverse set of cases , that is , 314 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA close cases can stimulate a deeper exploration , whereas remote cases can stimulate a broader exploration of the solution space . Although the manner in which rietzschel et al . [ 63 ] activated domain knowledge ( prior to the task ) had a positive effect on the novelty of the generated ideas , it did not improve the usefulness of these ideas . In their study , increases in novelty came basically at the expense of the practicality of the ideas . the provision of domain knowledge in the form of ( successful ) past cases has the advantage that it can also enhance the usefulness of the generated ideas [ 30 , 44 ] . Moreover , individuals do not have to rely solely on their own , biased memory , as they have an external knowledge base at their disposal . to summarize , we expect that a CBr system loaded with a diverse set of cases has the potential to stimulate both divergent and convergent thinking processes [ 44 ] , which is considered to be crucial for CSSs in order to enhance the novelty as well as the usefulness of the solutions effectively [ 58 ] . Hypothesis 1 : Individuals who use a CBR system loaded with diverse cases will produce more novel , more useful , and overall more creative solutions than indi - viduals who do not use such a CBR system . the Interaction Between CBr System and Creative Ability It has been argued that \u201ccreative thinking techniques are not a one - size - fits - all propo - sition\u201d [ 44 , p . 307 ] , because each individual \u201cbrings to the creative thinking process different kinds of abilities and knowledge that need to be taken into account in order to identify the creative thinking techniques that are most useful to them\u201d [ 44 , p . 299 ] . however , most prior CSS studies have not explored this issue , but have treated the creative ability of the individual as randomly distributed across experimental groups or conditions ( e . g . , [ 65 ] ) or as one of the covariates in the analyses ( e . g . , [ 39 , 55 ] ) . the few studies that investigated interaction effects between the individual and the CSS are inconclusive as to who benefits most , that is , creative or noncreative individuals . MacCrimmon and Wagner [ 53 ] found that the use of a CSS enhanced the performance of highly creative individuals most , suggesting a reinforcement effect of the CSS . however , Cheung et al . [ 15 ] reported a decrease in the performance of highly creative individuals when they used a CSS . Empirical evidence in the broader decision support systems literature seems in favor of a compensatory effect . that is , for relatively structured problems that require analytical problem solving , the use of analytical decision support systems has been shown to be more beneficial for nonanalytical individuals than for analytical individuals ( e . g . , [ 8 , 76 ] ) . Extrapolating this finding to the realm of CSSs suggests that noncreative individuals may benefit more than creative individuals . Such a compensatory effect of the use of CSSs would also be congruent with creative cognition theories that advocate the use of examples or templates ( e . g . , [ 26 , 67 ] ) . Providing people with examples , as a CBr system does in the form of cases , has been shown to influence positively the number of generated solutions [ 55 ] and the creativity of the solutions [ 67 ] . the abil - ity to generate many diverse ideas ( i . e . , fluency and flexibility ) , including novel ones SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 315 ( originality ) , is what people with a low creative ability lack . hence , we may expect them to benefit more from the use of a CBr system . given the scarce and mixed evidence so far , we will address the question as to who benefits most empirically . RQ1 : To what extent do the effects of a CBR system loaded with diverse cases depend on the creative ability of the individual ? the domain of our empirical studies , which are discussed next , is the design of creative sales promotion campaigns . Sales promotions are direct , short - term induce - ments to buy a product or service now , such as price discounts , coupons , free samples , sweepstakes , contests , and giveaways [ 10 ] . Such campaigns are organized with a relatively high frequency and are often the responsibility of a single person , typically the brand or product manager . this will be the setting in which we test the effective - ness of our CBr approach for enhancing individual creativity , which eventually may benefit the organization as a whole . Study 1 Design and Participants t o test h1 , We devised A BetWeeN - suBjects experimeNt in which one group of partici - pants ( n = 20 ) was given a CBr system filled with a diverse set of cases , plus a sales promotion technique inventory on paper ( more details are given in the treatments subsection ) . the other group of participants ( n = 20 ) received only the sales promo - tion technique inventory on paper . Forty marketing students from a Dutch university participated in this study . 1 the participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups . gender and education level were found to be proportionally distributed over the two groups ( gender : 65 percent male ; education level : 70 percent master\u2019s degree and 30 percent bachelor\u2019s degree ) . task and Procedure In order to create a motivation for maximum performance , the study was announced as a sales promotion campaign design contest . the study took place in the university\u2019s behavioral laboratory . We organized eight three - hour sessions with an average of five students per session , who worked on the task individually in isolated cubicles . At the beginning of each session , they collectively took a 15 - minute creative ability test ( more details can be found in the Measures subsection ) . Next , the participants were asked to read the task description and a short document on how to use the available support . 2 the lead researcher had to clarify or answer about five ( technical ) questions per session . When ready , the participants were told to save their campaign proposal on the computer and were given a survey containing a number of process measures ( see the Post hoc Analyses section ) . After completing the survey , the participants received compensation of 30 euros . 316 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA A Dutch beer brewery gave permission to use one of their campaign briefs in our study . the participant\u2019s task was to write a proposal for a campaign that had to boost brand loyalty and enhance the image of the brand . the campaign had to be targeted at the \u201cheavy - user\u201d segment with \u201clive music\u201d as the main theme . the brief included a number of practical constraints : ( 1 ) the promotion had to apply to crates ( containing 30 cl [ centiliter ] or 45 cl bottles ) , ( 2 ) promotional items should not be attached to the sides of the crates , and ( 3 ) the value of the promotional offer should not exceed 5 euros per crate . the campaign proposal had to contain a brief description of ( 1 ) the basic idea , ( 2 ) the sales promotion technique , ( 3 ) supporting activities , and ( 4 ) a rough cost estimation . the task thus involved all the phases of the creative process , including a divergent ( generating ideas ) and a convergent phase ( selecting and working out the best idea ) [ 5 ] . the participants were instructed not to copy one of the brand\u2019s previ - ous campaigns ( see [ 67 ] ) . they were also told that experts would rate their campaign proposal on novelty and usefulness ( see [ 10 ] ) . treatments to fill the case - base of the CBr system , we collected descriptions of 100 award - winning campaigns in Europe from the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s . the cases were taken from two books : Scoren [ 56 ] and European Sales Promotion : Great Campaigns in Action [ 75 ] . Examples of how these cases were stored in the CBr system , which we called LEAPS , 3 are given in Appendix A ( close case ) and Appendix B ( remote case ) . the search structure of the CBr system consisted of the following components : ( 1 ) general information about the case ; ( 2 ) problem situation , including market situ - ation , campaign objectives , and constraints ; ( 3 ) solution , including campaign design and campaign execution ; and ( 4 ) outcomes . this search structure contained 60 differ - ent variables . users could search for cases by specifying the parameters they deemed relevant given the problem situation . the search values were mostly qualitative in nature , such as \u201cintroduction , \u201d \u201cgrowth , \u201d \u201cmaturity , \u201d and \u201cdecline\u201d for the variable \u201cproduct life cycle phase . \u201d users could also attach importance weights to the search variables ( ranging from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201cvery high\u201d ) . the importance weights could be inferred from the campaign brief . to prevent information overload , the CBr system displayed only the ten most similar past cases . the similarity between the search query and the cases in the CBr system was calculated using a distance - based measure ( ranging from 0 = \u201cno similarity\u201d to 1 = \u201cperfect similarity\u201d ) . 4 users were free to run multiple search queries . the large number of search variables , the qualitative nature of the search values , the option to assign importance weights , the possibility of running multiple search queries , and the display of multiple cases that differ in their degree of similarity to the target problem ensure sufficient freedom to wander through the solution space and discover unexpected but relevant knowledge that may stimulate creativity ( see [ 7 ] ) . Instead of manipulating the search structure or the search process , we focused on the role of the content of the case base , that is , the type and number of cases stored in the CBr system ( see Studies 2 and 3 ) .

It should be noted that this paper document was also made available to the participants in the CBr system condition . the inventory contained a basic description of sales promotion techniques ( such as sampling or organizing a contest ) together with the most salient pros and cons of each technique ( such as aptitude for inducing trial , implementation times , and predictability of the costs ) . the descriptions were taken from textbooks and verified by experts ( who also verified the CBr system\u2019s search structure ) . All the participants were told that they could use the available support as well as their imagination . Measures Creative Ability . to measure the creative ability of the participants , we used the Abbreviated torrance test for Adults ( AttA ) developed and validated by goff and torrance [ 35 ] ( see also [ 4 ] ) . this test is a brief 15 - minute version of the torrance tests of Creative thinking and measures the following cognitive subskills of creative thinking : fluency ( number of ideas ) , flexibility ( diversity of ideas ) , originality ( rar - ity of ideas ) , and elaboration ( embellishment of ideas with details ) , together with 15 other creativity indicators , such as \u201crichness and colorfulness of imagery\u201d and \u201chumor : conceptual incongruity . \u201d the AttA test consists of one verbal and two fig - ural response tasks . two independent , trained raters scored the responses to the tasks . With raters considered in agreement whenever their scores differed no more than one point on a seven - point scale ( 1 = \u201cminimal\u201d to 7 = \u201csubstantial\u201d ) ( see [ 23 , 63 ] ) , there was agreement in 100 percent of the cases . We also calculated the r wg coefficient as an index of within - group interrater agreement [ 41 ] . the mean r wg for the creative ability scores was 0 . 97 ( range : 0 . 85 \u2013 1 . 00 ) , indicating strong agreement [ 52 ] . 5 hence , we combined the scores of the raters . the mean creative ability level was 4 . 7 ( SD [ standard deviation ] = 1 . 3 ) with no significant difference between the two groups ( t ( 38 ) = 0 . 422 , p = 0 . 675 ) . Dependent Variables : Novelty , Usefulness , and Overall Creativity . For measuring the novelty of the solution , we selected three items ( i . e . , originality , surprise , and uniqueness ) from Besemer and O\u2019Quin\u2019s [ 9 ] Creative Product Semantic Scale , which is a well - known instrument for evaluating creative products [ 60 ] . For measuring use - fulness , we selected four items from the same scale . We slightly adapted the items to fit the objectives stated in the campaign brief . the four items were effectiveness for increasing the loyalty of heavy users , fit with the brand values , attractiveness for heavy users , and the overall usefulness of the campaign . All seven items were measured on a scale from 0 ( very poor ) to 10 ( excellent ) . Following Amabile [ 5 ] , we asked three experts to rate independently all of the campaign proposals . two of the experts were creative directors of renowned Dutch marketing agencies . the other expert was the beer brewery\u2019s senior marketing manager in charge of the original campaign . two of the experts had also served as chairmen of the annual Dutch Sales Promotion Campaign Awards . the experts were blind to the study design . All the proposals were given an identical layout and were sent to the 318 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA experts in randomized batches of 20 proposals . there were no order or batch effects . It took about four hours to rate all 40 proposals . the novelty items and the usefulness items showed high internal consistency for all experts ( Cronbach \u03b1 s > 0 . 86 ) . thus , we averaged the individual item scores to obtain a single \u201cnovelty\u201d score and a single \u201cusefulness\u201d score per expert . to obtain an \u201coverall creativity\u201d score for each expert , we averaged these novelty and usefulness scores ( see [ 13 , 55 ] ) . In terms of interrater agreement , the experts\u2019 scores differed by no more than two points on an 11 - point scale in 93 percent of the cases for novelty , 93 percent for usefulness , and 92 percent for overall creativity . We also calculated the multiple - item r wg ( j ) coefficients [ 41 ] . the mean r wg ( j ) coefficients were 0 . 90 for novelty ( range : 0 . 00 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 92 . 5 percent > 0 . 70 ) , 0 . 91 for usefulness ( range : 0 . 00 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 95 percent > 0 . 70 ) , and 0 . 91 for overall creativity ( range : 0 . 07 \u2013 0 . 99 ; with 92 . 5 percent > 0 . 70 ) . hence , we combined the novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity scores across experts ( M = 6 . 3 , SD = 0 . 75 for novelty ; M = 5 . 9 , SD = 0 . 80 for usefulness ; and M = 6 . 1 , SD = 0 . 72 for overall creativity ) . Covariates . We included two covariates commonly used in creativity research , namely gender and education level . the length of the proposal was also taken into account , as the sheer number of words has been shown to influence expert ratings of solution quality [ 52 ] . results and Discussion Because of the continuous nature of the creative ability measure , we performed a series of moderated regression analyses following the procedure outlined by Aiken and West [ 2 ] . We regressed the dependent variables ( novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity ) on the ( mean - centered ) independent variables : a dummy variable for the CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases , the participants\u2019 creative ability , a mul - tiplicative term of these two variables , and the covariates ( gender , education level , and length of the proposal ) . table 1 gives the standardized regression coefficients , the standard errors , and the increase in R 2 due to the inclusion of the interaction term . the results show a positive effect of the CBr system with 100 diverse cases on the usefulness of the solutions ( \u03b2 = 0 . 26 , t = 1 . 983 , p = 0 . 028 ; right - tailed ) , but the effect on novelty is not significant ( \u03b2 = 0 . 17 , t = 1 . 125 , p = 0 . 135 ; right - tailed ) . We also find a positive main effect of the CBr system with 100 diverse cases on the overall creativ - ity of the solutions ( \u03b2 = 0 . 23 , t = 1 . 695 , p = 0 . 050 ; right - tailed ) , which is in line with h1 . the main effects are , however , qualified by a significant CBr system \u00d7 creative ability interaction for novelty ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 41 , t = \u2013 2 . 769 , p = 0 . 009 ) , usefulness ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 45 , t = \u2013 3 . 406 , p = 0 . 002 ) , and overall creativity ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 47 , t = \u2013 3 . 376 , p = 0 . 002 ) . Following the recommendations of Aiken and West [ 2 ] , we investigated the nature of these interaction effects by calculating the simple effects of the CBr system at one standard deviation above and below the mean of creative ability . the results revealed a positive effect of the use of the CBr system with 100 diverse cases on the overall creativity of the solutions for individuals with a low creative ability ( \u03b2 = 0 . 70 , SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 319 t = 3 . 610 , p < 0 . 001 ) , but not for highly creative individuals ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 24 , t = \u2013 1 . 218 , p = 0 . 232 ) . 6 the nature of the interaction effect for overall creativity is displayed in Figure 1 ( note that the results were similar for novelty and usefulness ) . thus , we may conclude that the positive effect of the CBr system with diverse cases on the novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity of the solutions was stronger for individuals with a low creative ability than for highly creative individuals , who did not benefit from the CBr system with diverse cases . In Study 1 , the CBr system contained a broad variety of cases , ranging from campaigns for beer brands ( the same product category ) to campaigns for insurance products ( a very different product category ) . this begs the question whether the type of cases stored in the CBr system influences the creativity of the solutions . Dahl and Moreau [ 19 ] , for example , argued that analogies coming from very different problem domains should lead to more novel solutions than analogies coming from basically the same problem domain . given the stark differences between individuals with a low and high creative ability in Study 1 , the question of \u201cwho benefits most from which type of cases\u201d also seems pertinent . to address these questions , we manipulated the type of cases stored in the CBr system in Study 2 . table 1 . the Effects of a CBr System with Diverse Cases on Creativity ( Study 1 ) Variables Novelty usefulness Overall creativity CBR system ( 100 diverse cases ) 0 . 17 ( 0 . 22 ) 0 . 26 * ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 23 * ( 0 . 20 ) Creative ability 0 . 25 ( 0 . 09 ) 0 . 10 ( 0 . 09 ) 0 . 18 ( 0 . 08 ) CBR system ( 100 diverse cases ) \u00d7 creative ability \u2013 0 . 41 * * ( 0 . 17 ) \u2013 0 . 45 * * ( 0 . 17 ) \u2013 0 . 47 * * ( 0 . 15 ) Covariates Gender \u2013 0 . 13 ( 0 . 24 ) \u2013 0 . 26 \u2020 ( 0 . 23 ) \u2013 0 . 21 ( 0 . 22 ) Education level 0 . 04 ( 0 . 24 ) 0 . 28 * ( 0 . 23 ) 0 . 18 ( 0 . 21 ) Length of proposal 0 . 13 ( 0 . 00 ) 0 . 05 ( 0 . 00 ) 0 . 10 ( 0 . 00 ) R 2 0 . 29 0 . 43 0 . 38 F 2 . 27 \u2020 4 . 15 * * 3 . 44 * * \u2206 R 2 ( due to the inclusion of the interaction term ) 0 . 17 0 . 20 0 . 21 F for \u2206 R 2 7 . 90 * * 11 . 96 * * 11 . 74 * * Notes : n = 40 .

Men tended to produce more useful solutions than women . \u2020 p \u2264 0 . 10 ; * p \u2264 0 . 05 ; * * p \u2264 0 . 01 . 320 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA Study 2 the Effects of the CBr System\u2019s Content : Close Versus remote Cases W ith regArd to the type of cAses , a distinction can be made between close cases , which come from basically the same problem domain , and remote cases , which come from more distant or even \u201cwildly discrepant\u201d problem domains [ 16 , 78 , 79 ] . For example , when a marketer has to design a creative campaign for a beer brand , he or she may find inspiration in previous campaigns organized by the same or other beer brands ( close cases ) , but also in campaigns organized for cars or insurance products ( remote cases ) . Earlier we argued that the use of a CBr system might help to increase the depth and breadth of exploration of the solution space [ 63 ] . More specifically , close cases are expected to enhance the depth of exploration of the solution space , whereas remote cases are expected to enhance the breadth of exploration . Both types of exploration may lead to novel solutions , but prior research suggests that remote cases will enhance novelty more than close cases ( e . g . , [ 19 ] ) . the rationale is that using remote cases requires more cognitive effort , because the similarities with the target problem exist at an abstract level only [ 32 ] . Simply put , the use of remote cases requires \u201cmental leaps , \u201d whereas the use of close cases only requires \u201cmental hops\u201d [ 78 ] . Due to the greater conceptual distance between the base and the target problem , solutions based on remote cases may be less obvious and thus more novel . however , this greater distance is also likely to produce less useful solutions than those based on close cases . Hypothesis 2 : Individuals who use a CBR system loaded with remote cases only will produce more novel but less useful solutions than individuals who use a CBR system loaded with close cases only . In Study 1 , individuals with a low creative ability were helped more by a CBr system with 100 diverse cases than individuals with a high creative ability . But what if the CBr system contains only remote cases ? Since highly creative individuals , by Figure 1 . Study 1 : Interaction Between Creative Ability and the use of a CBr System SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 321 definition , are more flexible in their thinking , it might be easier for them to work with cases that are remote from the target problem than for individuals with a low creative ability ( for whom the use of such cases could be too demanding ) . the latter probably benefit more from close cases , as these cases require only \u201cmental hops . \u201d Nonetheless , close cases can still stimulate a deeper exploration of the solution space and , hence , may lead to more novel solutions , but less so than remote cases that are expected to stimulate a broader exploration of the solution space . RQ2 : To what extent do the effects of a CBR system loaded with remote cases only depend on the creative ability of the individual ? Design and Participants Study 2 was identical to Study 1 , except for the experimental treatments . Of the CBr system with 100 diverse cases used in Study 1 , 50 cases were classified as \u201cclose\u201d and 50 as \u201cremote\u201d based on the product category ( see [ 16 ] ) . Campaigns for consumer - packaged goods ( cpg ) , such as beer and soft drinks , are quite different from campaigns for consumer durables or services ( non - cpg ) , such as cars or insurance products . Since beer is a consumer - packaged good , we classified all cpg cases as \u201cclose\u201d and all non - cpg cases as \u201cremote . \u201d to test h2 , we devised a between - subjects study in which one group of participants ( n = 20 ) was given a CBr system with remote cases only , while the other group ( n = 20 ) received a CBr system with close cases only . Forty marketing students from the same university as in Study 1 were randomly assigned to one of the two groups . gender and education level were again found to be proportionally distributed over the two groups ( gender : 73 percent male ; education level : 70 percent master\u2019s degree , 30 percent bachelor\u2019s degree ) . Measures the same raters as in Study 1 scored the participants\u2019 responses to the AttA test . their scores differed by no more than one point ( on a seven - point scale ) in 100 percent of the cases . We also calculated the mean r wg coefficient , which was a high 0 . 97 ( range : 0 . 85 \u2013 1 . 00 ) . thus , we combined the scores of the two raters . the mean creative ability level was 4 . 9 ( SD = 1 . 4 ) , with no significant difference between the two groups ( t ( 38 ) = 0 . 561 , p = 0 . 578 ) . the same experts as in Study 1 agreed to evaluate the campaign proposals . As for interrater agreement , their scores differed by no more than two points ( on an 11 - point scale ) in 98 percent of the cases for novelty , 97 percent for usefulness , and 98 percent for overall creativity . the mean r wg ( j ) coefficients were 0 . 97 for novelty ( range : 0 . 84 \u2013 1 . 00 ) , 0 . 93 for usefulness ( range : 0 . 25 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 97 . 5 percent > 0 . 70 ) , and 0 . 96 for overall creativity ( range : 0 . 76 \u2013 1 . 00 ) . hence , we combined the novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity scores across experts ( M = 6 . 2 , SD = 0 . 64 for novelty ; M = 5 . 7 , SD = 0 . 65 for usefulness ; and M = 5 . 9 , SD = 0 . 57 for overall creativity ) . 322 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA results and Discussion As in Study 1 , we regressed the dependent variables ( novelty , usefulness , and over - all creativity ) on the ( mean - centered ) independent variables : a dummy variable for the CBr system loaded with remote cases only , the participants\u2019 creative ability , a multiplicative term of these two variables , and the same covariates . the results are presented in table 2 . Contrary to our expectations ( h2 ) , the use of a CBr system loaded with remote cases only , as compared with a CBr system loaded with close cases only , neither positively influenced the novelty of the solutions ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 25 , t = \u2013 1 . 625 , p = 0 . 943 ; right - tailed ) , nor did it significantly affect the usefulness of the solutions ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 21 , t = \u2013 1 . 287 , p = 0 . 104 ; left - tailed ) . thus , we may conclude that a CBr system with remote cases only does not lead to more novel , but less useful , solutions than a CBr system with close cases only . however , there was a marginally significant negative effect of the CBr system loaded with remote cases only on the overall creativity of the solutions ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 26 , t = \u2013 1 . 695 , p = 0 . 098 ) .

SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 323 remote cases only and creative ability was significant for overall creativity ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 31 , t = \u2013 2 . 208 , p = 0 . 034 ) and for usefulness ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 31 , t = \u2013 2 . 102 , p = 0 . 043 ) , but not for novelty ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 24 , t = \u2013 1 . 666 , p = 0 . 105 ) . A closer investigation of this interaction effect for overall creativity revealed that the CBr system loaded with remote cases only had a negative impact for individuals with a high creative ability ( \u03b2 = \u2013 0 . 58 , t = \u2013 2 . 810 , p = . 008 ) , but there was no significant effect for individuals with a low creative ability ( \u03b2 = 0 . 06 , t = 0 . 26 , p = . 790 ) . the nature of this interaction effect is displayed in Figure 2 ( note that the results were similar for usefulness ) . thus , we may conclude that the use of a CBr system with remote cases only decreased the usefulness and overall creativity of the solutions proposed by highly creative individuals . this negative effect is intriguing and may explain why highly creative individuals did not perform better in Study 1 . For them , remote cases seem to work as distractors rather than facilitators . We come back to this issue in the Post hoc Analyses section . So far , we have investigated the effectiveness of a CBr system loaded with a diverse set of cases for enhancing the creativity of individuals with different levels of creative ability ( Study 1 ) and explored the role of the type of cases stored in the CBr system ( Study 2 ) . Because we had only 50 close cases and 50 remote cases at our disposal , the CBr systems inevitably contained different numbers of cases ( i . e . , 100 in Study 1 versus 50 in Study 2 ) . In Study 3 , we therefore investigate the role of the number of cases stored in the CBr system . Study 3 the Effects of the Content of the CBr System : More Versus Fewer Cases i N the literAture Not oNly the diversity of kNoWledge is argued to positively influence creativity but the amount of available knowledge may also play a role [ 57 ] . Moorman and Miner [ 57 ] found that the amount of knowledge made available to employees in Figure 2 . Study 2 : Interaction Between Creative Ability and type of Cases in the CBr System 324 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA organizations was positively related to the financial performance of their new products ( cf . usefulness ) , although they did not find a significant impact on the creativity of these products . Accordingly , we expect that the number of cases stored in the CBr system may positively influence the usefulness of the solutions . the rationale is that having more cases stored in the CBr system increases the likelihood of retrieving cases that are relevant to the problem at hand . More relevant cases are likely to lead to more useful solutions . Since any case may activate knowledge in a person\u2019s mind and , hence , stimulate a deeper or broader exploration of the solution space , we do not expect an effect of the number of cases stored in the CBr system on the novelty of the solutions . Hypothesis 3 : Individuals who use a CBR system loaded with more diverse cases will produce more useful solutions than individuals who use a CBR system loaded with fewer diverse cases . Based on the results of Study 1 , we also expect that individuals with a low creative ability will benefit more from a CBr system with a larger number of cases than highly creative individuals . thus , we formulate the following research question : RQ3 : To what extent do the effects of a CBR system loaded with more diverse cases depend on the creative ability of the individual ? Design and Participants Study 3 was identical to the previous ones , except for the experimental treatments . We compared the group of participants ( n = 20 ) of Study 1 who used the CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases with a new group of participants ( n = 20 ) who were given a CBr system loaded with 50 diverse cases ( randomly selected out of the 100 cases ) . Both CBr systems contained a 50 / 50 mix of close and remote cases . twenty marketing students from the same university were recruited to use the CBr system loaded with 50 diverse cases . gender and education level were again found to be proportionally distributed over the two groups ( gender : 65 percent male ; education level : 80 percent master\u2019s degree and 20 percent bachelor\u2019s degree ) . Measures Again , the same two trained raters scored the responses to the AttA test . their scores differed by no more than one point ( on a seven - point scale ) in 100 percent of the cases . We also calculated the mean r wg coefficient , which was a high 0 . 97 ( range : 0 . 85 \u2013 1 . 00 ) . hence , we combined the scores of the two raters . the mean creative abil - ity level was 4 . 8 ( SD = 1 . 3 ) with no significant difference between the two groups ( t ( 38 ) = 0 . 296 , p = 0 . 769 ) . the new campaign proposals were rated by the same experts . As for interrater agreement , their scores differed by no more than two points ( on an 11 - point scale ) in 92 percent of the cases for novelty , 91 percent for usefulness , and 92 percent for overall creativity . the mean r wg ( j ) coefficients were 0 . 90 for novelty SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 325 ( range : 0 . 00 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 90 percent > 0 . 70 ) , 0 . 90 for usefulness ( range : 0 . 00 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 92 . 5 percent > 0 . 70 ) , and 0 . 95 for overall creativity ( range : 0 . 47 \u2013 1 . 00 ; with 97 . 5 per - cent > 0 . 70 ) . hence , we averaged the novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity scores across experts ( M = 6 . 3 , SD = 0 . 65 for novelty ; M = 5 . 9 , SD = 0 . 83 for usefulness ; and M = 6 . 1 , SD = 0 . 68 for overall creativity ) . results and Discussion We regressed the dependent variables ( novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity ) on the ( mean - centered ) independent variables : a dummy variable for the CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases , the participants\u2019 creative ability , a multiplicative term of these two variables , and the same covariates . the results are presented in table 3 . In agreement with h3 , we found a positive effect of the CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases ( versus 50 diverse cases ) on the usefulness of the solutions ( \u03b2 = 0 . 33 , t = 2 . 457 , p = 0 . 010 ; right - tailed ) .

Figure 3 shows the nature of this interaction effect for overall creativity ( note that the results were similar for usefulness ) . Post hoc Analyses t Wo iNtriguiNg questioNs ArisiNg from the results deserve AtteNtioN : ( 1 ) Why did remote cases not have a positive effect on novelty ? and ( 2 ) Why did highly creative individuals not benefit from a CBr system , and the one with remote cases in particu - lar ? to address these questions , we performed a number of post hoc analyses on the process data that we collected at the end of each study . the participants were asked to report the cases that they had read ( \u201ccases read\u201d ) and the cases that had inspired them or from which they had taken elements ( \u201ccases used\u201d ) . they could look up the cases , if necessary . Out of the 100 cases , 83 different cases were read and 35 different cases were actually used by the participants . Following the campaign brief , campaigns organized for alcoholic beverages and campaigns with music as the main theme were among the most frequently read and used cases . the participants also reported the time that they worked with the available support ( in minutes ) , the time needed for completing the task ( in minutes ) , and whether the time allotted to the task was suf - ficient ( on a seven - point scale from 1 = \u201cfar too little\u201d to 7 = \u201cfar too much\u201d ) . these process data are presented in table 4 . Why did remote cases not enhance novelty ? the first two rows of table 4 show that participants in Study 2 ( close versus remote cases ) read , on average , about the same number of cases ( M = 4 . 3 versus M = 4 . 6 , p = 0 . 668 ) . however , table 4 also reveals that participants in the \u201cremote cases\u201d condition , on average , used fewer cases than participants in the \u201cclose cases\u201d condition ( M = 0 . 60 versus M = 1 . 25 , p = 0 . 043 ) .

In these conditions , participants read and used significantly more close cases than remote cases ( M = 2 . 35 versus M = 0 . 95 , p = 0 . 004 for \u201ccases read\u201d ; M = 0 . 85 versus M = 0 . 10 , p = 0 . 005 for \u201ccases used\u201d ) . thus , there appears to be a ( cognitive ) hurdle for using remote cases . to enhance novelty via a deeper exploration of the solution space , rietzschel et al . [ 63 ] argued that a certain degree of homogeneity of the provided stimuli is neces - sary . the cases provided by the CBr system loaded with remote cases ( containing cases for a wide variety of product categories ) are arguably more heterogeneous than the cases provided by the CBr system loaded with close cases ( containing only consumer - packaged goods cases ) , which may thus have inhibited a deeper explora - tion of the solution space . Nonetheless , a CBr system filled with remote cases should still be able to stimulate a broader exploration of the solution space , but apparently it failed to do so in our study . A possible explanation could be that participants had difficulty seeing the relevance of the retrieved remote cases for solving the problem at hand , as it involves the identification of similarities at a higher level of abstraction than for close cases and thus requires more effort . this is illustrated by the fact that the participants in the \u201cremote cases\u201d condition used fewer cases but , at the same time , they tended to take more time to come up with a solution than the participants in the \u201cclose cases\u201d condition ( M = 132 . 8 versus M = 115 . 5 , p = 0 . 058 ) . Interestingly , a number of participants who had the choice between close and remote cases managed to overcome this hurdle and actually used remote cases . When the pro - portion of \u201cremote cases used\u201d is included as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis of Study 3 , we find a positive relationship with novelty ( \u03b2 = 0 . 33 , p = 0 . 050 ) ( note that the inclusion of this variable did not substantially alter the coefficients shown in table 3 ) . Also , the solution with the highest overall creativity score ( 7 . 31 ) was actually produced by a participant ( with an average creative ability ) who used a remote case . hence , we should not discard remote cases too quickly . the challenge is to get people to use remote cases , but using a system loaded with remote cases only proved largely ineffective . A comparison of the right - hand side of Figure 1 ( mix of close and remote cases ) with Figure 2 ( either close cases or remote cases ) suggests that providing a mix of close and remote cases is more effective . Why did a CBr system not help highly creative individuals ? highly creative indi - viduals are said to be high on self - sufficiency [ 14 ] , so they may have ignored the CBr system . this is not the case in our studies . highly creative individuals did not differ in terms of the number of cases they read and used , the time they worked with the CBr system , and the total time they needed to complete the task . however , there are some significant differences with regard to the use of the CBr system loaded with remote cases only . highly creative individuals used this CBr system much longer than individuals with a low creative ability ( M = 51 . 5 versus M = 20 . 0 , p = 0 . 015 ) . they also used remote cases for constructing a solution to a greater extent than individuals with a low creative ability , who abstained from using them ( M = 0 . 90 versus M = 0 . 00 , p = 0 . 054 ) . the story here is that individuals with a low creative ability tend to dismiss SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 329 remote cases more quickly , while highly creative individuals go the extra mile , but it does not help them to produce more creative solutions . Discussion Implications for research t ABle 5 provides AN overvieW of our fiNdiNgs . Study 1 showed that a CBr system loaded with a diverse set of 100 ( successful ) past cases effectively enhanced the creative performance of individuals with lower creative ability , but it did not help highly creative individuals . Study 2 revealed that the strategy to enhance the novelty of the solutions by loading the CBr system with remote cases only was largely ineffective . the process data suggest that participants were less inclined to use remote cases , arguably because they had difficulty seeing their relevance and applicability . Nonetheless , when given the choice between close and remote cases , participants who actually used remote cases tended to produce more novel solutions . these findings provide a more nuanced view on the benefits of using remote cases ( or far analogies ) for enhancing novelty , as reported by Dahl and Moreau [ 19 ] , De luca and Atuahene - gima [ 22 ] , Moorman and Miner [ 57 ] , and tiwana and Mclean [ 74 ] . there might be an optimal level of remoteness beyond which the use of remote knowledge becomes counterproductive ( inverted u - shape ) . Study 3 demonstrated that a CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases ( instead of 50 ) proved more effective , but not for highly creative individuals . Although participants , on average , read about four different cases and used only one of these cases for con - structing a solution , storing more cases in the CBr system seems better for enhancing the usefulness and overall creativity of the solutions . We compared only two situations here : 50 versus 100 diverse cases . It would be interesting to investigate whether our findings also apply to larger case bases . For example , would it be worthwhile to cre - ate vast knowledge bases that contain thousands of cases ? Or is there perhaps also an inverse u - shaped relationship with the creativity of the solutions when it comes to the number of cases stored in the CBr system ? the participants in our studies were marketing students . Marketing students are pro - spective brand managers in charge of sales promotion activities and it is not unlikely that , through their student jobs and internships , many of them already had some experi - ence with designing marketing campaigns . Although students have been found to be reasonable substitutes for managers in experimental studies ( e . g . , [ 61 ] ) , it would be interesting to conduct a study with brand managers or employees of marketing agen - cies who arguably possess more practical domain knowledge . Furthermore , participants worked on the task individually , but in practice creativity is often the result of teamwork . Professionals and teams may also be better able to use remote cases . Further research should therefore investigate whether our findings also hold in team settings . We did conduct a pilot study with small teams and found similar positive effects of a CBr system loaded with 100 diverse cases on creativity . In our studies remote cases appeared less effective for enhancing creativity than close cases , which runs counter to the findings of other studies ( e . g . , [ 19 ] ) .

Special attention needs to be paid here to highly creative individuals , whom we expected to be better able to use remote cases and make the necessary mental leaps . however , they did not benefit from the use of a CBr system , and the one loaded with remote cases only appeared even detrimental ( see Figures 1 and 2 ) . Should these people be left alone or are there other techniques that could enhance their performance ? We need to dig deeper into the process and the differences between individuals with a high and low creative ability , so that we can support them with the right type of CSSs . Implications for Practice hiring highly creative individuals is one option to enhance the creative output of an organization [ 3 ] . however , with the help of a CBr system with 100 diverse cases , indi - viduals with a low creative ability were able to match , or even surpass , the performance of highly creative individuals ( see Figure 1 ) . thus , organizations do not necessarily have to rely on creative individuals , as they can easily set up a CBr system and fill it with cases . An organization\u2019s own cases constitute an invaluable source of proprietary domain knowledge . Based on our findings , it seems best to build a sufficiently large case base that contains a mix of close cases and remote cases . A recent example of the approach outlined in this paper is the beer bottle design contest that heineken organized to celebrate its 140th anniversary ( heineken Future Bottle Design Contest 2013 ) . this contest invited people from all over the world to submit a creative design for heineken\u2019s future beer bottle . Participants were explic - itly asked to look for inspiration in the heineken archives , which include 250 items ranging from pictures of previous bottle designs ( close cases ) to pictures of nature and art objects ( remote cases ) , and to \u201cremix\u201d these items into a new bottle design . Participants could also view the designs submitted by other contestants ( as well as the number of views for each submission ) . Conclusions A tteNtioN to the divisioN of Work BetWeeN computers ANd humANs is growing due to ever - increasing computer capabilities . Over the past two decades , CSSs have gained ground as a means to enhance individual , group , and organizational creativity . In three studies , we investigated the effectiveness of a knowledge - based CBr system for enhancing the creativity of sales promotion campaigns . the CBr technology is based on the principle of analogical reasoning and makes relevant domain knowledge available in the form of cases . Because analogical reasoning and the provision of SuPPOrtINg CrEAtIVE PrOBlEM SOlVINg WIth A CASE - BASED rEASONINg SyStEM 333 domain knowledge have been argued to be conducive to creativity , we investigated whether the use of a CBr system enhances creativity and under what conditions . these conditions pertained to the creative ability of the individual and two system design characteristics , namely the type and number of cases stored in the CBr system . Our findings have the following implications for CSSs and creative cognition theory : ( 1 ) when considering the effectiveness of CSSs it is important to take into account the creative ability of the individual ( i . e . , \u201cone size does not fit all\u201d ) , ( 2 ) making a sufficiently large and diverse set of cases available is better for stimulating creativity , and ( 3 ) providing cases that are too remote may be counterproductive . Organizations seeking to redesign their division of labor between individuals and machines can easily follow the CBr approach presented in this paper , using their own set of cases , in order to boost the creativity of individuals with lower creative ability . there are many examples of creative design problems in business that are comparable to the problem of designing sales promotion campaigns , such as the design of advertising campaigns , new products , packaging , logos , or even strategic plans . Such weakly structured problems , for which cases of previous problem - solving episodes are available , may benefit greatly from collecting , indexing , and storing cases in a CBr system and putting them into action for creative problem solving . however , organizations with highly creative employees , such as advertis - ing agencies , are not likely to benefit much from making a CBr system available to their employees .

For this type of application , a nearest - neighbor algorithm is typically deployed ( using , for instance , the Euclidian distance metric ) [ 45 ] .

We used a triangular null distribution to correct for a central tendency bias [ 49 ] . the r wg index ranges from 0 ( = no agreement ) to 1 . 0 ( = full agreement ) . 6 . to assess the predictive or criterion - related validity of the creative ability test ( AttA ) , we calculated the validity coefficient between the creative ability of the individual and the overall creativity of the solutions in the no CBr system condition , which was a high 0 . 64 ( p = . 001 ) ( see also [ 3 , 4 ] ) . 334 AlthuIzEN AND WIErENgA r efereNces 1 .

Appendix A : Example of a Close Case Stored in the CBr System i N the eArly 1990 s , coNsumers Were BecomiNg less ANd less loyAl . hence , promo - tions were increasingly important to persuade customers to switch brands , stimulate repeat purchases , and increase ( behavioral ) loyalty . A few beer brands offered deep price discounts , sacrificing profit margins . Amstel beer\u2014produced by heineken\u2014 developed a promotion inspired by the popular game \u201cBingo . \u201d underneath the crown cap of Amstel beer bottles , the consumer could find a number , which had to be put on a bingo card . If the consumer had a full card ( \u201cBingo\u201d ) , he or she could win 454 euros . however , the consumer also had to come up with a slogan . the best slogans were rewarded with 450 euros . In total , the prize money was 113 , 445 euros . In a period of nine weeks , Amstel received a total of 240 , 000 complete Bingo cards . results after nine weeks ( three rounds of three weeks ) : increased traffic in stores , increased sales , Amstel\u2019s market share rose 6 . 4 percent ( to 27 percent ) . the campaign was supported by brochures ( at retail outlets ) , television and radio commercials , outdoor advertise - ments , regular advertisements , point of sales material , and crate covers .

  "ackermanOrganizationalMemoryObjects2004": "Organizational Memory as Objects , Processes , and Trajectories : An Examination of Organizational Memory in Use MARK S . ACKERMAN 1 & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 2 1 School of Information and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI 48104 , USA ( E - mail : ackerm @ umich . edu ) ; 2 Social Computing Group , IBM Research , 650 Harry Rd , D2 - 252 , San Jose , CA 95120 , USA ( E - mail : krys @ us . ibm . com ) Abstract . For proper knowledge management , organizations must consider how knowledge is kept and reused . The term organizational memory is due for an overhaul . Memory appears to be everywhere in organizations ; yet , the term has been limited to only a few uses . Based on an ethnographic study of a telephone hotline group , this paper presents a micro - level , distributed cognition analysis of two hotline calls , the work activity surrounding the calls , and the memory used in the work activity . Drawing on the work of Star , Hutchins , and Strauss , the paper focuses on issues of applying past information for current use . Our work extends Strauss\u2019 and Hutchins\u2019 trajectories to get at the understanding of potential future use by participants and its role in current information storage . We also note the simultaneously shared provenance and governance of multiple memories \u2013 human and technical . This analysis and the theoretical framework we construct should be to be useful in further e\ufb00orts in describing and analyzing organizational memory within the context of knowledge manage - ment e\ufb00orts . Key words : boundary objects , collective memory , contextualization , corporate memory , dis - tributed cognition , information reuse , knowledge management , memory reuse , organizational memory , trajectories of information 1 . Introduction Central to knowledge management e\ufb00orts is reuse \u2013 of explicit information , tacit knowledge , or lessons learned \u2013 within an organization . Intuitively , the reuse of previously stored information , or organizational memory , is critical to the success of modern organizations . Yet much remains unanswered about organizational memory . We know relatively little about , for example : \u2022 How do organizations , as collectivities of people , remember and forget ? \u2022 Where do knowledge - based organizations store information to be re - used ? What does it even mean for an organization to \u2018\u2018store\u2019\u2019 informa - tion ? How are people part of that \u2018\u2018stored\u2019\u2019 information ? \u2022 How are memories accrued , located , and then used ? \u2022 How is information abandoned ?

If CSCW as a research area wishes to construct organizational memory systems as part of knowledge management in the context of organizational life , developing the ability to theorize at an appropriate level ( Strauss , 1991 ) will be required to guide e\ufb00orts . Theoretical conceptions of organizational memory , however , are due for an overhaul . The term organizational mem - ory has been unnecessarily restricted to only a few uses centered around particular technologies ; yet , memory appears to be everywhere in organiza - tions . Accordingly , we wish to step back in this paper and reexamine organi - zational memory to \ufb01nd suitable underlying theoretical constructions . 1 Our intent is not ( yet ) to create technological organizational memory systems . Instead our goal is to examine and to understand where memory exists within an organizational setting . The major portion of this paper consists of a detailed analysis of two hotline calls , progressively describing each call and the work activity sur - rounding the call . We found our \ufb01eld site , a telephone helpline for personnel issues , a particularly useful domain for studying organizational memory ; largely because the repetition of questions and answers facilitated our observation and recognition of particular patterns . A descriptive examina - tion , rooted in an organizational \ufb01eld study , that allows both a micro - scale analysis along with a theoretical development is most likely to be useful to later system construction . Accordingly , we necessarily have restricted our examination to a very small scale of operation because of the detail required . We approach this examination from distributed cognition theory ( Rogers , 1992 ; Halverson , 1995 ; Hutchins , 1995 ) , described below , because its theo - retical language spans the diverse manifestations of organizational memory \u2013 from private to public and small scale to large . The paper begins with a brief synopsis of the organizational memory literature and its need for empirically - based analyses of organizational memory . The next sections provide a brief introduction to distributed cog - nition theory . We follow this with a description of our \ufb01eld site and ethno - graphic data collection . As mentioned , the majority of the paper is an explication of two hotline calls along with the construction of an appropriate set of theoretical concepts . As with most ethnographically - based studies , the explication of the data and the \ufb01ndings are interwoven in the paper . The paper concludes with general implications for organizational memory re - search and a look at future research directions . 2 . Organizational memory Organizational memory , while it serves as an entry point for considerations of knowledge management has many varying , and occasionally competing , MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 156 de\ufb01nitions in the literature . As will be seen below , few of the literature\u2019s de\ufb01nitions and conjectures , to date , rest on empirical examinations of organizational memory within a context of use . There have been repeated calls for empirical studies . 2 Walsh and Ungson ( 1991 ) , for example , note that : Despite the general use of the term organizational memory , it is not clear that we have understood the concept or its implications for the manage - ment of organizations . To date , a myriad of unexamined conjectures has de\ufb01ned a concept that has even served as a basis for prescriptive management advice . ( pp . 84 \u2013 85 ) Studies of organizational memory fall into three groups . The \ufb01rst are theo - retical studies , providing a general description of memory at the organiza - tional level . Generally , papers theorizing about organizational memory also theorize at a very grand scale , not relying on empirical data . They are often founded on a March and Simon model of organizations as information processors using search ( March and Simon , 1958 ) . For example , Stein and Zwass ( 1995 ) argued that the organization uses its mnemonic functions to attain its goals ; no detailed examination of how this is accomplished was provided . Huber ( 1990 ) argues that organizational learning and memory support would be useful , but the paper does not distinguish clearly what constitutes organizational memory . Smith ( 1994 ) uses a similar model . At a similar level , Sandoe and Olfman ( 1992 ) examined how remembering and forgetting might be useful organizational mechanisms , and Jennex and Olf - man ( 2002 ) investigated the e\ufb03cacy of organizational memory systems . The second set of organizational memory studies has examined the use of particular computer systems designed to augment an organization\u2019s memory . Most such studies have largely focused on the technology systems designed to replace human and paper - based memory systems . For example , Ackerman studied the Answer Garden system in a series of technical studies ( Ackerman and Malone , 1990 ; Ackerman , 1993 ) and \ufb01eld studies ( Ackerman , 1996 ) . Answer Garden attempted to \u2018\u2018grow\u2019\u2019 an organizational memory by pro - viding a way to augment an information database and help facility . As users asked questions about their work or other tasks , the experts who answered them could add the questions and their answers to the information database , thus growing the organizational memory in a manner useful to the organi - zational members . A redesign of Answer Garden , based on additional case studies of information seeking ( Ackerman and Palen , 1996 ) , was reported in Ackerman and McDonald ( 1996 ) and Ackerman and Starr ( 1996 ) . Similarly , Conklin examined the use of his Corporate Memory design rationale system in Conklin and Begeman ( 1988 ) and Conklin ( 1992 ) . Morrison and Weiser in a series of papers ( Morrison , 1993 ; Morrison and Weiser , 1996 ) examined the use of a project memory system called Team - EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 157 Memory , and Mandviwalla et al . ( 1995 ) studied collaborative writing as a form of organizational memory . Other systems , such as Grassroots ( Kamiya et al . , 1996 ) , have also been built and are being studied . Commercially , Lotus Notes has been a successful technology for constructing organizational knowledge , and Intranet uses of the World Wide Web are now heavily de - ployed . Recently , Robinson et al . ( 2000 ) examined the use of a work \u2018\u2018diary\u2019\u2019 in a factory setting ( a paper mill ) . They uncovered the use of asynchronous \u2018\u2018remark - aloud\u2019\u2019 behavior , similar to that on a trading \ufb02oor or communica - tion facility , where one worker remarks on a problem or issue for later use . These studies of speci\ufb01c systems have been limited . They often rely on narrow de\ufb01nitions of organizational memory or organizational tasks . More importantly , examining particular systems , often prototypes , brings a con - comitant di\ufb03culty in theoretical generalization . The third set of organizational memory studies examines the use of organizational memory through \ufb01ne - grained , \ufb01eld - based empirical studies . Although these would be the most useful for both designing systems and for understanding the nuances of practice , relatively few such studies exist . In one study , Hughes and King ( 1992 ) examined the use of paperwork in an accounting o\ufb03ce . They found that the organizational members used paper - work to account for the work accomplished so far . Other studies of paper artifacts have found similar uses for paper . Sacks ( 1994 ) , in an organizational ethnography , examined organizational learning among software engineers ; he found that his study participants learned from other engineers , not the code itself . Orlikowski ( 1992 ) noted the importance of incentives for infor - mation reuse in her Lotus Notes \ufb01eld site . Many studies ( e . g . , Suchman and Wynn , 1984 ; Cicourel , 1990 ; Bannon and B\u00f8dker , 1997 ; Constant et al . , 1994 ) echo these \ufb01ndings ; they suggest that use of information is extremely nuanced , exception handling is the norm , and social arrangements are criti - cal . Despite these foundational studies , there has been little follow - on to the carefully detailed , \ufb01eld - based , empirically - grounded analyses upon which to base either theory or system design . In this paper we focus on theoretical development based on such an analysis . We agree with Bannon and Kuutti ( 1996 ) that despite the conceptual problems , there is something arresting about the idea that an organization can remember . They state : . . . that such a concept is appealed to across a wide range of studies , even if its de\ufb01nition is disputed , is testimony to the fact that even if people cannot agree on what exactly the term means , there must be some set of issues that can be subsumed under its umbrella that people feel are important and worth discussing . ( pp . 156 \u2013 157 ) The relative dearth of empirical examinations speci\ufb01cally about organiza - tional memory is unfortunate . The need for systematic work to examine MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 158 organizational memory is even more pressing than for many other organi - zational concepts . Organizational memory as a concept lends itself to a number of theoretical problems . Relying on an mistaken characterization of how individual memory works propagates the disservice when applied to groups and organizations . Organizations are hardly a single , uni\ufb01ed entity , as the metaphor implies , nor is their memory . Furthermore , organizational memory , as a collective function , must also be socially constructed , main - tained , and driven . Organizational memory as a theoretical concept , then , should be groun - ded in studies within organizational \ufb01eld settings ; that is , within a context of everyday use . With such a basis , system construction can be instituted upon these empirically - determined insights \u2013 instead of just building systems blindly . Indeed , others ( Hughes et al . , 1995 ; Bannon and Kuutti , 1996 ) have strongly argued that more empirical \ufb01eld - based studies are required to understand organizational memory . In the next section we introduce distributed cognition theory , explain why we think it is useful , and outline how to go about an analysis that includes tasks , individuals , technologies , and social arrangements . 3 . Distributed cognition theory and analysis Organizational memory is a messy problem . Instead of clear - cut mechanisms making it easy to map the real world to some theoretical expectations we see contradictions or border cases in any carefully detailed \ufb01eld study . To \ufb01nd a deeply grounded theoretical coherence , we needed come to terms with all the convergent and divergent observations . When we \ufb01rst began looking at this data , we were struck by similarities with Halverson\u2019s work with air tra\ufb03c controllers ( Halverson , 1995 ) and Hutchins\u2019 work with large ship navigation ( Hutchins , 1995 ) . These similarities , coupled with the obvious cognitive as - pects of talking about memory , led us to look at Hutchins\u2019 distributed cog - nition theory for our analysis . Distributed cognition theory ( Hutchins , 1995 ; Hollan et al . , 2000 ) , de - scribed below , has a theoretical language that can span the diverse mani - festations of organizational memory \u2013 from private to public and small scale to large . Both based in , and reacting to , cognitive science\u2019s characterization of cognition as computation , and anthropology\u2019s emphases on culture , dis - tributed cognition theory serves as a useful conceptual framework for the analysis of human organizational systems . To explain why we \ufb01nd this theory so useful for examining organizational memory we will \ufb01rst outline the basic theoretical constructs and then discuss what this means for studying orga - nizational memory . Moving from the theoretical to the practical , we intro - duce the methods , our setting , and outline the scope of the analysis . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 159 3 . 1 . COGNITION IS DISTRIBUTED In the last two decades there has been a growing recognition that removing human behavior from its surrounding environment carries with it as many dangers as advantages . This has been true in a number of \ufb01elds , including CSCW ( Suchman , 1987 ) . Since the mid 1990s there has been a parallel rec - ognition in cognitive science that cognition is more fruitfully viewed as dis - tributed , rather than assuming that it is the property of only an individual mind ( Salomon , 1993 ; Hutchins , 1995 ; Clark , 1997 ) . Several researchers have used the term distributed to mark this di\ufb00erence in perspective from more traditional approaches to cognitive science ( Hutchins , 1991 ; Norman , 1991 ; Cole and Engestro\u00a8m , 1993 ; Salomon , 1993 ; Hutchins and Klausen , 1996 ) . How cognition is distributed varies by the circumstances and the researcher . At the same time there is increasing rec - ognition that societies and organizations have cognitive properties that are di\ufb00erent from those of individuals . We focus on the theory of distributed cognition developed by Hutchins beginning in the mid - 80s , published in his book ( 1995 ) and continuing today ( Hollan et al . , 2000 ) . As a term , distributed cognition refers to the perspective that cognition occurs in a distributed manner . Distributed cognition theory is concerned with the organization and operation of cognitive systems ; that is , with the mechanisms that make up cognitive processes , which result in cognitive accomplishments . Furthermore , it re - situates cognition in the socio - cultural context . As Hutchins ( 1995 ) points out there were many costs when cognitive science set aside history , culture , context and emotion from the study of cognition . One mistakes the properties of the system for those of the indi - vidual , putting too much focus on the boundary between the individual and everything else . In turn \u2018\u2018when one commits to the notion that all intelligence is inside the inside / outside boundary , one is forced to cram inside everything that is required to produce the observed behaviors\u2019\u2019 ( p . 355 ) . Instead dis - tributed cognition takes the position that \u2018\u2018a process is not cognitive simply because it happens in a brain , nor is a process non - cognitive simply because it happens in the interactions among many brains . \u2019\u2019 ( Hollan et al . , 2000 , p . 175 ) This opens up our notions of cognitive processes to a much wider variety of mechanisms than classic symbol manipulation ( Newell and Simon , 1972 ; Simon , 1990 ) . This is one of the two key theoretical commitments that de\ufb01ne distributed cognition . A second and related tenant of distributed cognition is its commitment to a unit of analysis de\ufb01ned in relation to the complex phenomena being ob - served . In Cognition in the Wild ( Hutchins , 1995 ) , Hutchins shows the information processing in a navigation team varies with the context and circumstances . Solo watch standing involves one individual in structured MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 160 interaction with various artifacts via well - established procedures and rou - tines . In contrast , entering a harbor is a high - tempo activity that requires the e\ufb00ort of several people coordinating with specialized tools and each other . While the overall functional behavior exhibited by the system is the same , that is safe navigation of the ship , the means change . The power of these two tenets , taken together , is extremely useful for studying how organizational memory really happens in organizations . Dis - tributed cognition gives us a way to approach the processes concerned with information use , while still considering that the speci\ufb01cs of how information is represented , and where it is represented , might a\ufb00ect the outcomes of both storing and retrieving information . There are three basic interactions that involve the distribution of cognitive processes and a\ufb00ect the phenomena of organizational memory . These are the distributions of cognitive process ( a ) between internal and external representations , ( b ) through time , and ( c ) across members of a group . In the sections below we discuss each of these . 3 . 1 . 1 . Coordination of cognitive processing between internal and external representational states When the unit of analysis is widened to include other observable cognitive agents we become more aware of how representations are coordinated among agents and across boundaries . Cognitive processing necessarily requires processing that is both internal and external to individuals , as well as some artifacts . For example , Hutchins deeply analyzes the socio - cultural \u2013 technical sys - tem of navigation aboard a large military vessel . Building on Simon\u2019s con - ception that problem solving is re - representing the problem until the solution becomes transparent , Hutchins lays out how the cognitive computation of the system solving the \u2018\u2018problem\u2019\u2019 of navigation can be detailed . As he states : \u2018\u2018The \ufb01x cycle 3 is accomplished by the propagation of representational state across a series of representational media . The representations of the position of the ship take di\ufb00erent forms in the di\ufb00erent media as they make their way from the sighting telescopes of the alidades to the chart . \u2019\u2019 ( Hutchins , 1995 , p . 117 ) That propagation requires the careful coordination of information among individuals and artifacts so that the representational state being propagated is meaningful . 3 . 1 . 2 . Temporally distributed cognitive processes Culture is a process that accumulates partial solutions to frequently encountered problems . ( Hollan et al . , 2000 , p . 178 ) . Cognition is distributed through time in such a way that the products of earlier events transform the nature of later events . Culturally de\ufb01ned EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 161 routines , such as a routine about the \u2018\u2018right way\u2019\u2019 to do something , are examples of this . Artifacts can also embed a history of their use . For example , a ruler is marked with lines that have meaning that a\ufb00ect their current use . Saying that a piece of paper is 8\u00bd by 11 in . assumes that the measurement , as well as the number system is meaningful to both the speaker and the hearer . That meaning is based on their previous use and the history of how those markers came to have meaning with respect to socially agreed measurements . The artifact of the ruler then serves as a way to save and carry forward a solution to the problem of measurement . In some cases the solu - tion is more speci\ufb01c , for example , in the specialized artifacts for navigation , such as the Mercator projection ( Hutchins , 1995 ) , which helps solve certain kinds of navigation problems . Both the ruler and the map show one way that artifacts , which save and carry forward a partial solution , can a\ufb00ect the process of an event far re - moved in time . To be successful however , such artifacts are knit together with the mechanisms of current social practice . In the case of a well - de\ufb01ned problem like navigation , where the parameters that are important have been well understood for over a century , the social practice has been routinized and carried forward with the artifact . Thus , contextualizing the artifact ( which is necessary for its use ) has been carried forward with it in time . One possible inference is that this embedding of solutions in artifacts and their accompanying practice is only possible where systems are usually solving repetitive well - de\ufb01ned problems such as ship navigation ( Hutchins , 1988 , 1995 ) , and aviation ( Hutchins , 1995 ; Hutchins and Klausen , 1996 ) . Such problems are often complicated but well structured . In addition , the repetition means that the high cost of proceduralizing and embedding the solution in an artifact is well worth the e\ufb00ort . However , these kinds of solutions also happen on a local scale , as Halverson observed in air tra\ufb03c control ( Halverson , 1995 ; Halverson and Ackerman , 2003 ) . One easily rec - ognizable example is so - called cheat sheets , such as the phone list of a work group or notes on how to back up \ufb01les to a shared \ufb01le system . In these cases the problem to be solved is repetitive and well - de\ufb01ned within a very localized setting ( perhaps only one individual ) and over a comparatively short time span . 3 . 1 . 3 . Socially distributed cognition The application of these abilities must be \u2018\u2018organized\u2019\u2019 in the sense that the work done by each component ability must be coordinated with that done by others . ( Hutchins , 1995 , p . 154 ) Cognitive processing can be distributed across members of a group as well . If artifacts act as repositories , encoding partial solutions to problems , then how MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 162 might the cognitive properties of a group di\ufb00er from those of an individual ? Hutchins points out that since Durkheim at the turn of the last century there have been largely programmatic assertions that groups might have cognitive properties di\ufb00ering from those of an individual . Roberts ( 1964 ) began to demonstrate how such properties might be manifested at the individual and group levels . Roberts suggested , as Hutchins notes , \u2018\u2018that a cultural group can be seen as a kind of widely distributed memory . Such a memory is clearly more robust than the memory of any individual and undoubtedly has a much greater capacity . \u2019\u2019 ( Hutchins , 1995 , p . 177 ) Roberts studied four American Indian tribes and compared their ability at information retrieval at the tribal level , linking the observed properties to particular features of group orga - nization . Hutchins builds on this by discussing how both communication and learning processes di\ufb00er between individuals and groups involved with the navigation of a ship . Hutchins argues that di\ufb00erent social organizations help a system solve di\ufb00erent sorts of problems . Furthermore , the organization , for example of the team and artifacts used to navigate , can change in response to the changing needs of the system . Thus , while existing social structure may proscribe the path of certain processes it does not restrict potential paths completely . The \u2018\u2018cognitive accomplishments of any two groups might de - pend entirely on di\ufb00erences in the social organization of distributed cognition and not at all on di\ufb00erences in the cognitive properties of individuals in the two groups . \u2019\u2019 Hutchins explores this further by investigating the di\ufb00erence between learning at an individual and organizational level . Our observations resonated with many of Hutchins\u2019 \ufb01ndings . As we dis - cuss below , organizational memory is necessarily distributed through time and across not only group members , but groups . In addition , a distributed cognition analysis exposes the coordination necessary between representa - tional states that we found critical for day - to - day operations . 3 . 2 . METHODS FOR DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS It is one thing to talk about observing the coordination of representational media , but what does that mean in terms of data collection and analysis ? In this section , we discuss how the theoretical stance a\ufb00ects both methods and analysis . 3 . 2 . 1 . Analysis To begin , distributed cognition theory frames the problem in terms of examining a cognitive system in terms of its functions . The \ufb01rst task in a distributed cognition analysis is to identify how a functional system works , good and bad ( Rogers , 1992 ) . There are low - level functional systems often EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 163 embedded in larger functional systems that contribute to the overall activity being observed . Functional operation is decomposed into smaller units of analysis that make sense with respect to the particular system . While appearing in some cases to be straightforward task decomposition , it is more essentially an event driven segmentation . As with other cognitive theories , distributed cognition identi\ufb01es the ob - served informational inputs entering , as well as those outputs leaving , a system . The functional de\ufb01nition of the unit of analysis helps with this identi\ufb01cation . Stepping down in grain size , inside the system the focus is about how information is represented , and how these representations are transformed , combined , and propagated through that system in order to produce the system\u2019s observable behavior ( Simon , 1990 ) . It is the detailing of representational states and processes that helps the analyst to understand much of the system processing as it involves transitions between humans and artifacts . One records the representational state , the material media on which it is instantiated , as well as the processes that transform it . Video recording is particularly helpful here because of the ability to review the record repeti - tively and glean details that are observable but di\ufb03cult to catch in just \u2018\u2018one - pass\u2019\u2019 . Thinking of organizations as cognitive systems is not new , of course . What is new is the examination of the role of the material media in which representations are embodied , and in the physical processes that propagate representations across media . Applying the cognitive science approach to a larger unit of analysis requires attention to the details of these processes as they are enacted in the activities of real persons interacting with real material media . ( Hutchins , 1995 , p . 266 ) The common breakdown into representational states and processes provides a way to analyze how the observed details achieve the particular function that is the focus of a unit of analysis . This presents artifacts , human actors , and organizational and social structures on an equal theoretical footing . With a description constructed in these terms we can begin to understand how technologies and social structures currently \ufb01t a system\u2019s operation . Once analyzed into its component representational states and processes , the analyst uses that information to reconstruct the functioning of the sys - tem . This allows an analysis with respect to the context of use within an organization . By extension one can speculate about how changes in tech - nologies might a\ufb00ect future operations . We believe that looking at the phe - nomena of organizational memory is well supported by taking this essentially cognitive view of a system , and in our interpretation , giving it a certain social twist . However , before discussing how distributed cognition can be applied to a speci\ufb01c organizational memory , we must \ufb01rst present the details of the \ufb01eld setting . MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 164 4 . Setting and data collection This study is based on \ufb01eld observations of a telephone hotline group ( called HLG here ) at a well - established company , CyberCorp , headquartered in Silicon Valley . HLG answers human resource questions for CyberCorp , primarily about bene\ufb01ts and personnel policies for the company\u2019s thousands of employees . In general , telephone hotlines are of interest in the study of organizational memory , largely because they are so information intensive . HLG agents have to start forming their answer within 45 \u2013 60 s while simul - taneously listening to the caller\u2019s elaborations and information . Many an - swers came directly from the hotline member\u2019s memory ; hotline questions tend to be repetitive . There is also a great need for additional information sources : Facts must be double - checked , new questions arise , and answers become obsolete with new conditions . The \ufb01eld study took place over a period of 18 months . A variety of data collection methods were used , including direct observation , video , semi - structured interviews , and social network analyses . Here we describe and analyze the responses to two calls captured on video . Both calls involve Joan 4 . Joan was an experienced agent , having been at CyberCorp for \ufb01ve years and at HLG for one year . Because of privacy reasons , only one side of the conversations was taped . Joan , however , described each call fully to the camera . ( Moreover , we are concerned here with Joan\u2019s actions , rather than the intent of the caller . ) Throughout , Joan appeared to be natural and relaxed . Joan and the other agents work in cubicles that are open to a central corridor ( Figure 1 ) . Like many control room settings ( e . g . Seifert and Hutchins , 1992 ) , the cubicles are close enough to easily hear the activities of other agents . Her chair faces away from the corridor between the cubicles . This arrangement is important for accomplishing her work . Each agent has two monitors , where she uses a number of software packages . The telephone to the right of her monitors is another computa - tional system that plays a role in the work . These computational systems and software will be discussed at length below . Shared systems Joan Figure 1 . Joan\u2019s workplace . The left - hand portion shows how the cubicles are related to each other , as well as the shared terminals . The right is a larger picture of Joan\u2019s o\ufb03ce . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 165 4 . 1 . APPLYING DISTRIBUTED COGNITION TO HLG Like other functional human systems , HLG has the property that many of the system properties are directly observable . We can bound the portion of the system to be analyzed , based on the observed function and initially its temporal limits . Within this unit , we expose information about the task , its resources , and organization . In the case of HLG , the cognitive system\u2019s purpose is to answer or solve the caller\u2019s problem . The caller can be seen as the input to this system , and her question is a representational state traveling via the material media of the phone to one of the HLG agents . For each call the unit of consideration may vary . We might initially bound the system to include the caller , Joan , the telephone , and other materials ( or resources ) available to Joan . While her use of the telephone is an indicator of where the process is occurring , it does not completely de\ufb01ne the limits of the task . In general , physical , resource , and temporal limits bound the functional system observed at any point in time . In the analyses that follow some calls are bounded temporally from when the receiver is picked up to when it is set down , a matter of a few minutes . In other cases , the temporal extent is considerably longer but the extent is framed by the focus on the solution of a single problem . In the case of HLG , a distributed cognition analysis highlights how the work of the system is organized and reorganized to meet changing needs . A plethora of information is available in HLG . In some cases the required information is easily accessible , while in others it must be located or uncovered . In any case , information must be monitored , managed , and communicated in order to do the job . The details of this information use form the basis for our description and analysis . In the remainder of the paper we will present the results of the analysis . We present the analysis of two HLG telephone calls . ( We observed at least 300 calls , taped approximately 60 , and chose 10 for analysis in a manner similar to Hutchins and Palen ( 1993 ) and Halverson ( 1995 ) . ) Both of the calls presented here are necessarily simple . Space limitations prevent us from presenting longer calls , but more importantly , even simple calls turn out to be surprisingly complex and rich when fully analyzed . Indeed , we selected these speci\ufb01c calls to best show the organization and function of organizational memory , as these simple calls are easier to explain but still involve the same underlying issues . 5 . Correcting a database entry Below is a transcript from videotape of an HLG call . A walkthrough of this call will begin to unpack the working of organizational memory . We reproduce and discuss the beginning of this call at length ; later , we will summarize sections of the call to be more concise . Because of privacy rea - sons , only one side of the exchange was taped . MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 166 5 . 1 . ANSWERING THE PHONE The \ufb01rst four turns of the call are routine , but even so they demonstrate critical aspects of the organization\u2019s memory . The call begins with a routine set of conversational markers , Joan\u2019s standard opening ( Drew and Heritage , 1992 ) . Turn 1 consists of Joan greeting the caller , and acknowledging that the caller was forced to hold for some period of time . While the telephone system automatically routed a call to her as soon as she \ufb01nished the previous call , the caller was forced to wait for an available agent . Turn 2 acknowledges the caller\u2019s request . In this case an employee has called because a bene\ufb01ts pro - vider does not show her as receiving their bene\ufb01t . This bene\ufb01ts provider , Eye and Vision Associates ( EVA ) , will not process the employee\u2019s claim ( or ra - ther , allow the employee to purchase eyeglasses at a discount ) until this is corrected . The employee says that she called EVA directly and that EVA did not show her as having coverage . Joan must then check whether the employee , Michelle , actually showed coverage within the CARL database : This database , built from payroll data , shows the employee bene\ufb01ts for each employee in CyberCorp . At the end of turn 2 , Joan starts a new call - tracking record in the CAT ( CAll Tracking ) system for the new call , closing out the old one that she had not quite \ufb01nished . Turn 3 is more complex , as Joan does several things simultaneously . She asks for the relevant information , namely the caller\u2019s employee number . Joan has now opened a new CAT record for the call and checked the employee phone list for the caller . She double - checks the em - ployee\u2019s social security number for later use with the CARL database . As she is con\ufb01rming the employee information with the caller , Michelle , she is also typing the information into the call - tracking record . She also writes Michelle\u2019s social security number on a piece of scrap paper , because she must go to the CARL terminal to look up the employee data . When she is \ufb01nished obtaining and double - checking this information , she asks Michelle to hold , knowing that the next step will take a minute or two . 1 HR Helpline . This is Joan . Thanks for holding . ( Joan nods slowly to herself . ) 2 You called EVA directly ? I\u2019ll \ufb01nd out what our system shows for you . Oh I see . Oh , so right , right . . . yeah . . . . ( Encouragingly ) Let me do this . ( In an aside tone ) The system is being very slow , so it\u2019ll take a second to get a new record up for you . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 167 At the end of turn 4 , Joan goes to the CARL terminal , which is physically in another location behind her cubicle . ( There are separate terminals for two di\ufb00erent employee databases , and part of Joan\u2019s routine is selecting the correct database . ) She types , looking at the piece of scrap paper , and pulls up the appropriate record . This takes 23 s . After obtaining the data , she visibly pauses and stares abstractedly at the ceiling . 5 . 2 . MANY SMALL MEMORIES We will proceed with the rest of the call below , but even the \ufb01rst four turns show many cognitive , social , and institutional arrangements in the organi - zation\u2019s memory . In her execution Joan uses not one monolithic memory , as many technocentric models would have it . Instead , she uses many small memories . To reframe , the call was triggered by the telephone system\u2019s short - term memory of the group\u2019s activity . The system state shows that Joan\u2019s station is free , and the call falls to her . Hearing the caller\u2019s information , Joan uses her own memory as she then types that information into the CAT record . ( For convenience , other uses of Joan\u2019s memory are omitted here . ) Joan then takes the information in CAT and reproduces it onto a piece of paper , creating a mobile form of memory . She appears not trust to her own memory , but resorts to something that can help her reconstruct the cir - cumstances of the call . She then types the information from the paper into the CARL system . CARL is a typical type of organizational memory , a corporate database with employee records . Joan places the CARL output onto the paper again . Within just these three turns , Joan has used three separate software sys - tems ( CAT , the telephone system , and CARL ) , her own memory , and scratch paper , all of which maintain representational state for Joan , the group , or both . Figure 2 below graphically displays the order of processing of those memories ; it consists largely of transferring information from memory to 3 I\u2019m sorry . Oh what a shame . Well you know , these funny things . ( More o\ufb03cially ) What is your employee number ? 4 Okay , what I\u2019m going to do is , I\u2019m going to check the , uh , the CARL . Is this Michelle ? Let me check your social security number is the one I have , 1 - 8 - 2 - 4 - zero - 7 - 3 - 5 - 5 . Okay , what I\u2019m going to do is to check the system and \ufb01nd out what your coverage is , and if it\u2019s not showing . . . coverage on CARL , uh , then we\u2019ll , hmm , we\u2019ll have to do something else , okay ? Hold just a second , Michelle MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 168 memory in order to answer the query . Within what is so far a very structured process , Joan\u2019s cognitive work consists largely in knowing which memories to trigger . Little processing has been done on the actual information . Although in Figure 2 we present the trajectory that representational states take through various memories as an individual process , there are actually multiple group and organizational processes occurring . In distributed cog - nition theory , expanding the boundaries of the analysis is required as we enlarge the relevant task in order to understand a memory\u2019s use in its full organizational context . This will become clearer at the end of the call , when Joan indexes the call - tracking record and changes the telephone state , but at this point , Joan is already embedded within these processes . For example , Joan uses CAT , the call - tracking system , seemingly as a short - term memory aid . Its major use , however , is to provide other agents with the ability to reconstruct the history of a caller\u2019s problem . In addition to maintaining a history of calls for the group , the CAT program also creates transformed , longer - term memory in the form of statistics , based on the indexing done by the agent ( later ) during her wrap - up period . These statistics are used by management to govern the group\u2019s future behavior , as has been typical in organizations since the late nineteenth century ( Yates , 1989 , 1990 ) . The telephone system , in addition to being a primitive form of group memory that coordinates and paces the HLG agents\u2019 activities , also creates summary statistics for the group and the organization as a whole . To recap , even within these four turns , Joan uses \ufb01ve discrete memories . Sometimes the memory used is individual and private ; sometimes it is group and public . But all of these memories must be used together seamlessly ( or nearly so ) to create an organizational product ( the product being not only the solution to the call but all of the institutional arrangements surrounding it ) . The density and connectedness of memories used as resources in this envi - ronment are remarkable . The call , of course , continues past Joan\u2019s \ufb01nding the employee\u2019s record . Next Joan must determine what to do with the facts she has uncovered . 5 . 3 . HANDLING AN EXCEPTION As mentioned , Joan pulled up Michelle\u2019s record within the CARL database . After this , Joan visibly paused and stared at the ceiling . As will be seen below , Michelle should have EVA coverage according to her CARL record ; telephone Joan ' s short - term CAT record paper CARL paper Figure 2 . The trajectory of representational states through memories in the \ufb01rst 4 turns of Joan\u2019s call . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 169 yet , EVA shows no such coverage . Presumably , Joan is trying to \ufb01gure out what to do about this unusual discrepancy . After \ufb01ve seconds , she begins a conversation with one of the senior tele - phone agents who had been wrapping up her call . In turns 5 through 15 , Joan asks the senior agent , Nichole , how to proceed . Joan appears in turns 5 through 15 to be trying to understand whether to escalate the problem to the bene\ufb01ts group . Organizationally , the HRG is dependent on other groups to handle more complicated or complex situa - tions ; these are called escalations . The senior agent con\ufb01rms that she should escalate , and tells her what information is necessary to properly create the escalation . ( In the following , the angle brackets h i indicate a section of the tape that was indistinct . The slashes \\ / and / \\ indicate overlapping con - versational areas on the tape ; a \u00bc sign indicates that there was no appreciable pause between the two words . ) Nichole tells Joan , then , to escalate the problem to the Bene\ufb01ts group and to obtain from EVA what they need to resolve the problem . Joan walks away from Nichole at the end of this interaction , and returns to her seat . 5 Joan Nikki , can I get your . . . 6 Nichole Uh , huh . ( Nichole nods her head and walks towards Joan . ) 7 Joan If this employee , uh , called EVA and they say they show no coverage for her , but she\u2019s showing , showing active on CARL . She\u2019s has con\ufb01rmed no problems , but what should I do as far as the referral ? 8 Nichole Call , call them [ EVA ] yourself and \ufb01nd out what they want . 9 Joan Okay . 10 Nichole Then escalate it to the < Bene\ufb01ts > . EVA is asking for this information on this < indistinguishable > . ( O\ufb03cial tone , as though acting out a scenario ) We show it as having such - and - such . That way / we \\ 11 Joan \\ Okay . / Okay , / I \\ 12 Nichole \\ can / tell < them > . . . what EVA is looking for . 13 Joan I can tell the employee it\u2019s showing there\u2019s not , shouldn\u2019t be a problem , so = 14 Nichole = we\u2019re trying to \ufb01x it . 15 Joan I\u2019m trying to get a < feel > for it . Thanks , Nik . MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 170 5 . 4 . ORGANIZING THE WORK We showed earlier how Joan\u2019s processing was dependent on many small memories , including her own . However , solving a problem may not be dependent solely on an individual\u2019s cognition and the artifacts ( memory or otherwise ) within the immediate environment . These turns show how Joan\u2019s work is socially organized as well as the role of memory in that organizing . Unlike ship navigation ( Hutchins , 1988 , 1995 ) or air tra\ufb03c control ( Halverson , 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) with their standard operating procedures , HLG has fewer pre - speci\ufb01ed routines . Yet , as Pentland ( 1991 ) observed in his study of a software hotline and as Katzenberg et al . ( 1996 ) observed in hospital situations , the HLG group has developed a set of informal routines that can be combined \ufb02exibly to solve a large range of problems . Indeed , the HLG manager repeatedly mentioned during the study that he was trying to balance \ufb02exible diagnosis and service with transaction e\ufb03ciency . There were numerous minor task reallocations during the study period as the group attempted to juggle the two demands and build their repertoire of small routines . In this case , Joan has a routine to uncover a discrepancy between what an employee wishes to have for bene\ufb01ts and what he or she currently has \u2013 she looks it up . Joan can then explain that discrepancy as well as potential solutions to the employee . The discrepancy , however , between the internal CyberCorp databases and the bene\ufb01t provider\u2019s database is not routine . Joan later demarked the situation as neither usual nor unusual , and as such , one without a given routine . Instead , Joan relies on Nichole . Nichole was considered the \u2018\u2018expert\u2019\u2019 on more obscure situations ; HLG agents would often pose di\ufb03cult questions to Nichole . Like Hutchins\u2019 Navy navigation crew , the HLG is organized such that the more senior agents have served in all simpler positions . ( The HLG roles are less di\ufb00erentiated than are those for shipboard navigation , but the coverage of experts\u2019 knowledge over novices\u2019 tasks is the same . ) In addition , Joan liked asking questions of other agents as a way of obtaining needed information , so this interaction suited her information seeking style . The intent of many organizational memory systems would be to replace Nichole but without losing the supposedly reusable information . Instead , many exceptions may be better serviced by task experts ; as we see here even with this short exchange . The production is divided not only among group members but among groups as well . Relaxing the boundaries of the task shows Joan\u2019s work is also connected organizationally across other group\u2019s processes . There are two larger tasks that are invoked in these turns . First , Joan and HLG are dependent on another organizational group to maintain the database used to verify an employee\u2019s bene\ufb01ts . Considering the EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 171 call more broadly demonstrates the important set of organizing arrange - ments required to imbue and inscribe the memory with authenticity and veracity ( Anderson and Sharrock , 1993 ) . The HLG agent relies on the payroll group for the correctness of the information , when they create and maintain an employee record , which serves as a boundary object ( Star , 1989 ) . Joan knows none of the details of the record\u2019s creation or mainte - nance ; almost all of the context has been lost . She does not know whether there are problems with the employee\u2019s employment or whether there are extenuating circumstances . Indeed , it is assumed that the CARL database is more authoritatively correct than the employee database ( maintained by the accounting department ) , since CARL is more authoritative for deducted bene\ufb01ts . In addition , escalations are problematic organizationally because there is a \ufb01ne line between taking action inappropriately or incorrectly and between wasting the other group\u2019s time . In fact , there was a fair amount of tension between the Bene\ufb01ts group and HLG . HLG felt that Bene\ufb01ts looked down on them for not knowing the Human Resources ( HR ) subject area su\ufb03 - ciently , and HLG agents wished to be regarded as professionals . Indeed , HLG perceived themselves as the future of the HR profession , as did the CyberCorp management . But this was a future unwanted by most of Bene\ufb01ts , since hotline work was perceived by the Bene\ufb01ts professionals as leading to HR deskilling in CyberCorp . Therefore , inappropriate escalations sometimes furthered political tensions . Since escalations were always to some extent problematic , the procedures around them often shifted during the study , thus the need for the question to Nichole . 5 . 5 . PLAYING A HUNCH In the next segment of the call , Joan returns to her chair , reconnects her telephone headset , and begins to speak with Michelle again . Procedurally , all Joan must do is to tell Michelle that she will call EVA and escalate the problem . However , this is derailed by a side discussion over Michelle\u2019s incorrect telephone number . 16 Michelle , when you spoke with the folks at EVA , what , what is it that they said to you ? 17 Okay , because you do in mine . . . . So I don\u2019t know what the situation is . [ Segment of the call deleted ; Joan is dealing with Michelle\u2019s phone number . ] MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 172 In the omitted portion of the transcript , Michelle reports that she cannot seem to correct her telephone number in the employee phone list , even though she has tried many times . She discusses this at some length with Joan , asking her to change it . At \ufb01rst analysis , the incorrect telephone number appeared to be extraneous to this call , but it is an interesting side conver - sation . The employee , having found someone to correct her employee re - cords , now asks Joan to correct her telephone number in all CyberCorp databases . We believe that to Michelle , it appears that she has found the person that is in charge of correcting the appropriate memory , whether it is her telephone number or her bene\ufb01ts status . Joan cannot , because the responsibility for changing something so seemingly mundane as a telephone number lies with another group . In the actual production , there are distinct organizational boundaries to the memories . To the organizational member , however , these boundaries are arbitrary and frustrating . Joan continues with her explanation of the escalating process ( as it needs to be seen by the employee ) . However , this is derailed several times by a side discussion about obtaining an electronic form for EVA . This side discussion triggers o\ufb00 a recollection and hunch in Joan . Finally , Joan ends the call with the employee . Interestingly , Joan has formulated a plan of action that attempts to solve the problem , rather than following Nichole\u2019s advice literally . In this , she uses Nichole\u2019s statements as advice to formulate her own activity , rather than a requirement . 24 Okay , what we\u2019ll do is , I\u2019m going to call EVA ( voice rising in question tone ) directly and \ufb01nd out what the situation is , and , uh , it\u2019s possible they might need some other information that the bene\ufb01ts department can provide for them , but either way , you\u2019ll get a call back from somebody by the end of the day tomorrow and let you know what the status is , uh , go ahead . . . 25 Oh . ( surprised ) I can request a form for you , but the , the thing is if I request the form and for some reason they don\u2019t have coverage for you they\u2019re going to reject it . So what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll do two things . Uh , EVA , did you , did you call the 800 number ? Did you call , did the hotline direct you to that number ? 26 Right 27 Oh , I see . Well , you know what ? I think I remember this happening once before , Michelle , and since my system showed that , that the employee that called was covered , they said , okay , I\u2019ll put that in the system and we\u2019ll go ahead and send the form out . . . so who knows ? Did . . . [ Segment of the call deleted ; Joan and Michelle discuss Michelle\u2019s address for the EVA form . ] EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 173 At the end of her conversation with the employee , Joan turns to the camera and explains the call . In the time that it takes Joan to explain the situation , she pulls up EVA\u2019s telephone number ( using a computerized rolodex program ) and dials the call . In fact , she appears to end her explanation when the call is connected . In the \ufb01nal section of the call , Joan convinces the EVA agent that Michelle is a CyberCorp employee and that she should have EVA bene\ufb01ts . ( This has been compressed for space rea - sons . ) After \ufb01nishing her call with the EVA agent , Joan wraps up by indexing the call in the CAT system and then signaling to the phone system that she is ready for a new call . At the end of the call , one might surmise that Joan now has a new routine , calling EVA directly and getting an employee her bene\ufb01ts . She could assume that this kind of transaction is routine , since the EVA agent treats it as relatively straightforward . However , as Joan says : \u2018\u2018I think I remember this happening once before . \u2019\u2019 There is no reason to suppose that this will not be recreated again from a very hazy human memory . We next turn to a discussion of the call as a whole and its implications for organizational memory . 5 . 6 . CONTEXT VS . CONTEXTUALIZING The term \u2018\u2018context\u2019\u2019 is often used as a catchall to denote the wealth of organizational and cultural knowledge one e\ufb00ortlessly brings to bear in a given situation . Joan shows in this call that she has knowledge of how her world works and that this knowledge is necessary for getting her work done . Within the call , she displays an understanding of her limitations , the range of knowledge within HLG , Nichole\u2019s role , and the complex relationship of HLG to Bene\ufb01ts and to EVA . If one were primarily interested in implementing a technocentric view of organizational memory or knowledge management , with their immediate emphasis on capture and reuse , one might assume that all Joan needs is more information , whether in a computer system or on paper . Instead , the story is more complex . We see Joan moving seamlessly through this real setting with its many process states , using the memories and other artifacts that she judges to be critical to \ufb01nishing her task . To understand her use of memory You don\u2019t [ show her on your system ] ? No . Is it , is it possible for me to , to uh , verify she\u2019s on our ( rising , questioning ) system ? And you can go ahead and send the form to her ? Excellent . I have an address ( rising , questioning ) , if that would help you ? MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 174 resources in accomplishing this , however , it will be important to tease apart the concurrent use of contextualization , decontextualization , and recontex - tualization in obtaining a solution to the situation . We do this more fully in the second call . 5 . 7 . THE MISSING BARK The need for context , and Joan\u2019s contextualization of the environment , is revealed in the order and access of various resources . As with Sherlock Holmes\u2019 famous hound ( which remained silent while the supposed crime was being committed ) , the interesting thing about this call is all of the things that did not happen . Joan did not stumble or falter , searching for her next step . She needed help in the face of a breakdown , but she carefully and quickly determined a resolution . In her selections , she showed an enormous under - standing of her environment and the role of artifacts and people within it . On the other hand , Joan did not use paper or on - line documents to for - mulate her plan of action for this situation . The key was not that detail was missing from the on - line sources . If this were so , the solution would be indeed to add even more information on - line . To the contrary , the key to Joan\u2019s lack of use is the overwhelming amount of detail available . Since an HLG agent must have an answer within 45 \u2013 60 s , it is impossible to sift through mega - bytes of information . A search with terms \u2018\u2018EVA\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018enrollment\u2019\u2019 might turn up dozens of documents . Even if the retrieval is ranked ( i . e . , the search engine evaluates the likelihood of \ufb01t ) , the agent does not have the time to consider the retrieved materials . The information use that does occur is situated ( Suchman , 1987 ) . Joan does not view all sources equally . She went to Nichole , rather than to another agent . She avoided one database for another . Despite Nichole\u2019s advice , she relied on her own memory . Like the other agents , Joan considers some sources as authoritative . Sources have di\ufb00erent costs , psychological or \ufb01nancial , associated with their access . She selects and chooses resources in her environment , according to her immediate understanding of the situation . Importantly , the caller , Michelle , does not need to know the space within Joan is operating . All she needs is her problem solved . 5 . 8 . MEMORIES AS BOUNDARY OBJECTS In a distributed cognition view , an organization\u2019s memory consists of many states , instantiated by people and artifacts , all within a single system allowing the participants to get their work done . As Joan works to solve Michelle\u2019s problem , we see the process is apparently losing contextual information in many places \u2013 from payroll to HLG , from Nichole to Joan , from HLG to EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 175 Bene\ufb01ts , from Joan to Michelle ( in explaining the process ) , from Joan to the EVA representative , and \ufb01nally from Joan to the CAT record . Some of these di\ufb00erentiations correspond to boundaries with respect to the propagation of representational state and its re - interpretation . These boundaries often correspond with organizational divisions . Three of the four individuals involved in the call are all employees of CyberCorp . However , their di\ufb00erent roles imply di\ufb00erent meanings for the same representations . For the caller Michelle , Joan is the expert at HLG who will solve her problem . Pushing the notion of social boundaries to its extreme , even though Joan and Nichole are in the same department , Nichole\u2019s acknowledged expertise creates a boundary , and thus di\ufb00erent contextualizations between her and Joan . A comparison of these boundaries with the propagation of representations through the processing of the call illustrates how the cogni - tion involved ( i . e . , the use of memory ) is constrained by social arrangements . As representational state propagates across individuals , inter - organiza - tional , and intra - organizational boundaries , it must necessarily lose some of its context . As Star ( 1989 ) points out , boundary objects in an organization work because they necessarily contain su\ufb03cient detail to be understandable by both parties , but at the same time , neither party must understand the full context of use by the other . As boundary objects , artifacts and other po - tential resources are given to other people or in this case , stored for later use by others . This requires the information to be decontextualized . Otherwise , the secondary users will drown in unnecessary , unhelpful , or con\ufb02icting data . ( One may also wish to hide or obscure some institutional and social arrangements from the other group . ) As an example , the payroll records are necessarily standardized and stripped of much informational content before they can be given to groups such as HLG . Decontextualization , and perhaps commodi\ufb01cation , must be expected by those who will try to use the memory ( Schmidt and Bannon , 1992 ; Ackerman , 1993 ) . To reuse a memory , the user must then recontextualize that information ( Carr , 1961 ; Oakeshott , 1983 ; Schmidt and Bannon , 1992 ; Ackerman , 1993 ) . The information , if not supplied by the same individual , must be reunder - stood for the user\u2019s current purposes . Elsewhere we have written about the recontextualization problem in organizational memory systems ( Ackerman , 1996 ) , but the call shows that a di\ufb03culty , or even outright inability , in re - contextualization , would make the memory useless or nearly so . For exam - ple , reused information must be imbued with attributes of veracity , authenticity , and even status ( Anderson and Sharrock , 1993 ) ; it must be provided with everyday organizational context . Joan understands that the CARL database record is authoritative ; she knows enough of its meaning within HLG\u2019s context . Joan also knows she can ignore Nichole\u2019s advice , based on her understanding of HLG , Bene\ufb01ts , and EVA . Rather than adopt Nichole\u2019s advice \u2013 \ufb01nd out what EVA wants and MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 176 then escalate \u2013 Joan proceeds to convince EVA herself that Michelle is an employee . 5 . 9 . THE COMPLEXITY OF REUSE Obviously reuse is possible . Joan\u2019s call showed many memories reused by Joan , other members of the group , and the organization as a whole . We have also shown that these memories can be rearranged and reused in di\ufb00erent ways , depending on the production that is required . The above sections , however , cautioned that the informational require - ments for reuse are not trivial . For reuse , decontextualized information must be recontextualized su\ufb03ciently by the secondary user , according to his or her purposes . This is most likely to be done within a familiar process with little time lapse ( Ackerman , 1996 ) . In distributed cognition terms , the cost of reuse is most likely to be borne where the tra\ufb03c or the processing utility is highest \u2013 within heavily used or high payo\ufb00 processes . The problem with reuse , then , is the coexisting requirement for contex - tualization , decontextualization and recontextualization . To use information as a memory , one must remove the detail that provides context , making the information into a boundary object . However , at the same time one must consider how others will use it later as a resource in their processes ; other - wise , subsequent users of the memory will not be able to properly recon - textualize it . On the other side , based on their understanding of their own situations , users of a memory must determine what contextual aspects of that memory are important and whether they have changed . This determination may be nearly impossible , given people\u2019s limited view of an organization as well as the decontextualization of the information . Users must then decide how their di\ufb00ering context should e\ufb00ect their use of the memory , and \ufb01nally they must absorb the memory into their current situation . The simpler the memory , the more likely this all can occur . 5 . 10 . MEMORIES AS PROCESSES To summarize , we described a bene\ufb01ts veri\ufb01cation , one of the simplest procedures that HLG performs . Yet , this simple procedure exposed a num - ber of interesting aspects of organizational memory ( Table I ) . The procedure involved nine di\ufb00erent memories , and the human agent involved either translated among representational states or reconstructed memory states . We also noted that this process was simultaneously embedded within several short - term and long - term memory processes ( such as the formation of suit - able group statistics and a call - history ) . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 177 Perhaps most importantly , memories had mixed provenance . They were sometimes the provenance of the individual ( e . g . , Joan\u2019s scratch notes ) or the group ( e . g . , the call - handling procedure embedded in the telephone system ) . But , often enough , the memory that served Joan as individual memory also had a de\ufb01nition as a group and even an organizational memory . The call - tracking record , for example , was used by Joan to aid her short - term mem - ory , by the group to reconstruct a call - history , and by the organization to monitor the activities of the group . We also noted the importance of boundary objects and recontextualization in this analysis . In this veri\ufb01cation call , the recontextualization was relatively straightforward . In the next situation , however , Joan must deal with an exceptional call , one that clearly involves breakdowns . This next situation more clearly delineates what we see as the critical issues in recontextualiza - tion , namely trajectories and their projected consequences . 6 . Re - reading the record The second situation ( below ) involves re - reading a previously created call record . The situation spans a number of hours , and we present only portions of the transcript here . The \u2018\u2018COBRA man\u2019\u2019 , as Joan labels him in the call , had called earlier in the day , checking his coverage . In the U . S . companies are required to provide medical insurance for laid - o\ufb00 employees for one year . The law is called COBRA , and at CyberCorp the medical insurance was called \u2018\u2018COBRA bene\ufb01ts\u2019\u2019 or simply \u2018\u2018COBRA\u2019\u2019 . For the ex - employee to obtain his COBRA bene\ufb01ts , he had to periodically send in checks to Cyber - Corp . The ex - employee called to determine whether his current check had been received , because he had already had a problem with an earlier payment . The CyberCorp record , a spreadsheet , did not show his current payment . The ex - employee then pointed out to Joan that this had hap - pened before , and at the time , he had been found to be fully paid . He therefore asked whether this could have happened again . Joan said she would investigate . Table I .

ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 178 As part of her investigation , Joan looked at the earlier CAT records for this ex - employee . As mentioned , the CAT system allows an agent to pull up previous call records for a caller . Generally , this was used as a group memory of previous calls on a problem . Occasionally , the CAT records were used across problems to consider the history of a caller , especially one with an organizationally problematic situation . For example , one such call involved a caller who was trying to weasel an extension to his short - term disability . In the case of the COBRA man , Joan tried to use the previous CAT records to shed some light on his reliability and his current problem . Unfortunately , the earlier CAT records were not su\ufb03ciently complete \u2013 the ex - employee was providing details that were not in the record . In the following exchange , Joan double - checks with Lisa about one of the calls , one that occurred three months earlier . Because of the conversation\u2019s length , we include only excerpts here . Joan begins by restarting the COBRA conversation as Lisa is about to leave for the day . Joan brie\ufb02y describes the situation and what she can reconstruct of the previous call . Lisa initially says rather sharply that she remembers nothing of the call . Nonetheless , in turn 4 she o\ufb00ers to look at the call record , and by turn 8 , she is engaged in the problem . While Lisa reads her record , Joan provides a description of the caller\u2019s state - of - mind . Lisa\u2019s actions cannot be determined from the video , but during this period , there are conversational cues that she is reading her CAT record . She does not provide any cues that she remembers very much , if anything . Joan continues to describe the ex - employee\u2019s comments : The description in turn 21 seems to trigger Lisa\u2019s recollection . As the rec - ollection continues in turns 26 through 38 , Joan and Lisa show many 21 Joan And , you know , the feeling that nothing is happening for him . So he says , so , what if I get hit by a truck when I go outside and I don\u2019t have coverage ? What\u2019s going to happen to me ? 7 Joan I\u2019ve got the calls . There are like four COBRA calls , so I\u2019ve got the , uh , \u2026 , uh the serial numbers . 8 Lisa Give me mine . ( helpfully ) It might ring a bell . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 179 conversational signs , such as overlapping speech , that they are now acting in concert . In turns 26 through 34 , Lisa provides the memory that a person from the Bene\ufb01ts group came down to Lisa\u2019s cubicle with the ex - employee\u2019s \ufb01le . Together they determined that there had been an error : The payment had been logged incorrectly . ( There is a hint in turn 28\u2019s intonation that the Bene\ufb01ts person might have brought the \ufb01le down with the intention of proving the ex - employee wrong , but had been proven mistaken herself by Lisa . ) Joan declares in turn 35 that she will go ahead and send the problem on to Bene\ufb01ts as an \u2018\u2018escalation\u2019\u2019 . As before , inappropriate escalations sometimes furthered political tensions . Since escalations were always to some extent problematic , Joan and HLG felt the necessity to con\ufb01rm the details of a problem before sending it on to Bene\ufb01ts . Through this exchange , Joan recovered critical details of the previous call . The ex - employee was providing an accurate account . By checking into the record , Joan determined that he was probably telling the truth about the current situation . More importantly , Joan recovered key contextual infor - mation about Bene\ufb01t\u2019s analysis of the situation . In order to accurately weigh the evidence to be presented in the escalation , the CAT record , being incomplete , needed extraordinary recontextualization . Of course , if the record had been available only as a decontextualized object , it may have been possible for the escalation to succeed . However , one 26 Lisa \\ I actually do remember that . / I remember she had his \ufb01le . She brought it down = 27 Joan ( agreeing ) = mm - hm 28 Lisa and she went ( quickly , mock tone ) oops ( normal voice ) , it got logged wrong . He is paid . 29 Joan Okay . 30 Lisa Yeah it was our error \u2026 31 Joan Yeah . 32 Lisa Not ours , but it\u2019s their error in logging it . They didn\u2019t log it in \u2026 33 Joan Well \u2026 ( Joan starts to put away a cup on her desk ) 34 Lisa When they received it . 35 Joan I\u2019m going to go ahead and \u2026 and do the escalation . I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d have any impact to the call . That\u2019s \ufb01ne . I was just wondering because he\u2019s said = 36 Lisa = I know that CyberCorp had made an error there 37 Joan / Um , okay \\ 38 Lisa \\ At the ti / me MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 180 can easily imagine that extra work ( if not the repeat of the diagnostic e\ufb00ort ) would have been required by the organization . Nonetheless , one might wonder why so little was written in the CAT record . 6 . 1 . TRAJECTORIES AND THE MEMORY PROCESS \u2026 consider the cognitive properties of the team as a whole . \u2026 It is not the case that two or more heads are always better than one . ( Hutchins , 1995 , p . xvi ) Lisa chose to write up a terse CAT record on the previous call , necessitating Joan\u2019s extraordinary recontextualization . Agents wrote very short , terse CAT records when they felt that no one would later need the record . For example , the CAT record where a caller veri\ufb01es that a person is a CyberCorp employee ( e . g . , for a mortgage application ) might be a single line , if the agent even wrote a record . Employee veri\ufb01cations were not revisited . In Lisa\u2019s call , she assumed that she should hurry through the write - up . HLG gets rewarded for fast wrap - ups , and avoiding copious notes for all calls is required . The ex - employee\u2019s payment had been found , the logging corrected , and the problem recti\ufb01ed . The trajectory of future use appeared to be obvious . Trajectory ( Strauss , 1993 ; Hutchins , 1995 ) describes the path of an event ; in this case , we mean it to be the likely trajectory as anticipated . Strauss ( 1993 ) explains trajectory by using the example from medical diagnosis : The treatment of a fever is dependent on its anticipated trajectory . Treatment of a simple fever for a healthy 25 - year - old male is quite di\ufb00erent than that for an HIV - positive male . The anticipated trajectory of a situation is often critical to organizational processes and is usually based on trajectories of past experi - ence \u2013 what Hutchins calls developmental trajectory . Past experience in the development of the practice , the practitioners and the conduct of the activity a\ufb00ect the present of the activity . The incentives for keeping memory follow the developmental trajectory , the assumed trajectory , and its projected consequences . In this case , Lisa assumed that the call would never be referenced again ; she had little incentive to write a complete call record . Joan had to deal with the unanticipated ( and perhaps unanticipatable ) consequences of Lisa\u2019s projecting the trajectory incorrectly . One can perhaps see this even more clearly in Joan\u2019s escalation of the problem . She must weigh the event\u2019s trajectory and projected consequences to create a correctly formed escalation . As mentioned , she must now escalate the problem to the Bene\ufb01ts group ; she must therefore create a boundary object . Slightly over 20 min after her conversation with Lisa , Joan begins to EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 181 rewrite the CAT record for the current call ; this will also be sent to Bene\ufb01ts as the escalation record . The trajectory is now that the CAT record will be reused as a boundary object , so that Bene\ufb01ts can understand the problem . In a lengthy aside to the observer as she prepared the escalation , Joan pointed out the facets of \u2018\u2018appropriate\u2019\u2019 escalation for this case . Clearly part of what Joan must do is to lay out the \u2018\u2018facts\u2019\u2019 of the case . Initially , this is what she traces through as she describes the process of creating an escalation . She has veri\ufb01ed that the COBRA man is providing accurate details , and she states this is important . She [ Lisa ] did give me good information because , um , he , the employee had told me that he had called before and spoken with Lisa and , um . ( pause ) The Bene\ufb01ts specialist came down , and said well , I know , he\u2019s covered . [ \u2026 ] So that is , uh , something I can put in this call \u2026 She goes on to say that she needs to suggest to Bene\ufb01ts that the ex - employee may be correct . Lisa\u2019s given me information I can share with Sally [ a Bene\ufb01ts person ] saying , I\u2019ve spoken to Lisa and she said yeah , it was logged wrong , and you know , you have his \ufb01le . Is this possible \u2026 that this has happened again , or what is the situation . So far , she is merely detailing the \u2018\u2018facts\u2019\u2019 as she has uncovered them . However , Joan then continues her comment by explaining why she is spending so much time creating the appropriate escalation record . A con - siderable amount of time is spent removing extraneous detail from the CAT record . She tells the camera that she must pick her facts with care , removing extraneous detail ( i . e . , decontextualizing the actual record ) and double - checking any detail that remains . A lot of this information I just take as I\u2019m writing , as I\u2019m , um , taking the call , and it\u2019s not just pertinent information to share with the Bene\ufb01ts folk , but that\u2019s , you know , having to go back and just kinda clean up the call before we send it over \u2026 as an escalation . 6 . 2 . OBJECTS IN PROCESSES AND PROCESSES IN OBJECTS Joan edits and re - edits the CAT record for the escalation . While this is partly a result of Joan\u2019s inexperience with COBRA bene\ufb01ts , the following suggests that she is also rewriting the record to cover any uncertainty or incompetency as well : Part of the amount of time it takes is really making sure that the information we\u2019re sending over is really accurate and \u2026 when there are MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 182 um , areas , like , I don\u2019t live and breathe COBRA information , so what might be important , what I might think is important information , might be nothing to them . As Joan traces through what makes an appropriate escalation record , her explanation begins to deviate from merely detailing the facts . The escalation record will go to Bene\ufb01ts , as discussed above , a group with which HLG has had problematic relations . Indeed , it may become part of the evidence in any later status con\ufb02icts . This escalation record , then , serves as part of HLG\u2019s organizational \u2018\u2018face\u2019\u2019 . Joan points out to the camera that a proper escalation must be complete and accurate \u2013 in a word , what Bene\ufb01ts requires and nothing more . This CAT record , and Joan\u2019s anticipated consequence , is that the record will be thoroughly scrutinized by Joan\u2019s supervisor and by some part of Bene\ufb01ts . Both will judge the record\u2019s quality . ( Joan was seen as a good employee by her supervisors , although she was unsure why she had not been promoted to supervisory status herself . We have already described Bene\ufb01ts\u2019 interactions with the HLG . ) One of the supervisors , um , will check and make sure it\u2019s accurate information and the call notes are complete . And she\u2019ll say did you check , you know , the system , or did you check this out . Presumably this judgment will be part of future interactions between Joan and her supervisor as well as HLG and Bene\ufb01ts . In a sense , then , a boundary object is only partially an \u2018\u2018object\u2019\u2019 . It is also an event in many di\ufb00erent organizational processes . Later boundary objects ( and possibly previous objects ) will be understood in light of this particular boundary object and its implications . An organizational member\u2019s assumptions about anticipated consequences and potential trajectories will include not only the current situation , but future situations as well . In summary , this situation shows that raw CAT records are hardly useful . They can jog an individual\u2019s memory , but we saw that Lisa needed additional cues to actually recover her memory . They can serve as a group memory , but Joan could not adequately recontextualize Lisa\u2019s record . Finally , the CAT records can serve as boundary objects between groups , but this can take considerable work . Obviously , not all attempts to reuse CAT records were failures . Most reuse appeared e\ufb00ortless and seamless . This example , however , highlights the everyday work that must be done to make reuse appear e\ufb00ortless in its success . Much of that work involves being able to properly recontextualize a record , given that the person who created it properly understood its later reuse . In other words , later recontextualization succeeds or su\ufb00ers from earlier assumptions about the record\u2019s trajectory . EXAMINATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY IN USE 183 7 . Conclusions This study has many limitations . As with many ethnographies , the repre - sentativeness of HLG and its activities could be argued . We have been able to present only a few simple cases here . Yet , within these limits , we have tried to show that : \u2022 There is no such thing as an organizational memory per se , as the organizational memory metaphor attempts to invoke . We have tried to detail how a supra - individual memory works in its use of multiple people and many artifacts . Our analysis also demonstrated the utility of dis - tributed cognition theory in understanding such a supra - individual memory . These simple calls and their distributed cognition analysis exposed a number of interesting aspects of this organization\u2019s memory at a micro - level . We also showed how : \u2022 The bene\ufb01ts veri\ufb01cation procedure involved nine at least di\ufb00erent memory states and the human agent involved either translated among representational states or reconstructed memory states . \u2022 Even this simple procedure was a complex case of distributed memory . Memories were complexly distributed , interwoven , and occasionally overlaid . They had a mixed provenance . Sometimes they belonged to the individual ( e . g . , Joan\u2019s scratch notes ) or the group ( e . g . , the call - handling procedure embedded in the telephone system ) . But , often enough , the memory that served as individual memory also had a de\ufb01nition as a group and even an organizational memory . \u2022 While knowledge management largely restricts itself to viewing organi - zational memory as repositories of experience \u2018\u2018objects\u2019\u2019 that are magi - cally reusable , we have tried to show that it is more fruitful to consider organizational memory as both object and process . Memory is both an artifact that holds its state and an artifact that is simultaneously embedded in many organizational and individual processes . \u2022 The container metaphor is easier to consider computationally , but it is extremely limited organizationally . The distributed cognition view of a network of artifacts and people , of memory and of processing , bound by social arrangements , provides a deeper and ultimately more usable understanding of organizational life . It describes how memory as rep - resentational states can be both separated from organizational actors , and is at the same time , necessarily bound to their actions and under - standings . \u2022 The second call highlighted the issues of decontextualization and recon - textualization that are required to e\ufb00ectively turn a memory \u2018\u2018object\u2019\u2019 into MARK S . ACKERMAN & CHRISTINE HALVERSON 184 a memory process . As memory crosses between groups or even across time , it becomes a b oundary object , attempting to serve the needs of both creator and reader but lacking the full context of either . To properly serve the reader or re - user of the memory , the creator must properly project the consequences of the memory\u2019s later use , or trajectory . This can be a dif - \ufb01cult matter , although people do it everyday in their work . This paper has highlighted many of the issues and problems in creating memories that are used and are found usable by groups and organizations . We have also proposed a number of theoretical concepts ( Strauss , 1991 ) \u2013 distributed memories , simultaneous embedment , mixed provenance , bound - ary objects , recontextualization , and trajectory \u2013 that enabled us to analyze the use of memory in these calls . However , we have seen , even in these examples , that memories do get created and reused . More work will be required to examine the details of how work activities evolve memories . Our current work examines how memories evolve , becoming resources in similar complex environments . We are also examining how much memories are maintained and reused over time .

  "andersonDataBaseMent2008": "9 Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) : Supporting Configuration in Organizational Information Systems Stuart Anderson , Gillian Hardstone , Rob Procter , and Robin Williams Abstract We present a case study of a project to introduce a new organization - wide , inte - grated information system within the UK healthcare sector that we conducted as part of a wider , socio - technical exploration of factors influencing the dependabil - ity of computer - based systems . We report in detail on the problems of working with and evolving a standardized classification of work procedures that is central to the organizational purpose of the new IT system , and the responses of both us - ers and of the project team to these problems . These have important implications for the usability of computer - based systems and for the dependability of the in - formation they contain . Drawing insights from sociological studies of classifica - tion and standardization , we reflect upon the lessons for the development and im - plementation of computer - based systems designed to serve as \u201ccommon information spaces . \u201d 9 . 1 Introduction In many domains of administrative and professional life , and for what may seem to be good organizational reasons , there is a tendency to classify in - formation in increasingly standardized ways . Sometimes , this may result as a side effect ( intended or otherwise ) of other organizational changes . For example , the process of designing and implementing new organizational IT systems necessarily involves reaching agreement\u2014implicitly or tac - itly\u2014about the codification and interpretation of the data that are to be held on the system . Numerous decisions have to be made as to how to classify information , that is , how to represent it through the choice of cate - gorical definitions , structures , and names , and who may have access to 222 Anderson et al . what information and how . Sometimes , these issues can be resolved inter - nally ; in other cases , resort will be made to an established , external stan - dard or system of classification . The latter may include public computer standards or de facto standards embedded in widely established software systems . The adoption of these standards is fraught with problems , how - ever . It may , for example , necessitate the elimination of existing and more local classification and coding practices . In the process of moving informa - tion from its local origins to a standardized , organization - wide classifica - tion , the local meaning and organization of information that underpins cur - rent work practices may be sacrificed ( see , for example , Heath and Luff 1996 ) . If such changes are not managed appropriately , the consequences are likely to be disruptive , impairing system usability , and potentially pre - senting a significant threat to the dependability of information and of the decisions based thereon\u2014with important implications for the activities and goals of the organization . Questions regarding how decisions about the classification of informa - tion are made , become inscribed in technological artifacts , are incorporated into everyday working practices , modified , or worked around become crucial for understanding how the work of organizations and groups is car - ried out . Once we recognize these processes , we can see why it is impor - tant to allow IT systems to evolve and how this might be facilitated . To in - vestigate these issues , we have been conducting a field study of the introduction of a complex , commercial software package within a large UK primary healthcare organization , known as a \u201cTrust . \u201d The Patient In - formation Management System ( PiMS ) has been introduced with the aim of integrating and standardizing patient administration practices within the Trust\u2019s numerous different healthcare service teams . The expected benefits include higher - quality , more uniform data about activity across all the units within the Trust to enable management to make more accurate re - source allocation decisions ; and more timely , accessible , and detailed clinical data to inform clinical users\u2019 care of patients , and to support evi - dence - based practice and research activity . Our interests center around the ongoing efforts of the PiMS Implementation Group , PiMS Project Team , PiMS User Group and others to evolve the configuration of the system to fit the organization and its users . One particular focus of the study has been the PiMS \u201cContact Purpose\u201d menu . Prior to the implementation of PiMS , each of the Trust\u2019s healthcare services relied upon its own locally meaningful classifications of contact purpose , that is , the reason formally documented for each and every occa - sion a healthcare professional interacts with a specific patient . With the Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 223 introduction of PiMS , the Trust has introduced a new , standard contact purpose classification and embedded this into the system\u2019s user interface menus . Our findings are that PiMS clinical users are struggling to make sense of the new contact purpose categories , sometimes having to resort to the \u201cNot Specified\u201d option when they are unable to match the situation at hand with the newly standardized categories , or more often selecting from several seemingly similar options the category that seems nearest . The overall result is that users are unhappy that PiMS doesn\u2019t fit in with their work practices and Trust management is concerned that the quality of data captured is too poor to support its strategic goals . We report on the difficulties of working with and evolving a classification of work practices whose use is central to the organizational purpose of the new system . Our aim is to reflect on the methodological implications of needing to address such problems . We begin with a review of the literature on classifica - tion as a socio - technical process . We then present the case study , detailing the responses of both the Trust healthcare teams and of the PiMS Project Team to the problematic contact purposes menu . Finally , we discuss the implications of our findings for approaches to the implementation , deployment , and evolution of IT systems . The detailed focus upon the design , implementation , and use of IT systems allows us to reflect on the various opportunities that may exist\u2014 whether in terms of improved change management procedures or more appro - priate systems architectures\u2014to evolve IT systems such that they become more effective and dependable in use . 9 . 2 Classification and Categorization : A Socio - Technical Perspective To analyze the issues that arose with the introduction of PiMS , we draw upon some recent developments in the sociology of classification and categorization . Star ( 1989 ) introduced the concept of boundary objects to explain how intellectual and work activities may be coordinated across diverse groups spread across different physical and social settings / sites with their own more or less differentiated local knowledges and perspectives . Crucially , boundary objects \u201care both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and con - straints of the several parties employing them , yet robust enough to main - tain a common identity across sites . They are weakly structured in com - mon use and become strongly structured in individual - site use\u201d ( Star 1989 ) . Boundary objects thus allow both autonomy and \u201ctrade\u201d across boundaries ( Star and Griesemer 1989 ) . This concept has been widely 224 Anderson et al . applied to understanding information system design activities regarding the relationships both between different groups of design specialists and with heterogeneous groups of potential \u201cusers . \u201d The typology of boundary objects ranges from those that are \u201cplatonic\u201d ( entirely virtual ) to those em - bodied in physical artifacts such as standardized forms , etc . Together , these are part of a broader information infrastructure\u2014a negotiated order of tools , practices , and resources\u2014through which knowledge work is cordinated and conducted ( Bowker and Star 1999 ) . There has been considerable interest in the extension of this framework to analyze the processes whereby classification schema are created in un - derstanding information exchanges among heterogeneous communities , in particular in the emergence of scientific fields and in the design and use of information systems\u2014since the latter inevitably involves \u201clinking experi - ence gained in one time and place with that gained in another , via repre - sentations of some co - ordination work \u2026 encoding and decoding as time and place shift\u201d ( Bowker and Star 1999 , p . 290 ) . Berg and Bowker ( 1997 ) , for example , have applied this framework to analyzing medical records as a boundary object , an \u201corganisational infrastructure \u2026 that affords the in - terplay and coordination between divergent worlds\u201d of physicians , nurses , health insurers , etc . The implementation of computer - based systems intended to serve in place of organizational information infrastructures based upon direct inter - personal contacts\u2014or mediated through traditional media such as paper records\u2014opens up enormous possibilities from the more rapid and rigor - ous exchange of such codified data , creating a \u201ccommon information space\u201d ( Bannon and B\u00f8dker 1997 ) with opportunities for more effective coordination of activities separated in time and space . However , the cate - gorization and standardization this entails at the same time bring risks , for example , in terms of the reduced \u201cplasticity\u201d of the system and of prevent - ing local elaboration of information practices to cater for particular cir - cumstances\u2014the very attributes that define a boundary object and give it its value ( Star 1993 ) . The meaning of information may change or be lost when it is removed from particular local settings , and is codified and sepa - rated from , perhaps \u201cinvisible , \u201d taken - for - granted local knowledges that support its interpretation . This shows that it is not sufficient to provide a common information space for pooling and accessing information ; its value as a coordinating device can only be realized if there is a shared understanding of meaning . Without this , the result may be a reduction in the organization\u2019s capacity to function dependably , whether through the misinterpretation of information or through the loss of trust in the veracity of information held upon the Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 225 system . A study by Reddy et al . ( 2001 ) develops this line of analysis , criti - cizing narrow technical views of the common information space as artifact and highlighting that this also involves the work practices that surround it . 1 They point to \u201cthe tension between the need for both openness ( supporting work practices ) and closure ( supporting coordination ) , \u201d the resolution of which depends upon features of the work and work setting ( Ibid . ) . Analy - sis must address how various groups use , manage , and integrate informa - tion into their work . However , overcoming these differences is far from trivial ; the diversity of the information practices and categories adopted by diverse work groups are a reflection of their specific functions , organiza - tional locales , traditions , priorities , and interests . It is a difficult and politi - cally sensitive undertaking and calls for an evolutionary , socio - technical approach to the implementation of organizational IT systems . Work prac - tices and related artifacts are not stable , but change in response to changing needs . Implementing new systems changes both the practices and , in an it - erative process , changes the system itself . Similarly , users are forced to adapt , to use ad hoc practices and , in so doing , the work also changes . Socio - technical systems are thus mutually constituting and adaptive as or - ganizations and work practices constantly evolve . This is an active process involving contributions from a wide range of organization members as well as technical specialists . These issues are particularly relevant to understanding the introduction of commercial off - the - shelf ( COTS ) software packages . The generic mod - els of work practice embodied in standard solutions are far removed from the particular working practices and requirements of the various groups of actual users . Successful implementation requires an often - extended adapta - tion process in configuring together generic system capabilities with the specific practices and contexts of organizational users . The problems of evolving COTS are far greater in the context of organizationally complex , large - scale working activities , where there is often a need to come to deci - sions about what level of local variation is feasible and desirable in infor - mation handling and administrative practice . This is particularly true of demanding and / or large - scale organizational information environments where failure involves potentially high costs ( Brady et al . 1992 ; Clausen and Williams 1997 ; Cornford and Pollock 2003 ) . 1 Echoing Fleck\u2019s earlier ( 1988 ) insistence that an understanding of \u201cinformation integration\u201d must address in tandem not only the formal computer - based system , but also the work and communication / coordination practices of the organization and its members . 226 Anderson et al . 9 . 3 The Case Study Patient information management systems are a key technology at the heart of healthcare strategy aimed at generating new knowledge to guide a vari - ety of healthcare processes ( e . g . , clinical decision making , resource alloca - tion , and clinical governance ) . At the heart of most Patient Information Systems , users are asked to take classification decisions about a variety of different situations . The quality of the classification and of the classifica - tion activity are key to the quality of the knowledge being generated by the system . Bigcity 2 Primary Care Trust ( BPCT ) has some 7 , 500 members of staff serving a population of some 620 , 000 people , across a wide range of geog - raphy\u2014a large Scottish city and the rural surroundings of Bigshire , the county to which Bigcity belongs\u2014with a comprehensive range of services . These services include mental health , learning disabilities , care of the elderly , medical rehabilitation , district nursing and health visiting , family plan - ning / well woman , breast screening , comprehensive dental care , and those provided by professions allied to medicine ( such as physiotherapy ) . Some highly specialist services include brain injury rehabilitation , bioengineer - ing and prosthetics , drugs and alcohol misuse and harm reduction , AIDS / HIV , and child and family psychiatric services . PiMS is a COTS package produced by HealthCo , a company that de - scribes itself as a \u201cspecialist application content provider\u201d focused on healthcare markets in largely English - speaking ( including Commonwealth ) countries around the world . PiMS is becoming widely used by NHS Trusts in the UK , of which BPCT\u2019s implementation appears to be one of the most thoroughgoing , as others have often been ( deliberately ) partial . BPCT it - self has only implemented PiMS in its mental health and related services . HealthCo describes PiMS in the following terms : The PiMS patient information management system provides a highly intelli - gent store for totally integrated information across all care settings in both the public and private sectors . PiMS has the flexibility and functional breadth to extend beyond traditional care boundaries to support acute care , community care , mental health , child health , aged care and social services . Integrated information access supports all those healthcare professionals in - volved in care delivery with the same accurate , timely information to en - hance performance and improve communications . . . PiMS provides the power not simply to cope with change , but to drive it . ( HealthCo Website ) 2 Names of organizations and people have been anonymized . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 227 As we shall see , how far these claims are borne out in BPCT\u2019s imple - mentation and user practice to date remains debatable . 9 . 3 . 1 Methodology The investigation reported here is based on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork carried out in BPCT . Data collection methods included partici - pant observation and semistructured interviews with a range of personnel across a number of sites within the Trust , in both clinical and nonclinical departments or settings . The first round of data collection in BPCT took place between autumn 2001 and spring 2002 , after which an initial report of fieldwork findings on the implementation process to date , together with some recommendations for action , were presented to Trust managers ( Hardstone 2002 ) . The sites of clinical practice were chosen in order to compare PiMS implementation in a locality - based General Adult Mental Health Service ( SW BigCity ) with that in one of the larger specialist services , the Alco - hol Problems Service . Both of these services were comprised of more than one team : SW Area having three ( Outreach , Day Hospital , and Community Psychiatric Nurses , or CPNs ) and Alcohol Problems Service having two ( Resource and CPNs ) . Each team covered a different aspect of its service\u2019s mental health provision and had its own caseloads , and therefore had different work patterns and practices influencing its use of PiMS . While CPN Teams were occupationally homogeneous , others had a broader membership , including consultants , nurses , CPNs , occupational and other therapists , and social workers , as well as medical secretaries . In the context of this paper , each team had a different array of purposes for contact with patients . Nonclinical settings in which fieldwork was conducted included regular meetings of the PiMS Implementation Group ( weekly ) and the PiMS User Group ( monthly ) . These involved members of the Project Team responsi - ble for implementing PiMS , and staff from the Information Services ( IS ) and Clinical Governance ( CG ) Teams . The latter two groups were users of PiMS data from an administrative perspective , analyzing data from the system in order to compile mental healthcare statistics for decision making within and beyond BPCT . All had an interest in ensuring the completeness , accuracy , and timeliness of data entry , including the use of the Contact Purpose menu . Detailed notes were made during participant observation by the field - worker of activities and discussions observed and artifacts employed , such as healthcare workers\u2019 notes and patient records , both computer - based and 228 Anderson et al . manual , as staff went about their everyday work in an office setting . Cop - ies of documents and reports relating to implementation and use of PiMS were also analyzed . Specifically , clinical work ( one - to - one or group therapy ) was not observed for reasons of patient confidentiality . Semistructured in - terviews were conducted with a variety of staff , both administrative and clinical , including members of all the occupational groups described above . For the first round of interviews , all staff available in each of the selected Teams were interviewed . The fieldworker made notes during in - terviews and meetings , which were sometimes taped where BPCT staff consented . Ethnography observes in detail everyday working practices and seeks to explicate the numerous , situated ways in which those practices are actually achieved and the things that such an achievement turns upon . The data comprise field notes and transcriptions of interviews with staff about their everyday work , their use of PiMS and other information systems , both manual and computer - based , their training on PiMS , and also their use of the Trust\u2019s previous computer systems . The method seeks to explicate the situated character of work , as a practical production by social actors per - forming their activities within all the contingencies of local circumstances . It aims to portray the variety of activities and interactions that comprise the \u201cworkaday\u201d of working life , and the ways in which these are understood and accomplished by those who do that work . The veracity of findings was established using a number of techniques . These included triangulation through the collection of data by multiple methods and sources . Verification was performed through discussions of findings with clinical and nonclinical BPCT staff ; in feedback sessions with the clinical staff interviewed at their weekly team meetings ; and in a Trust - wide workshop for feedback and discussion on the PiMS implemen - tation project . As fieldwork progressed , comparisons were also be drawn between the activities of workers over time and between members of dif - ferent occupational groups . 9 . 3 . 2 BPCT and the PiMS Project BPCT provides a wide variety of general and specialist mental health ser - vices that cater for patients\u2019 needs from cradle to grave . Services range from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services ( CAMHS ) through general adult to care of the elderly , while some of the more specialist ser - vices include the Alcohol Problems Service ( APS ) , the Centre for Drug Prevention Services ( CDPS ) , and centers for the treatment of patients with eating disorders , and post - traumatic stress disorder . Mental health provision Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 229 in the region is organized on a geographical basis , comprising West Big - shire , Mid Bigshire , East Bigshire , and BigCity\u2014the latter being subdi - vided into five areas ( NE , NW , SE , SW , and S Central ) . Each of these eight areas provides general mental health services , with some of the lar - ger , centralized specialist services , such as APS , also having staff perma - nently deployed to a geographic area . For other cases requiring specialist care , patients are referred to the relevant BigCity facility . The roll - out of PiMS in BPCT commenced in April 2001 and was still ongoing as of autumn 2002 , first in the BigCity areas , and later in Big - shire . This new integrated system was intended to replace numerous separate systems developed and used by the different services . These in - cluded two non - integrated computer - based systems : PSYMON , for in - patient care , and CIS , for Community Care . One of the major differ - ences between PiMS and these previous systems was that clinical staff would now take responsibility for the entry of information relating to patient care . Previously , this had been the work of the central Medical Records unit . The expressed organizational goal of the project is to integrate data and information across the Trust , \u201c so we\u2019re all singing from the same hymn sheet \u201d ( former PiMS Project Manager ) . Raising the quality ( accu - racy , completeness , and timeliness ) of mental health information through the implementation of PiMS has both a clinical and an adminis - trative purpose . The objective is to improve patient care , and to in - crease the validity of the statistics produced by the Trust\u2019s Information Services ( IS ) department ( 1 ) for BPCT\u2019s internal ( regional ) decision - making and resource allocation , and ( 2 ) to satisfy external reporting re - quirements to the Information and Records Division ( IRD ) of the re - gional government , which uses BPCT\u2019s information for policy - making and national resource allocation , and in the compilation of national mental health statistics . PiMS was \u201csold\u201d to clinical users with the ex - pectation that they would be able to extract from it all kinds of useful data never before so easily available or manipulable , both for research purposes and to move toward an improved and increasingly evidence - based clinical practice . PiMS is a database - driven system , based on Microsoft and Oracle tech - nologies . It is a modular system , which is claimed to be configurable to the requirements of each user\u2019s organization . This configuration occurs at a number of levels . First , users decide in which functional areas they wish to use PiMS , from the following selection of modules ( Table 9 . 1 ) . 230 Anderson et al . Table 9 . 1 . PiMS modules . \u2022 Master patient index \u2022 Outpatient management \u2022 Clinic management \u2022 Accident & Emergency management \u2022 Pharmacy management \u2022 Mental health management and Mental Health Act 3 management \u2022 Child health management \u2022 Patient document tracking and document management \u2022 Electronic patient record management \u2022 Integration with office administration systems ( Micro - soft Office 2000 ) \u2022 Inpatient management \u2022 Day case management \u2022 Community healthcare management \u2022 Theatre department management \u2022 Equipment management \u2022 Learning disabilities management \u2022 Infection control management \u2022 Care pathway management and clinical audit reporting \u2022 Contract management and billing \u2022 Patient , business , and clinical management information and statutory reporting \u2022 Integration with third - party systems including analysers Source : From HealthCo Website ; areas active in BPCT\u2019s PiMS in italics . Each of these modules has a main menu . Use of some of the menu op - tions will be common to more than one module . For example , most clinical departments ( A & E , Outpatients , Inpatients , Mental Health , Day Surgery ) will need to search for patients in the system , or register new patients . The BPCT PiMS main menu is shown in Table 9 . 2 . 3 Under the terms of the Scottish Mental Health Act , inpatients may only be detained ngth of time before a new request for further detention needs to be submitted to the appropriate authority . involuntarily ( or \u201csectioned\u201d ) for a specific le Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 231 Table 9 . 2 .

The database behind each set of modules is then configured for the indi - vidual Trust , naming its specific wards , departments , teams , and individual healthcare practitioners ( HCPs ) . Within BPCT , the system has been further configured to include data analysis software from other suppliers , and also clinical assessment tools , such as the Cambridge Assessment of Need ( CANSAS ) . At the lowest level within PiMS , pull - down menus within each submodule can be customized to suit the user organization . One such 4 Of diagnosis , in accordance with ICD10 , the International Classification of Dis - eases . 5 Of patients , by individual practitioner , team , or specialty . 6 The term applied to an overall period of care , from initial presentation to dis - charge . In the case of chronic illness , often the period from one crisis presenta - tion to the next . 232 Anderson et al . menu within the Contact submodule of PiMS is the Contact Purpose menu , by which HCPs record the purpose of their contacts with patients . System roll - out within the Trust is the responsibility of the five - person PiMS Project Team , which includes the Project Manager , the Systems Administrator , and three other staff who also have a training role . This team is co - located at BPCT\u2019s main city site , the Royal City Hospital ( RCH ) . Project implementation in the broader sense is the responsibility of the PiMS Implementation Group , which comprises representatives from the PiMS Project Team and the Trust\u2019s IS department , together with the General Adult Mental Health Services Manager and the Specialist Service Development Manager . PiMS Implementation Group members are not co - located , but meet weekly at the RCH . Once a month , members of both the Implementation Group and the Project Team attend the PiMS User Group meeting , together with a small number of users , to receive feedback from users and to provide information on implementation progress and on how user concerns have been addressed . At present , PiMS is used for data entry , retrieval , and analysis by a vari - ety of professional groups , each of which constitutes different communi - ties of knowledge and practice and has different interests . PiMS is used to record Currently , data entry is performed within the Trust\u2019s multi - disciplinary teams largely by secretarial , nursing , and related staff , such as occupational therapists . Very few medical consultants or junior doctors use the system themselves , preferring to handwrite records , and delegating computer data entry to their team secretaries . PiMS is currently used ( albeit less frequently ) by HCPs to retrieve information about \u2022 patient admissions to wards ( in - patient episodes ) , \u2022 the timetable of planned contacts with other practitioners ( in order to spread these evenly over time ) , \u2022 patient details at registration and after ( such demographic details as contact address and phone number , GP address and phone number ) , \u2022 referrals of the patient to BPCT , either from external sources ( such as GPs , self - referral ) , or from elsewhere within the Trust ( between practitioners ) , \u2022 planned / booked patient appointments , \u2022 details of each contact the patient has with Trust Mental Health practitioners , \u2022 details of patient assessments carried out by Trust practitioners . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 233 \u2022 the history of the patient\u2019s previous contacts with HCPs within BPCT , \u2022 the patient\u2019s medication history , \u2022 warnings and alerts connected with a patient ( for risk assessment ; including drug allergies , episodes of self - harm or violence to others ) . Because of system structure , availability of software and training in its use , and data protection and patient confidentiality issues , the use of PiMS for analysis has been restricted to a small group of users , mainly members of the PiMS Implementation Group . The reports facility on PiMS has not been activated . However , using data / database analysis software tools such as Access , Crystal , and Cube linked into the PiMS data , this group of users produces regular healthcare statistics and reports for BPCT and IRD . Clinical service - based PiMS users are able to request the production of other reports on an ad hoc basis , progress of which is monitored by the Implementation Group once approved . There are currently moves to make PiMS data analysis quicker and easier , but access will continue to be restricted . Examples of reports produced by analyzing PiMS data include PiMS embodies a generic model of the information flows and work practices of the sector . The package had been already customized to meet the requirements drawn up by BPCT . However , initial post roll - out field the system\u2019s users . This raises a number of issues relating to 9 . 3 . 3 The Contact Purpose Menu Every time HCPs within the Trust have contact with a patient , whether face - to - face or over the telephone , whether one - to - one or with other HCPs ( as at work revealed several areas in which this a priori configuration has proven inadequate for how lessons from use of systems can be feedback into ongoing configuration work . Here , we focus on the configuration and evolution of the Contact Purpose menu within the Contact module of PiMS , a central element of the system for both BPCT and service users . \u2022 monthly Trust Activity Report , analyzed down to team level ( for IRD , IS , and teams ) , \u2022 monthly Error reports ( for IS and teams ) , \u2022 monthly report on out - of - area patients treated ( for Finance , to recoup costs from the patient\u2019s home area Trust ) , \u2022 ad hoc report on all hospital detentions in Bigcity over 12 - month period , \u2022 ad hoc report on number of referrals to a particular clinic ( for the clinic administrator ) . 234 Anderson et al . a care planning meeting ) , they enter this and other associated data , such as date , time , duration , location , Trust personnel involved , and the healthcare team they belong to into the Contact submodule of PiMS . There is also a pull - down menu for the Contact Purpose , from which HCPs have to select one option . This effectively classifies the work done by HCPs Trust - wide into standard categories . Most of the clinical and care - related details of the contact are entered manually in patients\u2019 casenote folders at present , since PiMS in BPCT does not ( yet ) involve an Electronic Patient Record . The sig - nificance of the Contact Purpose menu seems to lie in the fact that it is one of the few points in PiMS where they enter data that really matter to them\u2014 data they feel should reflect their day - to - day practice accurately . The original menu for \u201ccontact purpose\u201d was supplied by HealthCo , having already been configured from the English version to suit the Scottish mental health and legal systems . It was initially reconfigured to BPCT\u2019s requirements prior to roll - out . It was subsequently reconfigured again during the early phases of roll - out in response to certain users\u2019 feedback , and other additions have been made to the menu at intervals since . Its evolution is discussed later in this section of the paper . The current ( as of June 2002 ) and complete PiMS contact purpose options are ( alphabetically , the order in which they appear on the pull - down menu ) shown in Table 9 . 3 , with \u201cNot Specified\u201d as the default option . During the first round of fieldwork , two important strands of research data emerged about the use of the Contact Purpose menu ; one from clinical users seeking to input their practice - related data into PiMS , the other from the perspective of the PiMS Project and IS Teams , which were trying to ensure compliance with system use and quality of data entry . Many of the clinical users interviewed reported difficulties choosing which option to select on the Contact Purpose menu , because the categories did not fit the way they would have described the work they did with patients . This could be because the specific practices of their particular professional grouping were not reflected in the menu options : You\u2019ve got [ what an ] Occupational Therapist does and she would have to report that as a \u201cFollow - Up\u201d [ but ] it doesn\u2019t really describe what goes on . ( Team Leader , SW Area Outreach ) It could also be because the menu failed to reflect the work of the team . For example , some teams caring long - term for people with severe and enduring mental illness had on their caseloads patients who needed support to undertake even basic daily activities , such as shopping , socializing , and leisure , \u201cJust social contact \u2026 that\u2019s recorded as \u2018Follow - up\u2019 , which doesn\u2019t really describe \u2026 it doesn\u2019t really accurately describe what we do\u201d ( Team Leader , SW Area Outreach ) . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 235 Delivering medication was another such significant activity for which there was no menu option . It was one of a range of medication - related practices that included supervised medication and the intramuscular administration of medication ( depot ) , all of which would typically be performed by a single team , but each of which implied rather different degrees of illness and patterns of patient care : We actually deliver people\u2019s medication , but we can either only put \u201cnot specified\u201d for the contact , or \u201csupervised medication , \u201d which is unfair to the client 7 , and doesn\u2019t bear the cost information to the service . \u2026 By cataloguing all of these contacts , you could look at the cost implications and see if there were other ways in which you could change that , and how the service could mature . ( CPN , SW Outreach ) Here , the user also suggests that the potential of the PiMS system to inform and improve patient care by supporting evidence - based practice , and to assist the Trust in financial control , is being ignored . While some teams , such as the SW Outreach Team , felt that the menu options were inadequate to categorize the crisis management and emergency call - out work they did , other teams felt that PiMS did not reflect the \u201ceveryday stuff\u201d they did with patients and that the system was weighted toward activity : If things are going well for a patient , that\u2019s a good thing . But it doesn\u2019t mean you do nothing , it\u2019s more a question of ongoing support . There\u2019s no menu option for this . It\u2019s maintaining contact more than anything else , so you can spot any approaching problems early on , and perhaps do something to mitigate them by early intervention . PiMS assumes you should be doing something to the patient , rather than just being with them . ( CPN , SW CPN Team ) Some users resorted to picking the option that seemed nearest , since clear definitions of terms were often not available , and took refuge in the menu\u2019s ambiguity , while deploring it . One CPN described the category \u201cproblem resolution\u201d as \u201cvery vague , very general , very broad spectrum , \u201d so that \u201cagoraphobia desensitization therapy\u201d and \u201csorting out the electric bill\u201d could end up represented as the same thing in the system , since both aimed at solving specific problems , albeit at immensely different levels of involvement . However , even users within the same team , with similar caseloads and work practices , did not always agree on the terminology to use for PiMS : \u201c\u2026 between the five of us , I might say it\u2019s problem resolution , but someone else might say it\u2019s treatment\u2026Or is it therapy ? \u201d ( Charge Nurse , NE Area ) . 7 By implying that the patient could not be trusted to take the medication without supervision . 236 Anderson et al . 8 Report to be presented to the judge ( PF ) in court cases where , for example , addi - tional psychiatric evidence is called for . 9 To a specific employment program . 10 To certain kinds of medication and their side effects .

You would be assessing the things that you know are of importance . If you know that somebody\u2019s depressed , you\u2019re not going to go and assess them for being hypermanic . So you\u2019re not going to do a full assessment . So I just don\u2019t think that the information is truly representative of what we\u2019re doing . I suppose we\u2019re having to fit what we\u2019re doing , round about these 2 or 3 words on a line really . ( Team Leader , SW CPN Team ) . As a last resort , some PiMS users had taken to entering their contact purpose as \u201cNot Specified\u201d because having searched the pull - down list , they had failed to find an option they felt adequately reflected their everyday practice . This ( as of early spring 2002 ) was the point at which the Implementation Group and IS Teams , already concerned about the validity of PiMS data in terms of its completeness and timeliness , started to question the accuracy and dependability of data entered into the system . Their concerns were accentuated by their decision to start using PiMS data as the main basis for BPCT\u2019s monthly Activity Reports to IRD at that time . The in - depth version of this report ( not sent to IRD ) revealed exactly which clinicians or teams were not using the system . Remedial action was planned . The Implementation Group and IS attributed the use of \u201cNot Specified\u201d for Contact Purpose to user laziness , even more so because it was the default option . Correction of data already in PiMS represented an \u201ceasy win\u201d in terms of data quality improvement . 11 They were already sending a monthly Error Report to each Team , detailing individual user errors , which would then have to be corrected by the user . It was decided to add use of \u201cNot Specified\u201d to the error lists , even though the option remained visible on the Contact Purpose and several other similarly contested menus . This offended some users\u2019 sense of rightness of classification and , indeed , of veracity : Now , nobody told us that we couldn\u2019t have a \u201cnot specified\u201d outcome and of course the outcomes are quite general and not specific to our service , mental health or whatever , so lots of them \u2026 they\u2019re not relevant . Well , none of those are relevant so I\u2019m better recording \u2026 rather than recording something that\u2019s not true , is to say I\u2019m not going to specify an outcome on that . ( Team Leader , SW Area Outreach ) 11 At that point , easier than compelling non - users to use the system . 238 Anderson et al . The first interim fieldwork report brought this mismatch of views to the attention of the Implementation Group , raising the issue of classification , and the need to produce more or less stable but workable definitions of categories of clinical activity by consultants , nurses , and therapists ( Hardstone 2002 ) . It stressed that research data gathered from interviews and observation showed that \u201cNot Specified\u201d was the menu option of last resort , and not the easy way out , and focused on the Contact Purpose menu because its use was at that point mandatory within PiMS , while those for Diagnosis or Warnings and Alerts were not ( although equally contested in different ways ) . Fieldwork had also revealed that existing mechanisms for user feedback were not working effectively , with the result that the Implementation Group was largely unaware of users\u2019 conceptual and practical difficulties with \u201cContact Purpose . \u201d Many teams in BPCT did not know the PiMS User Group existed , or how to get in contact with it to make their views heard . The Group itself was poorly attended by \u201creal\u201d users ; those who attended were a far from representative cross section , having self - selected prior to roll - out , perhaps because of an interest in IT ; and the Group tended to run to agendas that provided no space for clinical users to articulate their concerns about PiMS . 9 . 3 . 4 The Evolution of the Contact Purpose Menu At this stage , our research explored the history and evolution of the Contact Purpose menu to find out how it had developed 38 options , yet still confused and failed to satisfy users . This led the Implementation Group simultaneously to address this issue in practice , including attempting to ( re ) establish definitions of the existing menu terms . During configuration prior to roll - out , BPCT had requested HealthCo to migrate parts of the Contact menu from CIS across to PiMS . Many of these options had been placed in the PiMS Contact Purpose submenu , which only allowed one purpose to be selected . By contrast , CIS had allowed users to select more than one option , which they had found useful . PiMS users made unfavorable comparisons with the affordances of the previous systems , such as CIS , which did not represent practice in quite such a reduced way : And the other thing is that you can only pick one thing out of the list . Now , we\u2019d do somebody\u2019s depot 12 but you don\u2019t go to somebody\u2019s house and 12 A \u201cdepot\u201d is an intramuscular injection of slow - release medication , the effects of which last for about a week . This is particularly useful in the case of clients who , for whatever reason , have difficulty complying with a pill - based regime . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 239 purely do their depot . You go to their house and you monitor their mental health , do their depot , you might give them a bit of support , a bit of counsel - ling , but there isn\u2019t the scope for that . It really just \u2026 you can only identify one thing that you\u2019ve done \u2026 and the list isn\u2019t that great . I preferred the list on the Community Information System . You could pick as many as you want , or up to 4 , I think \u2026 And it had things like \u201cSupportive Counselling\u201d in it . It was a very , very long list . The one on PiMS is not terribly long . ( Team Leader , SW CPN Team ) PiMS Contact Purposes had been drawn from five CIS menus : Most of the migrated options within the CIS menus had accompanying definitions that the PiMS Implementation Group could send to users as a reminder . It turned out that even in CIS , the definition of \u201cproblem resolution\u201d could indeed encompass help with utility bills or agoraphobia . However , the five menus above represented different aspects of care , and none was exactly equivalent in meaning to \u201cContact Purpose . \u201d Contact Purpose itself appeared ill - defined if commonsensical\u2014although the Group was clear that overall purpose was not the same as a specific intervention . Hence , from the outset , the PiMS Contact Purpose menu was a conflation of incommensurable options from a variety of sources , and users could only choose one ; no wonder they were perplexed . More Contact Purpose menu options had been added since roll - out by user request . At this stage this process did not seem to have been system - atic : It was a case of who shouted loudest . During the early phases of roll - out , users in one particular , large specialist service asked for several addi - tions to the menu , as they felt that the options supplied failed to reflect their team\u2019s activities . The PiMS project team granted this request because the service concerned was large and vocal ( hence powerful ) and had not previously kept \u201cgood records , \u201d in the expectation that this would help achieve user buy - in and ensure compliance in use of the system . However , for various reasons this had not happened . In fact , this service had not in - put PiMS data at all , nor had it been keeping summary manual records in a form suitable for computer input . Other smaller , less prestigious teams , unhappy with the Contact Purpose menu options , had also discussed pro - posed additions to reflect their activities . These had been sent to the PiMS \u2022 reason for care ( medication ; treatment ) , \u2022 intervention ( assessment ; health promotion ; medication ; case conference ) , \u2022 care packages ( assessment ) , \u2022 care aims ( assessment ; maintenance ; problem resolution ; palliative and bereavement care ; health promotion ) , \u2022 contributing factors ( epilepsy ; challenging behavior ) . 240 Anderson et al . Team , but had been lost without a trace . That nothing had been done to address these teams\u2019 requests was not perceived by their members as un - toward . From June 2001 , all requests for additions to the system had been logged and a procedure put in place for dealing with them . In particular , additions had to be \u201cowned\u201d by a team , and they had to be defined . Two new contact purposes had been added since then : \u201cparole report\u201d ( mental health examination of a prisoner at the request of the Scottish Prison Ser - vice , on a par with \u201cPF report\u201d ) and \u201crelapse prevention , \u201d another request from the large specialist service , which was still not using PiMS . In May 2002 , the Implementation Group agreed that the Contact Pur - pose menu was \u201cout of control\u201d and action was needed . The possibility of creating sub - submenus reflecting each team\u2019s activities in their own termi - nology that would map to a reduced Contact Purpose submenu had finally to be rejected as technically infeasible . The issue was raised at a meeting of the User Group to elicit suggestions for dealing with the situation . One proposal was \u201cJust cut it down to 10 choices , and let them get on with it\u201d ( medical consultant ) , which was felt to be unworkable at that stage , as it might further upset many users . The PiMS Systems Administrator then used the analysis software re - flexively to produce a report on use of each Contact Purpose category from roll - out in April 2001 to June 2002 . This was illuminating in many re - spects . Out of nearly 200 , 000 patient contacts during the period , 80 % had been allocated to 6 menu options ( representing just 16 % of the 38 catego - ries ) . Fewer than 1 % of contacts were described as \u201cNot Specified , \u201d which strongly suggested that concern over misuse of this category had been overstated , even accounting for reclassification as a result of the Error Re - ports . Some categories had hardly been used , including \u201cepilepsy . \u201d When the team and individual detail behind the report was viewed , HCPs select - ing this option were found to include those known not to deal with epilep - tic patients . Instead , they belonged to teams that had many \u201cfollow - up\u201d contacts . \u201cFollow - up\u201d succeeds \u201cepilepsy\u201d in the alphabetic menu , raising the possibility that some clinical users lacked mouse control skills . 13 Members of the PiMS Implementation Group and the fieldworker began ( separately ) to examine the menu classification , in order to amalgamate similar options into a slightly smaller number of categories . It was initially considered that this could be safely undertaken . However , when this was discussed at an Implementation Group meeting , it was found to be 13 A point borne out in concurrent fieldwork observations of computer training in an acute NHS Trust . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 241 problematic , as there were diverse interpretations even within the Group as to which instances should be included in each category , and hence on what basis to amalgamate them . The incommensurability of categories became very apparent , and managers also realized that basic definitions of contact purposes were either unclear , contested , or absent . Hence , a Group mem - ber was delegated to seek and tabulate definitions for every existing con - tact purpose . Only two , \u201cfollow - up\u201d and \u201cdischarge , \u201d had nationally agreed definitions , so it was up to BPCT to reflect its local practice ( s ) in the rest . On further consideration , it was realized that neither \u201cfollow - up\u201d nor \u201cdischarge\u201d was actually contact purposes , the former being a \u201cContact Type\u201d and the latter a \u201cContact Outcome . \u201d However , at the time , it was deemed infeasible to remove them from the menu , as both were well - used , and their removal might have substantially increased again the number of contacts of which the purpose was \u201cNot Specified . \u201d Teams were asked to decide at team level which of their activities trans - lated to which contact purposes , to agree team - level definitions of the lat - ter , and to feed back their decisions to the PiMS Implementation Group , which decided that , for the time being , it could accommodate this kind of local variety within the system , \u201cjust as long as we know what each team means\u201d ( Data Protection Manager ) , and could map it back onto a more global classification scheme , for use at Trust - wide and external reporting levels . Teams that undertook this exercise found it useful , as it helped them restate and clarify the work that their team members did . Members of multi - disciplinary teams felt more cohesive , while better appreciating the variety of tasks undertaken by the different professional groups repre - sented within the team . The exercise also resulted in new contact purposes , such as \u201cDeliver Medication\u201d and \u201cPhlebotomy\u201d , 14 being added to the menu , as Team Leaders realized the difficulties members were experienc - ing with fitting their everyday activities into the system and made formal requests for menu additions to the Implementation Group . These were im - plemented , and so the Contact Purpose menu continued to expand . How - ever , new team members were not always made aware of the recently es - tablished definitions and so made their own , sometimes idiosyncratic , decisions about how to categorize their activities using the menu . In spring 2003 , the Implementation Group decided to attempt amalga - mation and standardization of the team - level definitions , and a working party was convened for several sessions over the summer to take this for - ward . The new group was composed of representatives from the various generalist geographical areas of BPCT and specialist services , and also 14 The taking of patients\u2019 blood for testing . 242 Anderson et al . included a wide range of professions , and some not previously involved , such as therapists and counselors . Members of the group also varied in ex - perience , and relative novices , such as Student CPNs , attended . It proved problematic for participants to agree on any but the widest definitions of menu terms , since there were almost as many definitions as there were rep - resentatives . Discussions were sometimes heated , highlighting inter - professional differences and hierarchies . It was also difficult for group members to arrive at brief definitions of menu terms in the first place , as experienced practitioners could always think of exceptions to the \u201crules . \u201d Those who found it easiest to define menu terms , such as students , tended to have the least practical experience , both of mental health practice and of the organization . Eventually the working party was disbanded , and in the autumn the Implementation Group proposed a more radical solution . Trust workers were informed that from December 2003 , the Contact Purpose menu would be reduced to three options : Assessment , Treatment , and Support , plus the default \u201cNot Specified\u201d ( which could not be removed from the system ) . At first , there was little reaction from users . HCPs had ceased to see Contact Purpose as clinically relevant ( and , perhaps , worth consideration ) , as it did not meet their information recording or retrieval needs . In addition , more specific modules that were seen as clinically useful , such as assessments and care plans , had been added to PiMS . This made the Contact Purpose menu much less of an area for clinical debate . Moreover , users\u2019 attention had shifted to other parts of the system , such as the ( even ) more contentious classification systems of \u201cDiagnosis\u201d / \u201cSignificant condition\u201d and \u201cWarnings\u201d / \u201cAlerts , \u201d which were as yet only partially implemented in PiMS and not mandatory . 15 However , some teams , including the large specialist service that had ini - tially been very concerned that the Contact Purpose menu did not meet its specific clinical recording needs , then began to request additions to the new abbreviated menu , on the grounds that they needed finer detail in or - der to make an effective case for the future resourcing of their services . These potential requirements were discussed with teams , but not imple - mented within the menu . For some months , it seemed as though the issues 15 For various reasons , \u201cdiagnosis\u201d raises not just the usual issues in classification ( see Bowker and Star 1999 , for a discussion of the International Classification of Diseases ) but also , in the case of BPCT\u2019s multi - disciplinary mental health service teams , the prospect of finding a way to get different diagnosis classifica - tion schemes to co - exist simultaneously within PiMS \u2015 with psychologists using ICD10 , psychiatrists using DSM , and nursing staff entering nursing diagnoses . \u201cWarnings\u201d and \u201calerts\u201d are subjects for debate within BPCT because of stigma and Data Protection Act issues . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 243 of Contact Purpose had been resolved . Then , during the summer of 2004 , BPCT\u2019s internal Information Services team remarked that use of the \u201cNot Specified\u201d default option had been rising significantly\u2014since the menu was no longer seen as clinically important , HCPs in general had , perhaps , become more inclined to click the first option they encountered , which was the default . It was decided to tackle the issue with a combination of in - creased emphasis on Error Reports , user retraining , and meetings with middle management ( Team Leaders and above ) to stress to them the value for BPCT as a whole of accurate administrative information . At the same time , new funding was made available for teams to deploy additional cleri - cal support staff to enter patient data into PiMS , on the grounds that clini - cal users had , over time , proved unsuitable to undertake their own data en - try into the system . This reversed the major change in the division of labor for information recording that had accompanied ( and played a part in cost - justifying ) the initial roll - out of the system within BPCT . Through an investigation of the origins , history , and evolution of the Contact Purpose submenu , the researchers and the PiMS Implementation Group came closer to an understanding of how the current situation had arisen and what actions could be taken to address it . Lessons learned and methods used were applied to the reconfiguration of other operational and mandatory PiMS menus in BPCT , such as \u201cOutcome , \u201d \u201cType of contact . \u201d and \u201cIntervention . \u201d However , more subtle lessons could be learned from the case of the Contact Purpose menu about reasons for the failure of PiMS to function as a shared , common resource . From the outset of implementation , although the first project manager had championed the new system as serving the needs of both clinical and administrative users , it had rapidly become clear that this was almost entirely an administrative system . Both the data entered and most of the reports extracted served the needs of Trust\u2019s Information Services team and , through this , the Information Services Division of the Scottish Executive . Clinical users perceived little or no benefit for their daily activities from PiMS , nor were they able to use it to improve patient care . Moreover , areas of the system that appeared to have some clinical content and relevance , such as the Contact Purpose menu , proved to be problematic because of the heterogeneity of professional knowledge and practice , and difficulties agreeing common classifications between groups . Rendering menu categories sufficiently simple for administrative purposes also had the effect of making them meaningless to many clinical users , and led to the entry , for various reasons , of invalid data . This in turn made statistics derived from system data unreliable . At the same time , a menu that satisfied most clinical users was also cumbersome and created data accuracy issues for administrators . 244 Anderson et al . 9 . 4 Discussion The case study illustrates very clearly the obstacles to the creation of a common information space or boundary object capable coordinating different \u201ccommunities of practice\u201d ( Lave and Wenger 1991 ) . Different occupational groups , teams , and individuals have evolved their own , more or less idiosyncratic terms to suit their particular purposes , traditions , and practices . Attempts to bring these all on board into the new system may lead to convoluted and inconsistent classification schema ; conversely , harmonization efforts may be at a cost in terms of how useful and dependable the shared data are seen to be for different groups . In the process of accommodation between these perspectives , some \u201cusers\u201d are better able to represent their views ( for example , government sponsors with their statutory reporting requirements ) than others . Earlier accounts of medical records as boundary objects have described contexts in which there were substantial gulfs between the different communities of practice involved : \u201cmost physicians never get to see the coding forms used by the coders ; most record administration coders know little of the elaborate nursing coding schemes ; most nurses primarily draw on the nursing record during their work\u201d ( Berg and Bowker 1997 ) . There are two significant differences between the situation they are describing and PiMS as implemented in BPCT . First , it is intended by BPCT that all clinical staff\u2014consultants ( or their secretaries ) , nurses , therapists , social workers\u2014should input their own activity data into PiMS at team level , rather than relying on central Medical Records staff to act as mediators between themselves and the act of coding . This forces HCPs to attend to the rightness of the codings that they have to use for data input , with the mismatches bound to provoke debate about definitions and classifications , particularly with regard to hitherto ill - defined nursing ( Bowker and Star 1999 ) and other therapeutic work . In particular , debate is likely to center on those classifications and codings considered to be of greatest clinical significance , such as contact purpose . Diagnoses and warnings and alerts are also contested classifications in PiMS , and their evolution will be addressed in future work as system implementation proceeds . Second , BPCT\u2019s mental health services have been reorganized into multi - disciplinary teams , and patients are referred to the care of the most appropriate practitioner within the team , who is not always a consultant . 16 16 This occurred prior to the roll - out of PiMS . Connections between this organiza - tional change and the implementation of the new system do not yet appear to Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 245 In fact , some patients may never see a consultant . All BPCT mental health team members draw on and contribute to the \u201cmulti - disciplinary case notes , \u201d which comprise the whole team\u2019s notes on a patient , regardless of the individual members\u2019 occupational status . This represents a fairly radi - cal departure from traditional concepts of the divisions of labor surround - ing health care , and is as yet not well understood by some nonclinical parts of the Trust that receive activity reports based on PiMS data , such as Fi - nance , Performance and Planning , which still see the consultant\u2019s activities as paramount , with nursing and other clinical work being merely \u201cincluded in the price . \u201d When designing and configuring an information system for use in a multi - disciplinary environment , menu options and their underlying classification schemes will need to reflect that diversity of practice . For example , teamwork greatly facilitates alignment of classification practices within ( co - located ) professions , though not overcoming differences be - tween geographically or functionally / organizationally remote groups . The medical records on PiMS in BPCT do , indeed , serve as infrastructure and are intended to be interoperable between different organizational communities of practice . However , they have to do this without the intermediation of a Medical Records function at the initial data input stage . The raw data are now to be input by diverse clinical teams who are also potential end users of analyses of that data . As such , they have a strong and partial interest in the medical record reflecting their practice in terms meaningful to them , and perhaps little interest in what other organizational communities might require . Problems of user commitment to information recording are heightened by BPCT\u2019s initial emphasis on fulfilling the data requirements of bodies external to the Trust , and the failure to implement any reporting facility that would enable clinicians to interrogate the data themselves . At present , members of the PiMS Implementation Group are the multi - disciplinary mediators that perform subsequent work on the record , translating data in the system into reports and analyses that are meaningful to clinicians , Trust managers , and external bodies such as IRD . The perceived relevance of information on the system may also be of cru - cial importance , since those who benefit from timely and accurate informa - tion may not be the same as those who have to work to put the information onto the system . Some common understanding of the purpose of the infor - mation and consensus about the value of the system is crucial to maintaining the commitment of organization members to the often demanding require - ments of the system\u2014necessary to ensuring the dependability ( accuracy , have been made by all BPCT\u2019s managers and nonclinical staff , although PiMS explicitly supports multi - disciplinary working . 246 Anderson et al . timeliness ) of information the system contains , a finding that mirrors ear - lier experience with integrated systems such as computer - aided production management ( CAPM ) ( Webster and Williams 1993 ) . In terms of methods for IT systems design and implementation , the case study points up the significance of apparently minor configuration details , such as the design and naming of database fields translated on screen as seemingly innocent pull - down menus . Addressing this may be particularly ( but not exclusively ) challenging in complex , heterogeneous , public sector organizations , such as the NHS , where there are a large number of differentially powerful , overlapping , and non - mutually exclusive communities of practice . Classification systems of immense professional , organizational , and political importance may be represented by such menus . These will evolve as implementation proceeds , and thereafter over the life of the system , and will probably need to be reconfigured iteratively . It is unlikely that such menus can be designed \u201cright first time , \u201d and related reconfiguration work need not be taken to indicate failure on the part of system suppliers , designers , or implementers . Rather , it should be seen as yet another aspect of the \u201cnormal\u201d process of implementation , with its attendant \u201clearning processes . \u201d Our empirical evidence suggests , as does some of the classification literature ( Bowker and Star 1999 ) , that when a classification scheme is being developed , one should expect the number of categories to expand significantly before it can be reduced . Effective mechanisms for obtaining feedback from a full range of users should be in place . Care should also be taken to match like with like classifications when migrating menu options from legacy or previous systems , particularly where the database structure is different , or menus are being aggregated . The picture that emerges from the case study is one where practice prior to PiMS has relied upon diverse , distinct , and locally meaningful classifications and category labels that emerged and had been closely tailored to the needs of specific communities of practice within the Trust . While the information management practices are very locally meaningful , they also relate to the overall practice of medical care . Introducing centralized information systems such as PiMS is a difficult undertaking as they have an in - built tendency to strip away local meaning , replacing it with externally defined categories ( whether reflecting outcomes of some formal classification exercise , the information required by particular influential actors [ government ; clinicians ] or a schema contained within packaged software ) . In order for such a system to work , local interests have to be enrolled to support such universalities and keep them functional through day - to - day interpretation ( Timmermans and Berg 1997 ) . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 247 This draws attention to the processes whereby local concerns and particular distinctions and practices are catered for within the overall system , and the extent to which the gulfs can be bridged . In the case of the Contacts Purpose menu , a complex and difficult accommodation process has only just begun . One issue concerns the heterogeneity of the clinical teams and how their different purposes can be accommodated . However , this is not a simple process of articulation and alignment of interests . We have already alluded to the politics of categorization : Agreement will necessarily prioritize the information / classificatory purposes of some groups over others ; a negotiation made more perilous by the uneven access to decision making and status of the different groups involved within the Trust and beyond . However , the politics of classification are more rather complex\u2014and here we differ with the somewhat heroic accounts of the politics of classification advanced by Bowker and Star ( 1999 ) \u2014insofar as the potential uses of the information on the system , evidently manifold , are not yet reliably mapped out or known . The implications of recording some particular practices and not others are hard to assess . This brings us back to long - debated questions about how information infrastructures can cater for the needs of future , as \u2013 yet - unknown , users and uses . The PiMS project is still underway\u2014and we plan , through longitudinal study , to go beyond the currently available snapshot studies ( and historical reconstructions ) and gain a deeper understanding of how these issues are addressed over time as systems bed down and become widely used , as uses emerge and systems and practices evolve . In this way we also hope to obtain insights into the technical and organizational means adopted to remedy these problems . 9 . 5 Conclusions This case study , in line with a growing body of research into the design and implementation of IT systems , highlights the problems inherent in introducing software systems that require ( or attempt to bring about ) the standardization of hitherto diverse , local practices ( Ellingsen and Monteiro 2000 ; Heeks et al . , 1999 ) . In the case of PiMS , the Trust management and the software supplier seem to have assumed that a stable , organizational - wide community of practice could be conjured up through the agency of a software artifact : the standardized classification scheme and associated set of category names inscribed within the PiMS system as user interface menu structures , entries , and dialogue field names . 248 Anderson et al . Our case study illustrates how the work of constructing PiMS as a common information space is an ongoing achievement as members of dif - ferent communities of practice learn to work together . To be successful , PiMS must achieve both local and global meaning . It must adequately provide for the work practices of the multiple clinical teams and services in satisfying their internal and possibly heterogeneous needs for record keeping and coordination ; it must generate a sufficient degree of alignment between contexts to satisfy the purposes of characterizing activity within the Trust as a whole . Moreover , the desired alignment around , e . g . , contact purposes must be given time and support to evolve as the implications of service integration goals and more rapid information flows and new forms of accountability are experienced and understood by the system\u2019s numerous users . Of course , there are problems that must be resolved if PiMS is to fulfill the expectations surrounding it . We observe , for example , the feeling among health service teams that frontline clinical and care workers are being taxed with generating the data , but that it is the hospital resource managers who benefit . The issue of what kinds of incentives different stakeholders require to encourage them to greater alignment of practices and understanding is , of course , a recurrent theme wherever new information systems cross boundaries between professional and / or organizational groups . A common failing is that the benefits seem to many stakeholders to be unfairly apportioned , with the consequence that the system becomes a site of contention rather than cooperation . In the case of PiMS , we note two specific issues that are indicative of a fundamental obstacle to successful and meaningful information integration . The first is that healthcare service teams have so far found the activity re - ports and summaries that PiMS provides to be inadequate . In particular , they find it difficult to relate these abstract accounts of their work to their own local understandings , making the use of activity reports and summaries as a record of work problematic at the local level . The second issue is uncertainty among the Trust healthcare service teams as to how the broader organiza - tional aims of PiMS\u2014specifically , the Trust\u2019s desire for greater accuracy in the allocation and management of resources\u2014will play out . Resources are notoriously scarce in healthcare , with many sectors working at the limit of their capacity and struggling with long waiting lists . Resource allocation , therefore , is a matter of huge concern to all Trust service teams . Each service team is concerned that their levels of activity are accurately recorded and that Trust managers then draw the appropriate resource implications . The problem for the service teams is that they do not yet fully understand how the information on contact purposes will be used , nor the rules of the re - source allocation decision - making \u201cgame . \u201d The result is that the teams have Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 249 been unable to form a clear idea of how to use PiMS as a mechanism for re - cipiently designing accounts of their work for others so as to ensure what they would regard was as fair outcome for themselves . What these two issues serve to remind us is that information is always created in a specific locality where it acquires a local meaning , and that work has to be done to achieve universality and then to interpret it appropriately within a different context ( Berg and Timmermans 2000 ; Timmermans and Berg 1997 ) . For a common information space to work , translations have to take place that first de - situate information and thus achieve universality and then resituate information in order to make it useful for specific actors within their own locales . It would be mistaken , however , to conclude that a useful and usable system will not eventually emerge from the PiMS project . We must remember that the Trust is still in the early stages of the transition toward an integrated IT system . In several ways , the Trust seems to be replicating the experience of manufacturing and financial service organizations that were going down this road a decade ago ( Fincham et al . 1994 ) . Public sector organizations could learn from this previous experience that implementation and reconfiguration are often complex and lengthy processes and should be anticipated and resourced accordingly . This experience also underlines how information integration is an iterative , evolutionary , and ongoing process ; subsequent implementations may prove more successful than the first , given the extensive effort required for achieving a practicable level of alignment of meanings and practices ( Webster and Williams 1993 ) . The question is what measures can be taken to best support this change process . The weakest claim we feel that we can make is that improved awareness of these issues ( and a more critical assessment of supplier rhetoric ) may help organizations to minimize these problems when implementing such systems , as well as helping identify the areas where difficulties can be expected to arise . In the course of our involvement in this case as action researchers ( following our initial period solely as observers ) , we have drawn attention to the ways in which the mechanisms designed to involve users across diverse communities were not working effectively . However , there are inherent tensions and tradeoffs underpinning the projects of classification and of creating a common information space . In considering more concrete measures , questions still remain about which kinds of intervention may prove most effective\u2014between , for ex - ample , those geared toward technical change and those geared toward or - ganizational innovation . We outline below two possible and related ave - nues for advance , one revolving around a more detailed treatment of the constituent activities involved in classification and categorization work 250 Anderson et al . and how it can be supported ; the other revolving around a vision of a more devolved socio - technical architecture for information integration . Analysis of the data we have gathered has already identified three distinctive kinds of activity involved in deploying a classification within an organizational setting : Each of these different activities engages with different groups of practice to varying extents , and these groups have different concerns and support needs . In building support tools and procedures , we therefore need to consider which activity we are supporting . Beyond this , however , what is clearly essential is that there be mechanisms in place for feedback between the groups involved in these activities , and that these mechanisms are themselves set within an overall strategy for evolving both the IT system and the work practices that it supports . The evidence of our study is that , in the case of the PiMS project , these feedback mechanisms\u2014that is , the Implementation and User Groups\u2014were not adequate for this purpose . The fact that it fell to us , through our research , to draw attention to how PiMS was actually being used and to articulate user concerns , is clear evidence of the failure of the formal mechanisms . A simple lesson from this would be for IT project teams to deploy members to observe the use of a new IT system in detail , perhaps using techniques similar to those employed in ethnographic research . Elsewhere in this book , we discuss how this kind of approach might be implemented and incorporated into IT systems design and development work ( Hartswood et al . , this volume ) . Beyond methodological issues , the idea of evolving IT systems also raises important questions about the fit of integration strategy and systems architectures : Not all systems architectures are equal in this respect . In the case of PiMS , we have an example of an integration strategy that is based upon the implementation of a \u201clocalised universal\u201d ( Timmermans and Berg 1997 ) : a large - scale , standardized software package being tailored and re - shaped to fit local practices . We have seen how this process of localization is conditioned by technical constraints in the form of the PiMS package\u2019s 1 . Constructing the classification : This work involves both amalgamating the local classifications that arise within the healthcare service teams , and , at the level of the overall classification , of considering example cases and how they fit within it . 2 . Using the classification : This is the practice of classifying cases as they arise in the course of everyday work . 3 . Analyzing and auditing information within classes : This is the work involved in constructing statistical analyses of the classified data and verifying its correctness through , for example , quality assurance procedures . Down in the ( Data ) base ( ment ) 251 limited support for local configuration and also by the project team\u2019s ap - preciation of the benefits of standardization in terms of minimizing the subsequent support effort\u2014in other words , we see an example of the clas - sic package paradox ( Brady et al . 1992 ) . We have argued elsewhere that IT departments should , instead , consider the merits of a strategy for information integration based on \u201cuniversalized locals\u201d ( Hartswood et al . 2001 ) , creat - ing a common information space as a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of multiple instances of local systems ( Ellingsen and Monteiro 2000 ) . In this approach , using some kind of data dictionary mapping service , locally produced and managed in - formation is translated for other localities and users as required , but with - out the need for organization - wide standardization . This approach has a number of advantages : \u2022 Information is organized and managed in locally meaningful ways , and so the usefulness at the source is maximized . \u2022 Translations involve explicit contracts , so information providers remain aware of who uses their information and in what ways . \u2022 Systems continue to be locally designed and evolved\u2014and so reflect the culture and purposes of the groups who use them . In the context of the Trust , a project based upon this strategy would see the implementation of a mini - PiMS within each health service team as a first stage toward an organization - wide information infrastructure . Only once these have been successfully deployed would the second , integrative stage begin . Several benefits follow from this . First , information is organized and managed in locally meaningful ways , and thus the usefulness at the source is maximized , ensuring local buy - in . Local adaptations are possible and remain local . Second , decisions about the information needs of non - local users are deferred to the latest possible time . Because translations involve explicit contracts , local information owners remain aware of non - local users , their information needs , and how they use the information so provided . Third , the costs of translations are borne by those non - local users who will benefit from accessing the information and not by the local producers . Finally , this approach naturally allows for practices of information production and consumption to evolve gradually and with minimal danger of disruptive effects . Such benefits may need to be weighed against concerns for the wider organizational dependability of information , where its production remains subject to local practices and standards . This underlines the importance of maintaining adequate information audit and verification procedures . The PiMS project is still in its early stages in terms of the bedding down of the system within the Trust and the development of attendant classification work ( let alone its extension to other sites ) . We will be continuing this study 252 Anderson et al . longitudinally , allowing detailed insight into how these ongoing issues are ad - dressed by those involved , in terms of categorization efforts , coordination work practices , and system enhancements . This will involve more extensive feedback and discussion of our research findings with the array of interested parties within BPCT and beyond . In this way , we expect to be able to elabo - rate in more detail and assess the possible measures and tools by which evolu - tion in information infrastructures may be more effectively supported .

Christensen 3 , Yoed . N . Kenett 4 and Roger E . Beaty 5 Education is central to the acquisition of knowledge , such as when children learn new concepts . It is unknown , however , whether educational differences impact not only what concepts children learn , but how those concepts come to be represented in semantic memory \u2014 a system that supports higher cognitive functions , such as creative thinking . Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds \u2014 Montessori and traditional , matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence \u2014 to examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking . We \ufb01 nd that children experiencing Montessori education show a more \ufb02 exible semantic network structure ( high connectivity / short paths between concepts , less modularity ) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests . The \ufb01 ndings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions , including creative thinking . npj Science of Learning ( 2021 ) 6 : 35 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41539 - 021 - 00113 - 8 INTRODUCTION Early experience is of paramount importance for later cognitive and emotional outcomes 1 . In this period of high brain plasticity 2 , 3 , children \u2019 s knowledge is acquired ef \ufb01 ciently through statistical learning 4 , 5 and it is signi \ufb01 cantly shaped by interactions with the environment 6 . Despite the importance of experience on semantic knowledge ( i . e . , 7 ) , few researches have focused on the role of school education in in \ufb02 uencing not only how children acquire new knowledge , but also how they come to represent knowledge in long - term ( semantic ) memory . The organization of semantic memory plays a key role in higher cognitive functions , such as creative thinking 8 . In the present research , we apply network science methods to investigate how different educational approaches , namely traditional and Montessori approaches , shape 5 \u2013 12 - year - old children \u2019 s internal knowledge representation in semantic memory ( i . e . , concept learning ) and their ability to think \ufb02 exibly and creatively . Montessori and traditional education can both be of high quality , but their approaches differ with respect to concept learning \u2014 an important feature of cognitive development sup - porting the acquisition of new vocabulary and crystallized knowledge . Montessori education focuses on self - directed and uninterrupted learning activities that children perform within multi - age classes 9 , 10 . Children in these classes routinely engage in interdisciplinary , discovery - based work to learn new concepts ( e . g . , draw the outline of the continents , write their names , and classify them according to their population size ) , such as conducting experiments in and out of the class , often with minimal ( but guiding ) feedback from teachers . According to the Swiss educational plan , traditional education focuses on teacher - directed learning activities , introducing successively different topics ( e . g . , language , writing , geography , math ) that children perform within single - age classes . Children in these classes are asked to learn and memorize concepts ( i . e . , rote learning ) , knowledge on which they are regularly tested and evaluated with grades ( starting from 6 years of age ) . When comparing Montessori and traditional educational approaches , Montessori classes have been shown to promote improved academic outcomes , socio - emotional learning , and divergent and / or con - vergent creativity 11 \u2013 15 . Such effects raise questions about how educational experiences shape children \u2019 s fundamental cognitive processes , such as concept learning . Environmental interaction plays an essential role in how children \ufb01 rst learn about words and concepts 7 . For example , parents \u2019 socioeconomic level is tightly related to preschoolers \u2019 vocabulary level 16 , primarily until around the age of six 17 . As the child develops , the experience within the environment assumes an important part in the continuation of concept learning 18 . Indeed , semantic memory shows a 1 . 6 fold increase across elementary school years , with ~ 3200 root words being acquired between the second and the \ufb01 fth grades 19 . During this period , the child learns not only the root word and its meaning , but how these words relate to other words , establishing deep knowledge representation 20 . During this crucial period of 6 to 12 years , the child encodes on average 800 \u2013 900 new concepts a year , representing the building blocks of knowledge that form an interconnected structure in semantic memory 21 . Individual differences in semantic representation are known to impact many important cognitive abilities ( e . g . , creative thinking ) by in \ufb02 uencing how knowledge is retrieved from memory 22 . In recent years , a new \ufb01 eld of cognitive network science has prompted a paradigm shift in the study of higher cognitive processes 23 , 24 . Cognitive network methods can be used to estimate the organization of concepts in semantic memory . For example , using a simple verbal \ufb02 uency task , where participants name as many words as they can for one given category in 1 min ( e . g . , foods ) , it is now possible to estimate an individual \u2019 s knowledge representation using computational network science tools 25 . Semantic network analyses depict each concept ( name ) as a node , and relations between them as edges . Thus , the less 1 Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology , Lausanne University Hospital ( CHUV ) , University of Lausanne ( UNIL ) , Lausanne , Switzerland . 2 Center for Biomedical Imaging ( CIBM ) , Lausanne , Switzerland . 3 Department of Neurology , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , USA . 4 Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management , Technion \u2014 Israel Institute of Technology , Haifa , Israel . 5 Department of Psychology , Pennsylvania State University , Philadelphia , PA , USA . \u2709 email : solange . denervaud @ unil . ch www . nature . com / npjscilearn Published in partnership with The University of Queensland 1234567890 ( ) : , ; related the concepts , the longer the edges ( e . g . , pear and avocado vs . pear and apple ) , but also the slower the participant will be to report their relationship 24 . Network science measures can provide insight about differ - ences in semantic network structure . For example , network measures can quantify whether concepts tend to be more isolated or closely related to others ( clustering coef \ufb01 cient ; CC ) , whether information \ufb02 ow is more ef \ufb01 cient ( average shortest path length ; ASPL ) , or whether concepts \u2019 integration is rigid vs . \ufb02 exible modularity ; Q ; 24 . Beyond simply representing semantic memory , network science tools allow researchers to study the psychological and behavioral consequences of different memory structures . For example , adults with a more ef \ufb01 cient semantic network structure \u2014 characterized by high connectivity ( higher CC , lower Q ) and short path lengths between concepts ( lower ASPL ) \u2014 show higher levels of the personality trait openness to experience , i . e . , the tendency to seek out and enjoy novel experiences 25 . Moreover , it has been robustly demonstrated that higher creative individuals ( assessed via self - reported achievement and cognitive measures ) also show this \ufb02 exible network structure , which is likely conducive to creative thinking due to \u201c closer \u201d representation of otherwise \u201c distant \u201d concepts in semantic memory 8 . In contrast , less creative individuals show a more rigid memory structure , marked in part by high modularity of concepts into canonical subcategories in memory ( e . g . , animals ) . Together , these data suggest that a more \ufb02 exible knowledge representation is associated with important outcomes , with likely implications for cognition and behavior across the lifespan . How do concepts come to be represented differently in semantic memory ? And what is the initial source of individual differences in semantic memory structure ? In the present research , we examine one potential but underexplored source of variation : education . As a test case , we focus on children from Montessori classes and compare them to children from traditional classes . To account for a possible selection - bias of private Montessori classes with high pedagogical standards , public traditional classes were selected among high socioeconomic city areas and selected for their high - quality teaching practices ( teachers trained in renowned pedagogical centers ) . Although typically developing children \u2014 from similar socioeconomic backgrounds \u2014 may not show notable differences on tests of short - term retention and cognitive ability , their dynamic knowledge representation may show incremental change over time 26 . Because children from Montessori classes learn through self - directed engagement in naturalistic and interdisciplinary activities , we hypothesize that semantic concept integration would diverge from the more traditional , adult - directed curriculum , in being more enriched ( higher CC ) , interconnected ( shorter ASPL ) , and \ufb02 exible ( lower Q ) . Given the long - term behavioral and cognitive implications associated with memory structure , and based on previous \ufb01 ndings in adults 27 , we speci \ufb01 cally addressed the question of whether variation in semantic memory structure tracks cross - sectional improvements in other cognitive abilities over time , with a focus on creative thinking . According to previous work 11 , 28 , we expect children from Montessori classes to present higher convergent and divergent creative skills than children from traditional classes . For the \ufb01 rst time , we therefore examine whether educational differences shape knowledge representation and corresponding creative abilities . RESULTS Participants We began by testing for potential group differences between children from Montessori and traditional classes . Across gender , age , nonverbal intelligence , and parental SES , no signi \ufb01 cant differences were found , revealing comparable groups ( Table 1 ) . Verbal \ufb02 uency Having established that the two groups were demographically and intellectually similar , we next assessed their performance on the verbal \ufb02 uency task ( animal category ; Table 2 ) . While children experiencing Montessori education produced a similar number of responses ( M = 16 . 4 , SD = 5 . 0 ) than their peers experiencing a more traditional education ( M = 14 . 8 , SD = 5 . 8 ) , they gave more unique responses ( 105 ) than their peers from traditional classes ( 87 ; p = 0 . 023 ) . Of these unique responses , children experiencing Montessori education provided more unique responses that the children experiencing traditional education did not provide ( 37 ) than vice versa ( 19 ) . Creativity assessment Next , we tested whether education in \ufb02 uenced creative thinking ( Table 2 ) . We found that the groups differed on both divergent and convergent creativity tests , with the Montessori sample scoring on average higher ( M div = 9 . 6 , M conv = 5 . 3 ) than the traditional sample ( M div = 7 . 1 , M conv = 2 . 6 ) , t ( 64 ) = 3 . 24 , p = 0 . 02 , d = 0 . 58 , and t ( 64 ) = 7 . 10 , p < 0 . 001 , d = 1 . 74 , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Divergent and convergent creativity scores were positively correlated with the total number of responses on the verbal \ufb02 uency test , r = 0 . 27 , p = 0 . 03 , and r = 0 . 36 , p = 0 . 003 , respec - tively , replicating past work 29 . Network analysis Finally , we estimated the semantic networks of the Montessori and traditional groups ( Fig . 1 ) . The networks were visualized ( Fig . 1 ) using the Cytoscape software 30 . In these 2D visualizations , nodes are represented by the respective circles and edges between them are represented by lines . Since these networks are undirected and weighted , the edges convey symmetrical ( i . e . , bidirectional ) similarities between two nodes . A qualitative inspection of these network visualizations illustrates that the semantic network of the Montessori group is more condensed ( nodes are closer together ) and less modular ( the network has fewer subcomponents ) than the semantic network of the traditional group . To statistically validate our results , we incorporated two complimentary statistical signi \ufb01 cance testing methods . First , we compared the measures of our empirical semantic networks to those of randomly generated networks . Across all three networks , the simulated random network analysis revealed that the empirical network measures ( ASPL , CC , and Q ) for both groups were statistically different from random networks ( all p \u2019 s < 0 . 001 ) . Second , case - wise bootstrap network analyses evaluated the differences in the network measures between both groups ( Fig . 2 ) . An independent - groups t test revealed that the Montessori - schooled children had a signi \ufb01 cantly higher CC ( M = 0 . 707 , Table 1 .

Additionally , the Montessori - schooled children had a signi \ufb01 cantly lower ASPL ( M = 3 . 07 , SD = 0 . 26 ) than the traditional - schooled children ( M = 3 . 12 , SD = 23 ) , t ( 1998 ) = \u2212 5 . 32 , p < 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 24 . Finally , the Montessori - schooled children had a signi \ufb01 cantly lower Q ( M = 0 . 582 , SD = 0 . 03 ) than the traditional - schooled children ( M = 0 . 589 , SD = 0 . 02 ) , t ( 1998 ) = \u2212 7 . 07 , p < 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 32 . Thus , compared to the traditional group , the semantic network of the Montessori group was more interconnected ( higher CC ) , with shorter paths between concepts ( lower ASPL ) and fewer subcommunities ( lower Q ) . DISCUSSION Despite the central importance of education for child development , whether educational differences impact how children represent knowledge has remained unknown . The present research provides the \ufb01 rst evidence to indicate that education shapes both the structure of children \u2019 s semantic memory and their ability to think creatively . As a test case , we focused on children experiencing a common child - centered - constructivist education ( i . e . , Montessori ) versus traditional education . While both can be of high quality , their approach to concepts learning differ in many aspects . We found that compared to children experiencing a traditional education , children experiencing Montessori education showed a more \u201c \ufb02 exible \u201d semantic network structure , characterized by higher connectivity and shorter paths between concepts , as well as lower modularity \u2014 a network structure that is conducive to connecting remotely - associated concepts when thinking creatively 8 . Consistent with this view , the Montessori class showed higher scores on tests of both divergent and convergent creative thinking . Critically , the groups were matched on nonverbal intelligence and demographic / socio - economic factors , indicating that differences in semantic network Fig . 1 Semantic Network . 2D Visualization of the semantic networks of the Montessori and traditional groups .

S . Denervaud et al . 3 Published in partnership with The University of Queensland npj Science of Learning ( 2021 ) 35 and creative thinking are speci \ufb01 c to school education and not due to extraneous group differences . The \ufb01 ndings suggest that educational practices have an impact on the structure of semantic memory , with implications for higher cognitive functions such as creativity . The \ufb01 ndings may re \ufb02 ect differences in how knowledge is taught at school . In a more interdisciplinary and active way of learning , concepts may be perceived as more dynamic and connected , offering children a more \ufb02 exible , broader understanding and interpretation of concepts \u2014 beyond what they may learn in a more directed education ( leading to more passive learning ) that focuses on distinct disciplines successively . Differences in knowl - edge representation may also be related to other factors , such as free movement and active learning , found in Montessori educa - tion , or the uninterrupted work ( providing no time limit or stress to embody concepts ) , peer - peer teaching ( rehearsal of concepts , impact on attentional processes ) , and multi - age classes ( higher diversity in language heard ) . Together , each of these educational features may gradually come to shape and / or train the structure of children \u2019 s semantic networks , with continued expansion and integration of networks with learning over time 31 , 32 . Future work is critical to better decipher which factors provide children the opportunity to grow enriched knowledge representation , and why . With respect to creativity , we found that education differences played a signi \ufb01 cant role in affecting children \u2019 s creative thinking . Across both divergent and convergent creativity tests , children from Montessori classes showed higher scores compared to their peers from af \ufb02 uent traditional classes , corroborating previous studies on creativity in Montessori students 11 , 12 . Similar to semantic abilities , speci \ufb01 c teaching practices found in Montessori classes may foster higher creativity skills , such as the error - and - trial approach ( children need to solve problems by and for themselves ) , the peer - peer tutoring in multi - age classes ( higher social diversity , different points of view ) , the multisensory didactic material ( using more than two senses to learn and later create ) , the absence of time pressure ( uninterrupted three working hours ) , and the project - based learning ( self - directed exploration ) . Which of these factors explain higher creative thinking is not yet known . However , we suspect that it may even be the combination of these , and may be even other / unknown factors , that allow children to access and train their creative abilities . Future work is crucially needed in that direction . For now , the semantic network and creativity results are consistent with studies in adults , which have found that high creative ability is characterized by the same \ufb02 exible network structure observed in Montessori students from the current study , i . e . , high connectivity and short paths between concepts , with less modularity of concepts into discrete subcommunities 8 , 33 . This \ufb02 exible network structure is thought to be conducive to creative thinking , allowing concepts to be more ef \ufb01 ciently accessed and \ufb02 exibly combined , compared to a network structure that is more spread out and modular 8 . An important direction for future research will be to directly examine the interactions between education , semantic structure , and creative thinking . Importantly , given the group - based approach to modeling semantic networks , the current study could not link individual network metrics to creativity scores . Future research should conduct longitudinal analyses to examine how semantic network structure relates to the development of creative thinking over time in different educational contexts , and to expand this investigation to other higher - level cognitive abilities ( e . g . , language skills in general ) . Although we could not directly link semantic network metrics with creativity scores , we found that children from Montessori classes , despite an average number of responses similar to their peers from traditional classes ( which all correlated with creativity scores ) , produced more unique verbal \ufb02 uency responses , poten - tially re \ufb02 ecting a greater depth and breadth of semantic knowl - edge ( at least within the animal category ) . While Montessori education is not known for promoting learning about animals more than Swiss traditional classes ( i . e . , speci \ufb01 c material exposed in the environment ) , this \ufb01 nding corroborates previous studies reporting the early acquisition of reading skills in Montessori schoolchildren , and later higher outcomes in language tasks 12 \u2013 14 , 34 . Montessori education offers a language curricula that starts as early as the children gain curiosity for the sounds and letters , around 3 . 5 years of age 9 , 10 . Children in these classrooms are given educational materials to learn real - life concepts by associating names with objects ( e . g . , speci \ufb01 c leaf shape with \u201c obovate \u201d ) . Over time , the children learn to categorize concepts ( e . g . , plant phylogeny ) , while conducting experiments in and out of the classroom ( e . g . , seeding plants , collecting leaves ) . It may be that while children \u2019 s abstraction and semantic memory grow and mature , a form of experience - dependent plasticity comes to deepen their understanding of concepts , dynamically shaping semantic networks as new concepts are learned and connections are made between them . Enriched language curricula \u2014 with self - directed and naturalistic activities that introduce successive levels of concept knowledge \u2014 may help children optimally train and expand the breadth and depth of their semantic knowledge ( perception , conceptualization , generalization ) . The structure of semantic networks may also bene \ufb01 t from the diversity of social interactions found in multi - age classes ( such as Montessori ) , where fostered peer - to - peer teaching may hasten the assimilation of vocabulary 35 . Future research should identify the relative con - tributions of classroom curricula and social factors in in \ufb02 uencing the development of semantic networks and related cognitive abilities , such as creativity . The present study has some caveats . First , our study relies on a cross - sectional design . While these results constitute early evidence that semantic networks are highly permeable to educational experience , longitudinal studies are needed . Second , our study included only one semantic category ( animals ) . However , it would be of interest to study other semantic domains , based on child - centered interests ( i . e . , leisure activities , hobbies ) to explore \u201c out - of - class \u201d knowledge representation , and to assess any transfer effects from academic knowledge representation to self - directed learning of new concepts ( i . e . , do children learn a pattern of semantic organization , or do they learn a model of ideas independently from each other ) . Finally , we cannot infer which features from the Montessori education help children to build a \ufb02 exible and extensive semantic network . Future research could investigate speci \ufb01 c educational features , such as early training in reading , learning concepts from active and naturalistic activities , and peer - to - peer learning . These studies can shed light on how educators can foster \u201c \ufb02 exible \u201d knowledge representation within schools , creating learning environments that promote deep learning , and creativity . METHOD Participants A total of 67 children participated in the current study ( M age = 9 . 31 , SD = 2 . 23 , 47 . 8 % girls ) through the University Hospital of Lausanne research pool as part of a broader research project on education and neurocog - nitive development . Children were compensated with a ~ 30 USD gift voucher for completion of the study . Inclusion criteria were schooling system ( participants had to be enrolled in Montessori or in traditional classes from the early years on , in the case of the youngest children , or for at least 3 years ) , age ( 5 \u2013 14 years of age ) ; exclusion criteria were parental report of learning disabilities or sensory impairment . To account for variability in our measures due to nonverbal intelligence , or socioeconomic background , we controlled for between - group homogeneity in nonverbal intelligence ( black and white short version of the Progressive Matrices 36 ) and family socioeconomic status ( both parents \u2019 education levels ( score from 1 to 5 ) and current job ( score from 1 to 4 ) ; scores were summed and averaged between both parents ( max 9 ) , with higher scores denoting higher SES ) . S . Denervaud et al . 4 npj Science of Learning ( 2021 ) 35 Published in partnership with The University of Queensland A chi - square test of goodness - of - \ufb01 t was performed to determine whether the gender ratios were equal between the Montessori and traditional group of children . In addition , we conducted t tests ( independent or Welch \u2019 s , according to the preliminary data check with Q \u2013 Q plots and Levene \u2019 s test ) with a 95 % con \ufb01 dence interval ( CI ) for the mean difference to test for signi \ufb01 cant differences between the groups on demographic variables and nonverbal intelligence . MATERIALS Verbal \ufb02 uency Children completed verbal \ufb02 uency task . Category verbal \ufb02 uency tasks have been widely used to ef \ufb01 ciently assess semantic network organization 37 . Consistent with traditional task adminis - tration 38 , each child had 60 s to name as many animals as he / she could . Based on previous work in children , we targeted the animal category 39 . Children spoke their responses out loud , which were recorded ( and later transcribed ) by an experimenter . For each child , \ufb02 uency data was preprocessed using the SemNA pipeline in R 37 . Repetitions or variation on roots were converged and non - category members were excluded from the \ufb01 nal analysis . Number of responses per participant were summed ( total number of responses ) . An independent t test was used to determine whether both groups differ on average number of responses and number of unique responses , permitting a test of whether education affects the types of words that children retrieve when searching semantic memory . Creativity assessment To assess creative thinking , children completed divergent and convergent creativity tasks from the Evaluation of Potential Creativity 40 . Divergent thinking re \ufb02 ects the ability to think of ideas that differ from one another ; convergent thinking re \ufb02 ects the ability to think of a single creative solution . Performance on such creative thinking tasks has been shown to predict both academic 41 and creative 42 achievement . In the divergent thinking task , the child was asked to draw as many different drawings as possible from one imposed abstract form ( i . e . , incomplete shape ) , within 10 min . The \ufb01 nal score was the sum of all valid drawings . In the convergent thinking task , the child had to select three different abstract forms out of eight to create an original drawing that combined them , within 15 min . Three blind judges scored the drawings for originality following the EPoC scoring manual ( inter - rater agreement ; Krippen - dorff \u2019 s alpha = 0 . 905 ) . Independent t tests were computed on each creativity score ( divergent and convergent ) to test for between - group differences . Pearson \u2019 s correlations were computed between each creativity score and the verbal \ufb02 uency metrics to test whether creative thinking relates to the quantity and quality of words retrieved from semantic memory . Network analysis The semantic verbal \ufb02 uency data of both groups were analyzed using a semantic network approach 43 , 44 . In this approach , each node represents a category exemplar ( e . g . , frog ) and edges represent associations between two exemplars . These associations are the tendency of the sample to generate exemplar b ( e . g . , toad ) when they have also generated exemplar a ( e . g . , frog ) . All network analyses were conducted in R using a publicly - available pipeline to analyze semantic \ufb02 uency data as networks 37 , with the following steps : Semantic network estimation . The processed data were trans - ferred into a binary response matrix , where columns represent the unique exemplars given by the sample and rows represent participants ; the response matrix is \ufb01 lled out by 1 ( if an exemplar was generated by that participant ) and 0 ( if that exemplar was not generated ) . To control for confounding factors ( such as different nodes or edges in both groups ) , as in previous studies 25 , 43 , the binary response matrices only include responses that are given by at least two participants in each group . Then , to avoid the two groups including a different number of nodes , which may bias comparison of network parameters , responses in the binary matrices were equated , so that the networks of both groups in each sample are compared using the same nodes 37 . Next , we computed a word association matrix for each group using the cosine similarity . The cosine similarity is commonly used in related to Pearson \u2019 s correlation , which can be considered as the cosine between two normalized vectors . With the cosine similarity measure , all values are positive ranging from 0 ( two responses do not co - occur ) to 1 ( two responses always co - occur ) . For both groups , each element in the word association matrix , A ij , represents the cosine similarity or the co - occurrence between response i and j . Finally , using these word association matrices , we applied the triangulated maximally \ufb01 ltered graph TMFG 37 ; to minimize noise and potential spurious associations . The TMFG method \ufb01 lters the word association matrices to capture only the most relevant information ( i . e . , removal of spurious associations and retaining the largest associations ) within the original network . This approach retains the same number of edges between groups ( i . e . , 3 n \u2013 6 , where n equals the number of responses ) , which avoids the confound of difference network structures being due to a different number of edges 43 . This resulted in a 68 nodes network with 198 edges for both groups . Semantic network analyses . The SemNA pipeline in R 37 was used to compute the CC , ASPL , and Q measures for both groups . Clustering Coef \ufb01 cient ( CC ) refers to the extent that neighbors of a node will themselves be neighbors ( i . e . , a neighbor is a node i that is connected through an edge to node j ) . Higher clustering coef \ufb01 cient indicates a more interconnected semantic network 24 . Average Shortest Path Length ( ASPL ) refers to the average shortest number of steps ( i . e . , edges ) needed to traverse between any pair of nodes ; the higher the ASPL , the more spread out a network is . Previous research has shown that the ASPL in semantic networks corresponds to participants \u2019 judgments as to whether two concepts are related to each other 24 . Modularity ( Q ) estimates how a network breaks apart ( or partitions ) into smaller sub - networks or communities 24 . Q measures the extent to which the network has dense connections between nodes within a community and sparse ( or few ) connections between nodes in different communities . Thus , the higher Q , the more the network breaks apart to subcommunities . Such subcommunities can be thought of as subcategories in a semantic network ( e . g . , farm animals in the \u201c animals \u201d category ) . Previous research has shown that modularity in semantic networks is inversely related to a network \u2019 s \ufb02 exibility 8 . Statistical analysis . We applied two complementary approaches for comparing the networks : comparisons against random net - works and bootstrap network comparisons . Our \ufb01 rst approach , comparisons against random networks , is used to determine whether the network measures ( ASPL , CC , and Q ) observed in the groups \u2019 networks are different from what would be expected from a random network with the same number of nodes and edges 45 . This approach iteratively simulates Erd\u00f6s \u2013 R\u00e9nyi random networks ( e . g . , 1000 networks ) with the same number of nodes and edges with a \ufb01 xed edge probability 46 . For each simulated random network , network measures ( i . e . , CC , ASPL , and Q ) are computed , resulting in a sampling distribution of these measures for the random network . The empirical group network measures are then compared against the respective distributions of the random network measures . The Erd\u00f6s \u2013 R\u00e9nyi random network model does not make any assumptions regarding the structure of the network , S . Denervaud et al . 5 Published in partnership with The University of Queensland npj Science of Learning ( 2021 ) 35 which makes it a useful null model to test against 46 . That is , it tests whether the network structure for a speci \ufb01 c network measure could be generated from a random network model . Second , for each dataset , we used a bootstrapping approach to simulate and compare semantic networks of the two groups 25 , 43 . We applied the case - wise bootstrap method , which resamples from the original sample with replacement . Each bootstrap sample has as many participants as the original sample but with some participants being included more than once and others not being included at all . Networks are estimated on each bootstrap sample following the network construction approach described above . Network measures are then computed for these networks . This process repeated iteratively for 1000 times . Similar to the comparisons against random networks , these bootstrapped networks form a sampling distribution of the network measures for both groups , but solely based on the empirical data . Independent - group t tests are then applied to statistically examine the difference between the distribution of the three network measures ( CC , ASPL , and Q ) across both groups . Cohen \u2019 s d effect sizes are reported following 47 : small = 0 . 20 , moderate = 0 . 50 , and large = 0 . 80 . Procedure This study was approved by the ethical committee of the CER - Vaud ( Switzerland ) . Written informed consent to take part in the study was obtained from parents and oral consent from children , who acknowledged that they were free to withdraw at any time without penalty . Group variables ( e . g . , SES ) were collected through online questionnaires completed at home after the experiment . Verbal \ufb02 uency and creativity data were collected by the experimenter in school , in a dedicated room , with the child seated at a table next to the experimenter . Each child was randomly assigned to complete one of the two tasks \ufb01 rst .

Introduction Originally , Schumpeter coined the term of \u2018recombination\u2019 as the creation process that leads to new combinations and , in turn , to creative destructions in the economy ( Schumpeter , 1939 ) . Until now , the dominant view on recombination has considered recombination as the creation of new linkages between unlinked ( technological ) components or creating new linkages between already linked components ( i . e . linking them in new ways ) , aimed at a speci\ufb01c application ( Hargadon and Sutton , 1997 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . In line with evolutionary theorizing , this process has been also referred to as \u2018adaptation\u2019 , formed by technologi - cal search activities that are progressively adapted and improved through a selection environment made up , among others , of user needs . However , in Schumpeter\u2019s view , the application of a given set of ( technological ) components in a new domain of use can also be considered as a new combination that quali\ufb01es as an innovation ( Schumpeter , 1939 ) . Whereas the dominant focus in the literature has mainly been on the launch of new products through adapta - tions to existing products or the application of new methods of production , much less emphasis has been placed on Schumpeter\u2019s \u2217 Corresponding author .

This phenomenon of the emergence of a new domain of use and market for an existing technology refers to the idea of exapta - tion . Recently , the concept of exaptation has made its appearance in innovation studies ( Andriani and Cattani , 2016 ; Andriani and Cohen , 2013 ; Andriani and Carignani , 2014 ; Cattani , 2005 , 2006 ; Dew et al . , 2004 ; Furnari , 2011 ; Lane et al . , 2007 ; Felin et al . , 2014 , 2016 ) . Gould and Vrba ( 1982 : 6 ) originally introduced the con - cept of exaptation in evolutionary biology to contrast it with that of adaptation and refer to \u2018biological characters evolved for other usages ( or for no function at all ) and later \u201ccoopted\u201d for their current role\u2019 . In innovation studies , an exaptation refers to a technology that is \ufb01t for its current function thanks to technological features that were selected for old functions \u2013 or that had none at all \u2013 and were later \u2018co - opted\u2019 for their current function . Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the printing press , for example , was based on technological com - ponents of the wine press co - opted for the new function of printing ( Johnson , 2010 ) . Innovation through exaptation forms a pervasive phenomenon in many industries and the examples abound . For instance , the birth of the entire modern pharmaceutical and chemical industries was triggered by multiple exaptations of coal tar . Another exam - ple is the microwave oven , which resulted from the discovery of a new function of the radar magnetron . Or the tractor engine , a http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . respol . 2016 . 04 . 003 0048 - 7333 / \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved . 1420 M . Mastrogiorgio , V .

Andriani and Carignani , 2014 ) . Despite its importance as a key mechanism underlying the emergence of new technologies and the \u2018genesis of new markets\u2019 ( Dew et al . , 2004 : 70 ) , the literature on exaptation is still limited in size and it has focused on the theoretical aspects , or it has been conducted though case studies and simulations . The few empirical studies have mainly focused on the organization - level conditions of exaptation ( see Ref . Cattani , 2005 ) . As noticed by Stuart Kauffman , \u2018one of the most striking facts about current eco - nomic theory\u2019 is the lack of an account of the persistent explosion of technologies , goods , and markets into their \u2018adjacent possible\u2019 through exaptation events ( Kauffmann , 2000 : 212 ) . Whereas these events imply the\u00b4\u0131functional shift\u2019 of technological features that was not \u2018anticipated\u2019 ex ante , the literature offers a limited understand - ing of this alternative mechanism of innovation that , therefore , has been often attributed to \u2018serendipitous\u2019 processes that imply high levels of randomness . In this paper , we analyze the likelihood of functional shift events and its determinants . Hence we attribute this alternative mechanism of innovation to processes that have an underlying structure and can be , therefore , possibly controlled by managers and policymakers . In order to address this , this paper digs deeper into exapta - tion by adopting a micro approach and by focusing on invention and inventor - level conditions rather than organization - level con - ditions . This focus on invention and inventor - level conditions is consistent with a recent call for research on exaptation : Cattani argued that inventors play a \u2018key role in facilitating the diffusion and recombination of skills and knowledge accumulated in other - wise distinct technological domains [ and ] future research should explore this issue more deeply\u2019 ( Cattani , 2005 : 577 ) . Our focus on invention - level conditions is also consistent with a very recent contribution by Andriani and Carignani ( 2014 ) who analyzed the relationship between technological modularity \u2013 an invention - level condition \u2013 and exaptation , and argued that modularity plays a positive role for exaptation . However , their contribution is mostly theoretical and no empirical test exists on the impact of these con - ditions on exaptation . Our paper is a \ufb01rst attempt in that direction . Based on the empirics of Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) , we explore those conditions that foster \u2018exaptive innovations\u2019 ( rather than \u2018adaptive innovations\u2019 ) and in this way offer a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of new innovations . To accomplish this aim , we will examine : ( 1 ) invention - level conditions related to the underlying technology , and in particular technological complexity , ( 2 ) inventor - level conditions formed by inventors\u2019 ability to draw analogies between different technological domains ; ( 3 ) we will also examine institutional conditions formed by patent scope . The comprehensive treatment of these conditions allows us to focus both on the invention and the agents acting on the invention , and to avoid focusing solely on one while reducing the other to a secondary role ( Lane et al . , 2007 ) . In this way , our study contributes by developing and in - depth understanding of the extent to which innovation through exaptation follows systemat - ically from these conditions . In order to test our hypotheses , we analyse a large sample of patents obtained from the U . S . Patent and Trademark Of\ufb01ce ( USPTO ) and the National Bureau of Eco - nomic Research ( NBER ) databases . As our objective is to examine the conditions of exaptation at the invention and inventor level , we assume that a generic invention is identi\ufb01ed by a patent and introduce a novel measure of exaptation . The measure relies on using cross - class forward citation patterns in order to capture two central aspects of exaptation : ( 1 ) a functional shift aspect and ( 2 ) a non - anticipation aspect that arises when the emergence of a new functionality has not been originally envisioned . The paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 we formulate testable hypotheses , in Section 3 we describe the data and the empirical setting , and in Section 4 we present the results . Section 5 presents our discussion and conclusions , and also formulates a number of important implications for managers and policy makers with an interest and ambition in stimulating innovation through exaptation . 2 . Theory 2 . 1 . Innovation and the economy : a missing link As argued by Beinhocker ( 2007 ) , the modern global economy is characterized by a multitude of technologies and goods , as demon - strated by the fact that there may be more or less 10 billion distinct goods for sale in a city such as New York City . As noted by Koppl et al . ( 2014 ) , the importance of the phenomenon has justi\ufb01ed the introduction of a name for it \u2013 \u2018cambio - diversity\u2019 \u2013 which is the analogous of bio - diversity and refers to the diversity and vari - ety of exchanged technologies and goods . The importance of the phenomenon lies in the fact that a positive relationship has been observed between the diversity of goods and technologies and eco - nomic growth ( Hidalgo et al . , 2007 ) . 1 Some scholars have recently disentangled the relationship and analyzed how the key driver of diversity \u2013 new combinations \u2013 positively affects economic growth ( Weitzman , 1998 ) . Where do new combinations \u2013 and , as a conse - quence , diversity \u2013 come from ? As recently argued by Felin et al . ( 2014 : 7 ) , \u2018radical and emergent heterogeneity in nature is not explainable by appealing to the mechanisms of [ adaptive ] selec - tion alone\u2019 but also to exaptation . In a similar way , it has been recently noted that new combinations are enabled by exaptation and not only adaptive . This points to the far - reaching economic implications of exaptation , which have been recently emphasized and discussed by Felin et al . ( 2016 ) . Despite this emphasis , an analysis of the micro - determinants of exaptation and of how exaptation enables new combinations is still missing . As a consequence , this alternative mechanism of innovation has been often linked to under - explained serendipi - tous processes , rather than to a set of systematic conditions that affect the likelihood of exaptation . We do not attribute to man - agers the power to \u2018predict\u2019 the occurrence of \u2018speci\ufb01c\u2019 exaptation events because , as recently argued by Kauffman ( 2008 : 171 ) , \u2018there appears to be no \u201cmechanical effective procedure\u201d [ . . . ] to \ufb01nd novel uses of existing goods [ . . . ] \u2019 . However , \u2018it may still be possible to extract statistical organizational laws ( p . 171 ) \u2019 . 2 2 . 2 . Exaptation Example : the Radar Magnetron . Andriani and Carignani ( 2014 ) provide several examples of exaptation . An example of the breakthrough - generating nature of exaptation is the invention of the microwave oven , which resulted from the sudden discovery of a new function of a component of the radar called \u2018magnetron\u2019 . The discovery happened serendipitously when Mr . Spencer \u2013 an engi - neer working for a U . S military contractor \u2013 discovered that the magnetron was responsible for the melting of a candy bar in his pocket . Now the magnetron is a key component of the microwave . Despite the pervasiveness of similar examples in several indus - tries , the research on exaptation is still limited in size . Research has been mainly conducted through case studies ( Cattani , 2006 ; Furnari 2011 ) , computer simulations ( Lane et al . , 2007 ) , or it has focused on theoretical aspects ( Andriani and Carignani , 2014 ; Dew 1 These studies fall under the \ufb01eld of \u2018complexity economics\u2019 ( Beinhocker , 2007 ) . 2 Although managers cannot \u2018predict\u2019 the phenomenon , they can \u2018control\u2019 it . See Ref . Wiltbank et al . ( 2006 ) for a distinction between prediction and control in exap - tive settings . M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 1421 et al . , 2004 ; Felin et al . , 2016 ) . Few empirical studies have been conducted and they have mainly focused on the organization - level conditions for exaptation . For instance , Cattani ( 2005 ) has analyzed the role played by \ufb01rm\u2019s \u2018pre - adapted capabilities\u2014that is those capabilities accumulated in the past that turned out to be useful for co - opting an existing technology for a new function . In particular , he has analyzed how the accumulation of capabilities in the pro - duction of glass allowed big glass manufacturers ( such as Corning ) to co - opt glass \ufb01bers for long - distance communication and thus enter the \ufb01ber optics industry . He found that both the stock of pre - adapted capabilities and the extent to which \ufb01rms build on them increase \ufb01rms\u2019 technological performance . In this paper , we dig deeper into exaptation and examine those micro aspects and invention and inventor - level conditions that fos - ter the exaptation of technologies such as the radar magnetron . In particular , we examine the following conditions : 1 ) Technological complexity , which is the necessary condition that makes exaptation \u2018possible\u2019 . Technological complexity is de\ufb01ned in terms of the level of interdependence among the physi - cal components of a technology ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ; Kauffmann , 1993 ; Ulrich , 1995 ) . 3 We focus on technological complexity because , as pointed out by Dew et al . ( 2004 ) , exap - tation follows from the possibility to decompose a technology into its components and therefore directly depends on a not - excessive level of interdependence among them . A similar point has been recently raised by Andriani and Carignani ( 2014 : 1609 ) who note that the possibility to decompose a technology mul - tiplies the exaptive design options of the technology and \u2018the overall effect is a combinatorial explosion of innovative pos - sibilities\u2019 . The relationship between decomposition and design options is a major contribution of Baldwin and Clark ( 2000 ) . 2 ) Inventors \u2019 analogical ability , which is the \u2018ability to realize\u2019 the possibility opened up by technological complexity . New cre - ative syntheses often result from linking different knowledge domains . This is the ability of inventors to draw inventive analo - gies between different technological domains . 3 ) Patent scope , which is the \u2018institutional room\u2019 for inventors to realize the possibility for exaptation offered by technological complexity . Patent scope is the set of hypothetical developments of the technology that , together with the main con\ufb01guration , are also subject to patent protection . We focus on patent scope because , as recently emphasized by Andriani and Carignani ( 2014 : 1616 ) , \u2018exaptation - based processes face multiple obsta - cles that are rooted in the way innovation is conceptualised [ . . . ] and property rights are regulated\u2019 . Similarly , Merges and Nelson ( 1990 ) have argued that the possibility to explore novel techno - logical con\ufb01gurations can be seriously limited by the extension of patent scope . 2 . 3 . Technological complexity We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne a technology as a system composed of a hierar - chy of subparts ( Vincenti , 1994 ; Whitney , 2005 ) . We then de\ufb01ne technological complexity in terms of the level of interdependence between the subparts ( or \u2018coupling\u2019 , as in Ref . Ulrich , 1995 ) . In previous related work , technological complexity has been de\ufb01ned as the interaction of the number of subparts ( N ) and their inter - dependence ( K ) ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . This work builds on one of Kauffman\u2019s earliest contributions such as the NK model ( Kauffmann , 1993 ) , a simulation framework of biological adap - 3 The de\ufb01nition of modularity is similar , although the literature has provided sev - eral de\ufb01nitions . Modularity refers to the degree to which a technology is composed of modules that are weakly connected to each other ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) . tation that has found several applications in the innovation and management literature . Given that the main assumption of the NK model is the existence of one \ufb01tness function to be optimized while exaptation implies a different framework with multiple \ufb01tness func - tions , and that Kauffman\u2019s work mainly focuses on the impact of interdependence , we de\ufb01ne complexity in terms of interdepen - dence and introduce the number of subparts as a separate control ( see Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) . 4 , 5 When technological complexity is high , the inventive process of \u2018decomposition and modi\ufb01cation\u2019 is constrained by complex interdependencies between the subparts . The idea that such con - straints matter for invention is well established in engineering studies . According to Phillips ( 2007 : 4 ) , \u2018there is a struggle between the creative ideas of machine designers and their recalcitrant , real machinery\u2019\u2014that is between the ideas of inventors and the physi - cal constraints imposed by technologies . Vincenti ( 1991 ) has also noted that inventors can have more degrees of freedom \u2013 and arrive more easily at novel solutions \u2013 when these constraints are low . The importance of constraints is also evidenced by the current use of scienti\ufb01c and visual approaches for their representation , such as \u2018kinematic\u2019 principles and the use of \u2018design structure matri - ces\u2019 in current engineering practice ( Casals et al . , 2012 ; Eckhardt 1998 ; Phillips , 2007 ) . The different ways to decompose and mod - ify a technology have been classi\ufb01ed by the modularity literature , which has de\ufb01ned a set of modular \u2018operators\u2019 such that any major technological decomposition and modi\ufb01cation can be represented by a combination of them ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) . 6 \u2018Substituting\u2019 and \u2018augmenting\u2019 operators are of pivotal importance , as they are at the basis of technological modi\ufb01cations that improve the func - tioning of a technology or expand its sets of possible functionalities . \u2018Substituting operators\u2019 ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) \u2013 substituting a technological subpart for a better one after the technology has been decomposed \u2013 have been studied in the innovation literature that has focused on the processes of technological \u2018adaptation\u2019 . In partic - ular , technological improvements or adaptations\u2014realised through substituting operators , are usually enhanced by intermediate levels of technological complexity . \u2018Augmenting operators\u2019 \u2013 which con - sist in adding a new technological subpart that gives the technology a new functionality and are the implicit focus of our paper ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) \u2013 give rise to novel functionalities or exaptations but they have received much less attention in the literature despite their breakthrough - generating nature . 7 As noted by Dew et al . ( 2004 ) , exaptation follows from the \u2018pos - sibility\u2019 of decomposing a technology into its subparts . In fact , as argued by Kauffmann ( 2000 ) , \u2018a system in which combination is easy to happen will rapidly explore the adjacent possible\u2019 . 8 We will 4 As noted by Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 : 1025 ) , \u2018Kauffmann\u2019s ( 1993 ) work focuses on the impact of interdependence on the search process . Indeed the NK model simulation results show little effect of N on the mean \ufb01tness of local optima\u2019 . 5 A generalized NK model with multiple \ufb01tness functions has been proposed by Altenberg . However , the model somehow assumes that functions are speci\ufb01ed ex - ante ( see Ref . Bonaccorsi , 2011 for a review and discussion ) , while the main idea of exaptation is that functions are un - prespeci\ufb01able as evolution is un - prestateable ( Felin et al . , 2014 ) . 6 The modularity literature has de\ufb01ned the following operators : substituting , augmenting , splitting , inverting , porting , and excluding . 7 As suggested by one of the reviewers , \u2018augmenting\u2019 operators do not necessarily translate into exaptations . Moreover , \u2018substituting\u2019 operators may eventually trans - late into exaptations as the example of the CD - rom illustrates ( see Ref . Dew et al . , 2004 ) . The relationship between augmenting / substituting operators and exaptation somehow re\ufb02ects the distinction between \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018internal\u2019 types of exaptation , which has been recently addressed by the literature ( see next footnote ) . 8 Andriani and Carignani ( 2014 ) have started to develop a framework for exapta - tion and modularity , taking into account the level at which exaptation takes place within a modular architecture . They distinguish between \u2018radical\u2019 , \u2018internal\u2019 , and \u2018external\u2019 exaptation . The most interesting case is when an exaptation is radical , and this happens when a module is exapted and an entirely new technological archi - 1422 M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 argue that intermediate levels of complexity positively increase the degrees of freedom to add new subparts to a technology and the likelihood of realising con\ufb01gurations with novel functional - ities , and therefore of exaptation . The fact that the likelihood of exaptation increases for intermediate levels of technological com - plexity suggests the existence of an inverted U - shaped relationship between exaptation and technological complexity : exaptation is more likely for intermediate levels of technological complexity and is less likely for both very high and very low levels of technological complexity . High levels of technological complexity expose inven - tors and designers to a \u2018complexity catastrophe\u2019 ( Kauffmann , 1993 ) : they will have to devote their efforts to the processing of com - plex interdependencies and interactions among subparts ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . This will reduce their ability to explore \u2018aug - menting con\ufb01gurations\u2019 , and therefore exaptation . In other words , high levels of technological complexity will limit the possibility of decomposing and modifying a technology through the addi - tion of a new subpart that gives the technology \u2018some new type of functionality\u2019 ( Baldwin and Clark 2000 : 136 ) . Lower levels of tech - nological complexity , on the other hand , will allow inventors and designers to eliminate cycling traps and loops in the design process and to explore augmenting con\ufb01gurations more easily ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ; Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . However , exces - sively low levels of technological complexity come with a cost , since they are achieved through the imposition of \u2018design rules\u2019 that remove certain variables from the set of choices , and this reduces the ability of inventors and designers to explore other areas of the \u2018space\u2019 of possible designs ( Baldwin and Clark 2000 ; Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . This means that both very high and very low levels of technological complexity reduce the ability of inventors to explore augmenting con\ufb01gurations , and therefore exaptation . Although very low levels of complexity achieved through very high modularization reduce exaptation \u2014 as high modularization hides many parts of the architecture , it is also true that high modu - larization continues to release some modules to the world and make them available for re - use . 9 However , it reveals less com - pared to a situation of lower modularization ( higher complexity ) . This implies lower exaptation and , in turn , explains the left - side of the inverted U - shaped relationship . 10 Our argument is gener - ally consistent with what argued by as Baldwin and Clark . They have emphasized the positive aspects of modularity , but they have also explicitly argued that excessive complexity - reducing modu - larization through design rules implies signi\ufb01cant costs : \u2018 Converting an ordinary design parameter into a design rule entails both ben - e\ufb01ts and costs . [ . . . ] Designers will lose the ability to explore some parts of the space of designs\u2014in effect , the architects will restrict the search , declaring some parts of the design space to be out of bounds \u2019 ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 : 69 ) . This is consistent with the above - tecture , with a new function , arises around the exapted module ( usually through augmentation ) . An exaptation is internal when a module is exapted inside an exist - ing technological architecture , whose function does not change . An exaptation is external when the entire architecture is exapted for a new function . In a way , our paper tests empirically the relationship between technological complexity and radical exaptation . 9 We thank one of the reviewers for this suggestion . 10 The underlying assumption is that , given a \ufb01xed number of components and design variables , modularization consists in an increase in the size of modules that progressively hides parts of the architecture . However , modularization can also con - sist in an increase in the number of modules ( Frenken and Menderitzki , 2012 ; Ethiraj and Levinthal , 2004 ) \u2013 rather than in their size \u2013 and , therefore , does not necessarily hide parts of the architecture ( leaving them available for exaptation ) . This makes possible to observe a negative ( positive ) monotonic relationship between complex - ity ( modularity ) and exaptation rather than an inverted U - shaped . Therefore , the nature of the relationship may depend on the type of modularization . We leave this to future research although , due to the \ufb01ne grained level of analysis , we are not sure about how patent data could be used to distinguish between the two mechanisms . Simulation approaches could eventually complement patent studies . mentioned inverted U - shaped relationship tested empirically by Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) in a similar research setting . Further - more , this is also consistent with an NK simulation of Ethiraj and Levinthal ( 2004 ) , who analyzed the trade - offs between the poor recombinant performance that results from excessively high or low levels of interdependence . These trade - offs have been further analyzed in the recent literature on the values and costs of mod - ularity and on optimal levels of modularity for technologies with multiple functions ( Brusoni et al . , 2007 ; Frenken and Menderitzki , 2012 ) . This literature has produced several models which some - times exhibit \u2018con\ufb02icting results\u2019 on these trade - offs ( Frenken and Menderitzki , 2012 : 948 ) : for more clarity , we refer the technically - oriented reader to the above - mentioned papers . 11 Overall , we expect exaptation to be highest for intermediate levels of tech - nological complexity . In other words , we expect to observe that intermediate levels of complexity maximize the \u2018design options\u2019 of a technology ( Baldwin and Clark , 2000 ) and expand the set of novel functionalities . This leads to our \ufb01rst hypothesis : H1 . Technological complexity exhibits an inverted U - shaped rela - tionship with exaptation . 2 . 4 . Analogy making Exaptation also follows from the \u2018ability\u2019 of inventors to draw new creative syntheses that often result from linking different knowledge domains . This is the ability of inventors to draw inventive analogies between different technological domains . Anal - ogy making plays a central role during the process of invention ( Hargadon and Sutton , 1997 ) . In a more fundamental way , it \u2018stands at the very basis of thought and makes human reasoning possible\u2019 ( see Ref . Chalmers et al . , 1992 ) . Indeed analogy making is gain - ing ground in management and innovation studies ( Gavetti et al . , 2005 ) as well as in the exaptation literature ( Furnari , 2011 ) . Anal - ogy making is the transfer of a solution from a known \ufb01eld to a new one ( Gentner , 1983 ; Gick and Holyoak , 1980 ) : ( 1 ) inventors identify a synthetic representation of the \u2018target domain\u2019 that contains the problem to be solved ( e . g . the printing press ) ; ( 2 ) they then recall a synthetic representation from a \u2018base domain\u2019 they had previous experience with and whose problems displayed a similar struc - ture to that of the target problem ( e . g . the wine press ) ; ( 3 ) this base domain provides solutions to the target problem ; and ( 4 ) one of the solutions may eventually be applied . Therefore , successful analogy making depends on the inventors\u2019 ability to create a map between a base domain and the target problem ( Gentner , 1983 ) . This ability , in turn , is a function of the inventors\u2019 prior knowledge stock in these domains . As argued by Salomon ( 1994 : 372 ) , \u2018knowl - edge acquired prior to the analogy task may also affect positive analogical transfer\u2019 ( see also Refs . Gentner and Landers , 1985 ; Gick and Holyoak , 1980 ) . This knowledge can be more or less domain speci\ufb01c or generic ( Gavetti et al . , 2005 ; Rumelhart , 1980 ) . We \ufb01rst hypothesize that analogical ability allows inventors to envision a novel function for an existing technology ( e . g . for a wine press ) . We then hypothesize that analogical ability allows inven - tors to generate a richer representation of the \u2018architecture\u2019 of the inventive problem ( e . g . how to exapt the wine press into a printing press ) and to process interdependencies during the inventive pro - cess more effectively : this is in part consistent with some recent \ufb01ndings that analogy making is powerful and especially in high - complexity settings ( see Ref . Gavetti et al . , 2005 ) . This has two main implications . First , inventors\u2019 analogical ability has a direct , 11 As argued by Brusoni et al . ( 2007 ) , modularization implies fast searches within a prede\ufb01ned search space . However , these gains may disappear in the long run if compared to less modular search strategies that allow to explore larger search spaces . M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 1423 positive effect on exaptation . Second , it positively moderates the inverted U - shaped relationship between technological complex - ity and exaptation . The existence of a moderation effect somehow builds on the underlying assumption that analogical ability impacts differentially \u2013 across inventors \u2013 on the relationship between com - plexity and exaptation . Therefore , such differential impact should not hold in case analogical ability is normally distributed across the inventors of a target population . However , it is usual for inventor - level abilities to have a skewed - distribution ( see Ref . Singh and Fleming , 2010 ) and the same is true for general human abilities such creativity ( Sternberg and Grigorenko , 2003 ) . 12 , 13 Generally speaking , inventors with higher analogical ability will be able to exploit opportunities for exaptation sooner than inventors lack - ing this ability , already at low levels of technological complexity , whereas at high levels they will generally be better able to link a complex technology to new domains of use despite its complex - ity . In this way , inventors\u2019 analogical ability will also strengthen , apart from an independent effect , the positive relationship between technological complexity and exaptation . Overall , a positive mod - eration effect means that for an inventor with greater analogical ability there is a sharper advantage ( more exaptive innovations ) in moving from low to medium levels of technological complexity : the left - side of the curvilinear relationship will increase more rapidly . Similarly , for an inventor with greater analogical ability there is a sharper advantage in moving from medium to high levels of tech - nological complexity : the right - side of the curvilinear relationship will decrease more slowly . H2 . Inventors\u2019 analogical ability positively affects exaptation . H3 . Inventors\u2019 analogical ability positively moderates the inverted U - shaped relationship between technological complexity and exaptation . 2 . 5 . Patent scope Exaptation also follows from the possibility to build on a tech - nology whose successive developments are not protected by patent scope . We de\ufb01ne patent scope as the size of the set of hypotheti - cal developments of the technology that , together with the main con\ufb01guration , are also subject to patent protection . Patent scope is the set of hypothetical \u2018embodiments\u2019 of the technology that were originally envisioned by the inventors , and can be likened to the fence around a real property : it distinguishes inventors\u2019 intellectual property from the surrounding \u2018terrain\u2019 of technological possibili - ties ( Merges and Nelson , 1990 ) . Patent scope acts as an important institutional condition that shapes successive technological devel - opments ( Kitch , 1977 ; Merges and Nelson , 1990 ) . In particular , it plays an important role for those technologies whose develop - ments can proceed on alternative trajectories ( Merges and Nelson , 1990 ) . As argued by Bonaccorsi ( 2011 ) , the greater the patent scope , the stronger the monopoly power granted to the technology owner and the fewer the incentives for other \ufb01rms to develop a new tech - nology that may infringe on the old one . Indeed Klemperer ( 1990 ) and Gilbert and Shapiro ( 1990 ) have argued that patent scope is a positive input of an innovator\u2019s pro\ufb01t function . Reitzig ( 2003 ) has argued that patent scope is a \u2018value driver\u2019 , and Lerner ( 1994 ) has found that patent scope increases the value of biotech \ufb01rms . Other economists , on the other hand , have stressed the negative aspects 12 The idea that human abilities are normally distributed can be reconducted to Galton : after Galton\u2019s contribution , the normal distribution had become a dogma in many statistical frameworks adopted by psychologists . However , more recent contributions have discovered the skewed - distributed nature of human abilities ( see Ref . Sternberg and Grigorenko , 2003 ) . 13 See Section 4 , descriptive statistics . of patent scope , such as social losses from monopoly and from the power to block future technological developments ( Gallini , 1992 ; Machlup , 1958 ; Scherer , 1980 ; Turner , 1969 ) . We hypothesize that the extension of patent scope limits the incentive of inventors to modify a decomposable technology and explore new exaptive options . This is consistent with the idea that patent scope blocks successive technological developments ( Kitch , 1977 ; Merges and Nelson , 1990 ) . This has two implications . First , patent scope has a direct negative effect on exaptation . Second , it could negatively moderate the inverted U - shaped relation - ship between technological complexity and exaptation . Generally speaking , at low levels of technological complexity , technologies with higher patent scope will decrease opportunities for exapta - tion by inventors than those technologies with lower patent scope . Whereas , at high levels of technological complexity , technologies with higher patent scope will expose downstream inventors to a larger set of missed opportunities for exaptation than those tech - nologies with low patent scope . Overall , a negative moderation effect means that those technologies with greater patent scope are characterized by a sharper disadvantage ( less exaptive innovations ) moving from low to medium levels of technological complexity : the left - side of the curvilinear relationship will increase more slowly . Similarly , those technologies with greater patent scope are char - acterized by a sharper disadvantage moving from medium to high levels of technological complexity : the right - side of the curvilinear relationship will decrease more rapidly . H4 . Patent scope negatively affects exaptation . H5 . Patent scope negatively moderates the inverted U - shaped relationship between technological complexity and exaptation . 3 . Methods 3 . 1 . Data In order to test our hypotheses , we studied exaptation at the invention level ; we identi\ufb01ed an invention with a patent and considered a cross - section of U . S . patents . Raw patent data were obtained from the USPTO and NBER databases ( Hall et al . , 2001 ) , and the main measures were built after merging these databases to the Patent Network Dataverse ( Lai et al . , 2011 ) . Patent data allowed us to exploit the information contained in forward citations and in the classi\ufb01cation system , which proved particularly useful . Forward citations not only re\ufb02ect the replication around the \u2018prior art\u2019 of an invention , they also re\ufb02ect the extension of the prior art in novel technological domains ( Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . This is demonstrated by the fact that , quite often , forward citations come from different technological classes ( Ghiglino and Kuschy , 2010 ) . We refer to them as \u2018cross - class\u2019 forward citations . Overall , our empirical framework builds on the work of Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) ( see also Refs . : Fleming , 2001 ; Singh and Fleming , 2010 ; Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . That empirical treatment is a \ufb01rst attempt in the innovation literature to deal with issues such as technological complexity . Our empirical framework consisted of the following steps : ( 1 ) we considered a random cross - section of U . S . patents granted between January and June 1991 ( both the January \u2013 June interval and the year 1991 were chosen randomly ) ; ( 2 ) for each patent we used a 1991 \u2013 1999 window of forward citations to calculate exaptation ; ( 3 ) for each patent we then con - sidered a 1975 \u2013 1990 pre - sample window in order to calculate technological complexity , inventor\u2019s analogical ability , and other controls . The estimation sample consists of 19076 patents . 1424 M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 3 . 2 . Measures 3 . 2 . 1 . Exaptation Exaptation always implies two aspects : the \u2018functional shift\u2019 of an existing invention , and a certain degree of \u2018non - anticipation\u2019 , as the functional shift cannot always be envisioned ex - ante . Our novel measure of exaptation tries to capture both aspects . In order to capture the functional shift , we built on the fact that forward citations often come from different technological classes ( Ghiglino and Kuschy , 2010 ) . This means that forward citations often re\ufb02ect the extension of an invention in novel technological domains ( Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . We assumed that cross - class forward cita - tions re\ufb02ect the co - option of an invention for novel functions . We therefore assumed that different technological classes iden - tify different functions , and this is consistent with the classi\ufb01cation system developed by the USPTO . 14 In order to capture non - anticipation , we built on the fact that the USPTO assigns a patent to several classes : an OR class , which is mandatory and re\ufb02ects the most comprehensive claim or main function of the invention , and XR classes , which may re\ufb02ect alterna - tive applications envisioned when the patent was granted ( USPTO , 2012a , b ) . If both the OR and XR classes of the focal patent differed from the OR class of the citing patent ( at the three - digit level ) , we assumed that the functional shift was not originally envisioned when the focal patent was granted . We considered only the OR and not the XR class of the citing patent as we were only interested in the main function of the citing technology , and compared it to the main and other envisioned function of the cited technology . Overall , our measure of exaptation is based on the proportion of cross - class forward citations . In our setting , a forward citation is cross - class if both the OR and XR classes of the focal patent differ from the OR class of the citing patent . Therefore , exaptation for patent i is given by : y i = N (cid:2) j = 1 d j N ( 1 ) where N is the number of forward citations received until the end of 1999 , and d j is a dummy equal to 1 if the both the OR and XR classes of patent i differ from the OR class of the citing patent j ( 0 otherwise ) . Therefore , our measure differs from patent generality indexes ( Trajtenberg et al . , 1997 ) used in a variety of studies in order to identify general - purpose technologies . These indexes , also based on the range of technology \ufb01elds that cite the focal patent , are only based on OR classes . Fig . 1 contains a graphical illustration . According to the fourth and \ufb01fth hypothesis , patent scope blocks technological developments pursued by different \ufb01rms and , there - fore , also plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between technological complexity and exaptation . In order to test this hypothesis , we had to modify our measure of exaptation as follows : y i , ext . = N ext . (cid:2) j = 1 d j N ext . ( 2 ) where N ext . is the number of forward citations received from patents that belong to these different \ufb01rms , and d j is de\ufb01ned as above . In order to identify different \ufb01rms , we used a PDPCO identi - \ufb01er ( see NBER PDP Project User Documentation : Matching Patent Data to Compustat Firms ) . The PDPCO identi\ufb01er is the result of several 14 Indeed the USPTO uses the \u2018fundamental , direct , or necessary function as the principal basis of classi\ufb01cation\u2019 , where the \u2018function\u2019 is the result achieved by \u2018similar processes or structures [ . . . ] by the application of similar natural laws to similar substances\u2019 ( USPTO , 2012b : 3 ) . algorithmic procedures that were designed to match patent data to Compustat Data . Patent ownership may change over time , and therefore dynamic matches are recorded in the PDP database . How - ever , for this study , we considered only the match that corresponds to the \ufb01rst owner . Example : the Radar Magnetron . We now return to our earlier example of the exaptation of the magnetron , which led to the inven - tion of the microwave oven . Mr . Spencer obtained a patent for the \ufb01rst microwave oven in history : U . S . patent No . 2 , 495 , 429 , Method of treating foodstuffs , grant date : Jan . 24 1950 . The magnetron , however , was invented several years before by Mr . Hollmann \u2013 a German electronic specialist \u2013 who obtained a patent for it : U . S . patent No . 2 , 123 , 728 , Magnetron , grant date : July 12 , 1938 . The microwave patent falls in the OR class No . 426 ( Food or edible mate - rial : processes , compositions , and products ) while the magnetron patent falls in the OR class No . 315 ( Electric lamp and discharge devices : systems ) , which differs from the microwave OR class as it clearly refers to an entirely different functional domain . Fig . 2 contains a graphical illustration . The magnetron patent also falls in the XR class No . 313 . This class also differs from the microwave OR class , as it refers to other application domains that did not yet include possible uses of the magnetron for cooking . This is evidenced by the corresponding absence of any reference to cooking uses in the claims of the mag - netron patent . 3 . 2 . 2 . Technological complexity We measured technological complexity as in Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) ( see also Ref . Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . The measure is based on the degree of dif\ufb01culty of recombining \u2013 in a pre - sample window \u2013 the subclasses of which the patent is composed . The underlying assumption is that patent subclasses are proxies of underlying components , which can be physical components or pieces of knowledge only indirectly connected to physical con\ufb01g - urations ( Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . The idea behind the measure is that if the patent is composed of subclasses that , in the past , could not be easily re - combined with many other subclasses , this is an indication of the fact that components are characterized by sensi - tive interdependencies and their actual con\ufb01guration belongs to a small set of possible alternative con\ufb01gurations . This kind of patent receives a high value of technological complexity . Conversely , if the patent is composed of subclasses that , in the past , could be re - combined easily with many other subclasses , this is an indication of the fact that components are not characterized by sensitive inter - dependencies and they can be mixed and matched independently . In other words , their actual con\ufb01guration belongs to a large set of possible alternative con\ufb01gurations . This kind of patent receives a low value of technological complexity . Therefore , we measured the technological complexity of patent i as follows : x i = cs i (cid:3) cs i j = 1 er j ( 3 ) where cs i is the number of subclasses of patent i , and er j is the \u2018ease of recombination score\u2019 of each subclass j . In other words , we mea - sured the technological complexity of patent i as the inverse of the average ease of subclass recombination . The ease of recombination of a generic subclass j is given by : er j = N sc , j N pat , j ( 4 ) where N sc , j is the number of subclasses that appeared with sub - class j in N pat , j previous patents . As mentioned before , Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) de\ufb01ned technological complexity as the interac - tion of interdependence and the number of subparts . That is , they measured complexity as the ratio of x i and the number of patent M . Mastrogiorgio , V .

Illustration of the exaptation measure . subclasses . This is because complexity matters when interdepen - dence among technological components is high relative to their number . Instead of dividing by the number of patent subclasses , we introduced it as a separate control . In another speci\ufb01cation of the model \u2013 not reported and available upon request \u2013 we directly divided by the number of subclasses as in Ref . Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) . As we did not \ufb01nd substantial differences in the results , we kept the number of subclasses as a control . The ease of recombi - nation scores were calculated on a 15 - year pre - sample window of all the patents granted in the period from 1975 to 1990 . The same 15 - year pre - sample window was used in the calculation of other variables beyond complexity , such as analogical ability and other controls . We refer the interested reader to the paper of Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) , which contains more information and an illustration of the complexity measure for a digital technology patent . 3 . 2 . 3 . Inventors\u2019 analogical ability The ability of inventors to draw inventive analogies and exapt existing technologies across different domains is a function of their stock of knowledge spanning these domains . We introduced a novel measure of inventors\u2019 analogical abilities that quanti\ufb01es their multi - domain skills . In order to build the measure , we considered the inventor ( or team ) belonging to the \ufb01rst citing patent . We then extracted , from the Patent Network Dataverse ( Lai et al . , 2011 ) , the inventor\u2019s previous patents that belong to the 1975 \u2013 1990 pre - sample window . We then counted the number of previous patents whose OR class was equal to the OR class of either the focal patent or the citing patent . It could be argued that an inventor has a high value on the count by simply having deep experience in either the OR class of the focal patent or that of the citing patent , rather than having equally - distributed experience in both classes . This type of consideration could make us lean toward a product - based rather than a sum - based measure . A product - based measure would be equal to zero in the case of an inventor having deep experience in one class and zero experience in the other . This would some - how correspond to claiming that analogical ability \u2013 and its effect on exaptive technological breakthroughs \u2013 equals zero in deep experience cases . However , some recent research has emphasized the dual dimension of technological breakthroughs\u2014as they may require bridging diverse knowledge domains as well as a deep knowledge of a particular knowledge domain ( see Ref . Kaplan and Vakili , 2014 ) . A general example is provided by how Ford borrowed the idea of the moving assembly line from the meatpacking indus - try in Chicago . Ford had deep experience in handcrafting a car ( in his garage ) but no experience at all in meatpacking . The example clearly shows that if we would rely on a product - based measure then we would qualify inventors such as Ford as having no analogy making abilities , whereas the example shows that deep experience in one domain can still enable analogical processes . Therefore , we opted towards a more generic count - based measure and at the same time we controlled for all those cases of deep experience ( see the \u2018concentration dummy\u2019 in the controls section ) . Overall , our measure is more speci\ufb01c than knowledge diversity measures in the sense that it only captures the accumulation of knowledge in the target and base domains , which is a condition for the emergence of cognitive mappings or analogies between these domains . More - over , in order to exclude other equally plausible mechanisms at the individual level , we introduce several controls such as knowledge diversity , past experience in more than two technological areas , inventive myopia ( see Section 3 . 2 . 5 ) . Inventors\u2019 data have several limitations , such as the lack of a unique identi\ufb01cation of inventors due to name ambiguity on patent records , and eventual missing data due to randomness of disambiguation algorithms ( Lai et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we dropped those cases in which the citing patent had no inventor identi\ufb01cation , and controlled for those cases in which the citing patent had one or more inventors with no previous patents . 1426 M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 Fig . 2 . Illustration of the magnetron , of the microwave , and of their patents . 3 . 2 . 4 . Patent scope We introduced the number of patent claims as a proxy of patent scope . A patent includes a set of claims , where the principal claim describes the essential characteristics of the invention while the subordinate claims de\ufb01ne more detailed characteristics or alter - native hypothetical \u2018embodiments\u2019 of the invention . As argued by Lanjouw and Schankerman , ( 2001 ) , patent claims de\ufb01ne the scope of legal protection of a technology . As noted by Merges and Nelson ( 1990 ) , they form a protective line around the patent that delim - its inventors\u2019 intellectual property from the surrounding terrain of technological possibilities . This interpretation is particularly valid in patent - law systems known as \u2018peripheral\u2019 ( US , UK , and Japan ) : in those systems the entire set of claims \u2018exactly\u2019 de\ufb01nes the \u2018fence\u2019 of protection ( Fromer , 2009 ) . In patent - law systems known as \u2018cen - tral\u2019 ( Germany and continental Europe ) , on the other hand , only few embodiments de\ufb01ne protection , and those are used to determine whether potentially infringing items are \u2018similar enough\u2019 to them . It is important to note that the patent applicant usually has an incen - tive to claim as much as possible , although the patent examiner may require the number of claims to be narrowed before granting ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 2001 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . Control variables We introduced several controls in order to rule out unobserved factors that may be correlated with technological complexity and , at the same time , with exaptation ( see also Refs . Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ; Fleming , 2001 ; Singh and Fleming , 2010 ; Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 1 . Inventors\u2019 generic experience . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because the inventor that builds on the patent has less prior generic experience . We used , as a proxy of generic experience , the number of previous patents of the inventor ( or team ) of the \ufb01rst patent that cites the focal patent i ( Singh and Fleming , 2010 ) . Previous patents belong to a 15 - year pre - sample window ( 1975 \u2013 1990 interval ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 2 . Inventors\u2019 diversity of experience . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because the inventor ( or team ) has less prior experience with differ - ent technological areas . We used , as a proxy of experience diversity , the number of technological classes in which the inventor ( or team ) of patent i had previous patents ( Singh and Fleming , 2010 ) . Previous patents belong to a 15 - year pre - sample window . M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 1427 3 . 2 . 5 . 3 . Inventors\u2019 team dummy . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because the inven - tor that builds on the patent is working alone and has no access to creative collaboration . We controlled for those cases in which the inventors of the \ufb01rst citing patent belong to a team . 3 . 2 . 5 . 4 . Inventors\u2019 team size . Adopting a similar logic , we also con - trolled for the size of the team . 3 . 2 . 5 . 5 . Concentration dummy . As mentioned above ( see analogy measure ) , we controlled for those cases in which the inventor ( or team ) belonging to the \ufb01rst citing patent had previous patents all concentrated in the OR class of either the cited patent or the citing patent . 3 . 2 . 5 . 6 . Inventors\u2019 control . As mentioned above , we also controlled for those cases in which the \ufb01rst citing patent had one or more inventors with no previous patents . 3 . 2 . 5 . 7 . Combination familiarity . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because the inven - tor ( or team ) that builds on the patent has excessive familiarity with its con\ufb01guration of components and remains trapped in local search ( March 1991 ) . In order to measure familiarity with the con - \ufb01guration of components of patent i , we measured the average time proximity of patent i to previous patents having an identical con - \ufb01guration of patent subclasses ( Fleming , 2001 ) . Previous patents belong to a 15 - year pre - sample window . 3 . 2 . 5 . 8 . Number of subclasses . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because the inven - tor ( or team ) that builds on the patent has to deal with its excessive number of components , and this may represent a cognitive bound . We used the number of patent subclasses as a proxy for the number of components ( Fleming , 2001 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 9 . Single subclass dummy . Several patents in our sample have only one subclass\u2014around 7 % . As the technological complexity measure is not able to capture interdependencies for those patents , we controlled for them ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 10 . Number of prior art citations . A patent may be less exap - tive not because of greater technological complexity , but because it is characterized by higher technological maturity that limits the exploration of exaptive recon\ufb01gurations . We used the number of backward citations as a proxy of technological maturity ( Ziedonis , 2007 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 11 . Scienti\ufb01c references . A patent may be less exaptive not because of greater technological complexity , but because it is char - acterized by lower levels of generality . We used the number of non - patent references ( e . g . to scienti\ufb01c journals ) as a proxy of gen - erality . Moreover , non - patent references are also an indirect proxy of technological maturity , as patents with more scienti\ufb01c refer - ences tend to protect early - stage inventions ( Narin et al . , 1997 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 12 . Technology control . We controlled for the average number of citations received by previous patents in the same technological class of patent i , in order to remove systematic sources of varia - tion in the citation process that may affect our dependent variable ( Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) ) . If patent i falls into different tech - nological classes , we also included those classes in the calculation , as in Ref . Fleming and Sorenson ( 2001 ) . 3 . 2 . 5 . 13 . Number of classes . We included this variable because a patent that falls into a broad range of technological classes is more likely to be cited by future patents , and this may affect the denom - inator of our dependent variable ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . Similarly , a patent that falls into a broad range of technological classes is more likely to be cited by patents that also fall into dif - ferent technological classes . This may affect the numerator of our dependent variable . 3 . 2 . 5 . 14 . Diversity of patent portfolio . In order to test the \ufb01fth hypothesis , we looked at how much \u2018cross - \ufb01rm\u2019 forward citations spread across different technological classes . We wanted to rule out those factors that may depend on the propensity of \ufb01rms\u2019 patent portfolios to cite patents belonging to different technologi - cal classes . We therefore used pre - sample information to measure \ufb01rm characteristics . According to Blundell et al . ( 1995 ) , this means including variables that approximate the accumulation of a \ufb01rm\u2019s technological knowledge and it may constitute an approxima - tion of unobservable factors . For each forward citation received by the focal patent i , we calculated the technological diversity of the patent portfolio belonging to the citing patent\u2019s \ufb01rm . We then calculated average technological diversity across all forward citations and introduced it as a control . In order to calculate tech - nological diversity , we computed a Her\ufb01ndahl index of dispersion across technological classes of the \ufb01rm\u2019s previous patents . We also controlled for the technological diversity of the patent portfolio belonging to the \ufb01rm of the focal patent i . We considered a 10 - year pre - sample window in order to calculate these measures . 3 . 2 . 5 . 15 . Size of patent portfolio . Adopting a similar logic , we con - trolled for the average size of the patent portfolio belonging to the citing patents\u2019 \ufb01rms , and for the size of the patent portfolio belonging to the \ufb01rm of the focal patent i . 3 . 2 . 5 . 16 .

We introduced technolog - ical class \ufb01xed effects to remove systematic sources of variation in the citation process that may take place across technological classes and be missed by the \u2018technology control\u2019 . 3 . 2 . 5 . 17 . Application year and citing year \ufb01xed effects . We controlled for the application year of the focal patent and for the applica - tion years of the \ufb01rst and last citing patents to remove systematic sources of variation in the citing process that may take place over time . While , at \ufb01rst sight , citing year \ufb01xed effects may appear endogenous to the exaptation process , they have been recently adopted for the econometric identi\ufb01cation of the age pro\ufb01le of patent citations ( see Ref . Mehta et al . , 2010 ) . As noted by Mehta et al . ( 2010 : 1180 ) , \u2018controlling for the birth year of the citing patent ( de\ufb01ned as \u201ccalendar effect\u201d ) is important because patents have received more citations in recent years , re\ufb02ecting an overall increase in patenting\u2019 . As double - check , we removed citing year \ufb01xed effects from some models speci\ufb01cations and the main results did not change substantially . 15 3 . 2 . 5 . 18 . Grant month \ufb01xed effects . We introduced grant month \ufb01xed effects to rule out eventual truncation issues due to the fact that a patent granted in January 1991 will systematically receive more citations than a patent granted in June 1991 . 15 See models I and II in the robustness checks table . 1428 M .

Results As our dependent variable is a proportion , we adopted the fractional logit estimation procedure proposed by Papke and Wooldridge ( 1996 ) . Table 1 presents descriptive statistics . Mean values and standard deviations are consistent with pre - vious studies ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ; Fleming , 2001 ; Singh and Fleming , 2010 ) . As we can notice , inventor - level variables such as analogical ability seem to be characterized by a skewed distribu - tion ( see Ref . Singh and Fleming , 2010 for similar evidence ) . Table 2 presents bivariate correlations . Correlation values are generally low , except for inventors\u2019 team size and inventors\u2019 team dummy and for the number of subclasses and the number of classes . Table 3 - A presents the results of our estimation for the \ufb01rst hypothesis . Model 1 reports the baseline model with control vari - ables . Model 2 adds technological complexity and Model 3 adds the squared term of technological complexity . Model 4 shows the full model . Model 5 demonstrates that the main results are insensitive to the inclusion of controls . The coef\ufb01cient of technological complexity is positive and sig - ni\ufb01cant ( Model 4 ) . Moreover , the squared term of technological complexity is negative and signi\ufb01cant . The result con\ufb01rms our \ufb01rst hypothesis ( H1 ) that the relationship between technological com - plexity and exaptive innovation can be described by an inverted U - shaped function . Table 3 - B presents the results of our estimation for the second ( H2 ) and third ( H3 ) hypotheses . Model 1 reports the baseline model with control variables . Model 2 adds techno - logical complexity and its squared term , and Model 3 adds the inventors\u2019 analogical ability . Model 4 adds the interaction terms of the inventors\u2019 analogical ability with technological complexity and its squared term . Model 5 shows the full model . Inventors\u2019 analog - ical ability is positive and signi\ufb01cant ( Model 5 ) , supporting H2 that analogical ability positively affects exaptive innovation . However , the interaction terms are not signi\ufb01cant ; this \ufb01nding does not sup - port H3 . Table 3 - C presents the results of our estimation for the fourth ( H4 ) and \ufb01fth ( H5 ) hypotheses that patent scope blocks the exaptive technological developments of inventors at other \ufb01rms . For these hypotheses the sample size decreased smaller \u2013 4685 patents \u2013 because of the following reason : the assignees of several patents of the original sample are not \ufb01rms and therefore a unique PDPCO identi\ufb01er does not exist for them . In other words , several patents of the original sample did not belong to \ufb01rms and they had to be excluded in order to build the measure for hypotheses H4 and H5 . Model 1 reports the baseline model with control variables . Model 2 adds technological complexity and its squared term and Model 3 adds patent scope . Model 4 adds the interaction terms of patent scope with technological complexity and its squared term . Model 5 shows the full model . Patent scope is positive and signi\ufb01 - cant ( Model 5 ) , in contrast with H4 that asserted that it negatively affects exaptive innovation . Moreover , the interaction terms are not signi\ufb01cant , which does not support H5 . In Model I and II of Table 4 we report the results of a different set of analyses based on a case - control design as explained right after . In Models 1 \u2013 5 of the same Table we check the robustness of our main hypothesis H1 under alternative speci\ufb01cations based on exaptation measures that capture jumps in more distant cate - gories ( based on the NBER aggregation of classes of Hall et al . , 2001 ) , as well as under Ols and Tobit speci\ufb01cations and a fractional logit speci\ufb01cation with de - mean complexity . 16 4 . 1 . Case - control design Our current approach , based on the aggregation of citing patents into a single measure , precludes the possibility to control for the heterogeneity of citing patents and , therefore , of future inventors . This may explain the lack of support of hypotheses such as H3 . Therefore , as in Ref . Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) , we introduced a case - control design in order to better control for the heterogeneous attributes of future inventors and avoid the potential biases that may result from aggregating them into a single measure . Our new analysis treated the focal patent - citing patent dyad as the unit of analysis rather than the focal patent as before . Our case - control procedure worked as follows . First , we started from our initial sample of patents granted between January and June 1991 and identi\ufb01ed those 12334 focal patents that received at least one non - anticipated cross - class citation as explained above\u2014that is , we considered those focal patents that received citations from OR classes that differ from both the OR and XR classes of the focal patent itself ( we considered the 1991 \u2013 1999 window for citations ) . Second , we built the dyads by pairing the focal patent with each cross - class citation and set the dependent variable equal to 1 for these realized dyads . Third , we paired the focal patent with three future citations that did not cite the focal patent but that could have cited it , since these citations also cite patents belonging to differ - ent technological classes . We therefore set the dependent variable equal to 0 for these unrealized dyads of the control group . 17 We chose three citations for the control group so that the sample would have a similar proportion of realized and unrealized dyads , since a focal patent receives three cross - class citations on average . Over - all , the sample contains a total of 77166 realized and unrealized dyads . As our dependent variable has a value of 1 or 0 for realized and unrealized dyads respectively , we adopted logistic regression . However , the use of a case - control design usually introduces new problems such as biased estimates of the logistic regression due to lack of independence across repeated observations due to the repeated entry of focal patents in the data . As in Ref . Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) , we adopted a correction method for logistic regression with robust standard using the Relogit Stata toolbox . We refer the reader to Refs . Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) and King and Zeng ( 2001 ) for further details . 16 An Appendix with a more detailed explication of robustness checks and econo - metric speci\ufb01cation is available upon request from the authors . 17 As in Ref . Sorenson et al . ( 2006 ) , we chose these citations at random rather than matching cases and controls on the basis of several dimensions that may be potentially endogenous . M . Mastrogiorgio , V .

First , the signi\ufb01cant and positive sign of complexity coupled with the signi\ufb01cant and negative sign of its squared term con\ufb01rms the previous results and , again , provides support for our \ufb01rst hypothesis . Second , the signi\ufb01cant and positive sign of analogical ability con\ufb01rms the second hypothesis . Moreover , the signi\ufb01cant and positive sign of complexity * analogical abil - ity coupled with the signi\ufb01cant and negative sign of complexity\u02c62 * analogical ability provides new evidence in support of the third hypothesis . Regarding patent scope , its signi\ufb01cant and positive sign is again in contrast with the fourth hypothesis . Similarly , the sign of complexity\u02c62 * patent scope is not signi\ufb01cant and in contrast with the \ufb01fth hypothesis . 18 , 19 Due to the non - linearity of logistic regres - sion \u2013 which requires assumptions about all other variables in the model \u2013 we report the result of a linear probability model in Model II of Table 4 ( second column ) . 20 Again , the signi\ufb01cant and positive sign of complexity coupled with the signi\ufb01cant and negative sign of the squared term provide support for our \ufb01rst hypothesis . In order to con\ufb01rm our main result , we also run a statistical test of the inverse U - shaped relationship based on the framework devel - oped by Sasabuchi ( 1980 ) and the Stata routine later introduced by Lind and Mehlum ( 2007 ) . As noted by Lind and Mehlum ( 2007 ) , the criteria of only adding a squared term and testing its signi\ufb01 - cance could be weak in those cases in which the true relationship is convex but not inverse U - shaped . Their procedure is based on testing whether the slope of the curve is positive at the start and negative at the end of the range of variation of x values . Moreover , it provides the x value that maximizes the inverse U - shaped curve . With a p - value lower than 0 . 01 , the test rejected the null hypothesis of a monotone or U - shaped relationship and therefore supported our main hypothesis of an inverse U - shaped curve . Moreover , the 18 As the dependent variable has a binary nature rather than being based on citation counts , the technology - control was removed from Model I . Moreover , we introduced \ufb01xed effects for technological categories based on the NBER aggregation of techno - logical classes in six broad categories . Due to the highly skewed nature of analogical ability , results in Model I are based on a logarithmic transformation of analogical ability in the interactions . Following the suggestion of a reviewer , we also removed citation \ufb01xed effects . 19 We also run the results using an alternative measure of analogical ability based on the product rather than the count of inventors\u2019 historical patents in the OR classes of the focal and citing patents respectively ( see Section 3 . 2 . 3 ) . The rationale is that an inventor could have a high value on the sum by simply having deep experience in either the class of the focal patent or the class of the citing patent . Estimates are not reported here and they are available from the \ufb01rst author . Therefore , we used a sum - based measure of analogical ability in all models and controlled for all cases of deep experience ( see \u2018concentration dummy\u2019 ) . 20 We thank one of the reviewers for the suggestion . 0 0 , 1 0 , 2 0 , 3 0 , 4 0 , 5 0 , 6 0 , 7 0 , 8 0 , 9 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 C r o ss - c l a ss - c i t a t i on p r ob a b ili t y Techno logical Complexi ty 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 C r o ss - c l a ss - c i t a t i on p r ob a b ili t y m u l t i p li e r Techno logical Complexi ty Fig . 3 .

The signi\ufb01cant - positive sign of analogy coupled with the signi\ufb01cant - positive and negative signs of the interactions provide support for our second and third hypotheses respectively . Linear probability models also make it easier to analyze effect sizes . As complexity increases from 0 to 1 , the probability of an unexpected cross - class forward citation grows by 4 . 08 % . Fig . 3 simulates the main effect and reveals that , as complexity increases from 0 to its in\ufb02ection point 10 , the probability grows by almost 20 % and then decreases consistently with H1 : this suggests that the nega - tive effect of complexity only manifests itself at high levels above the average ( of 0 . 67 ) .

However , a less pronounced effect seems to suggest that analogical ability is more powerful in low versus high complexity settings .

Discussion , implications and conclusions Overall , our \ufb01ndings show that the creation potential for exap - tive innovations is correlated to three main conditions . A \ufb01rst condition is the degree of technological complexity . The curvilinear effect of technological complexity implies that , to the extent that technological interdependencies between components increase , the exaptation potential is observed to go up . However , our \ufb01nd - ings also indicate that this works only up to a point , because when complexity becomes too high , the exaptation potential is observed to diminish . Overall , our results show that our main hypothesis of the curvilinear relationship between technological complexity and exaptation is con\ufb01rmed . A second condition is the degree of ana - logical ability\u2014i . e . the cognitive ability of certain inventors to see commonalities between seemingly unrelated domains . Inventors\u2019 analogical ability is positively correlated to exaptive innovation . These results are consistent with the general argument that anal - ogy making plays a central role during the process of invention ( Hargadon and Sutton , 1997 ) . More speci\ufb01cally , these results res - onate with the argument that exaptive events are produced by cognitive processes which consist in establishing relations \u2013 or mappings \u2013 among different problem domains ( Furnari , 2011 ) . However \u2013 with the exception of the case - control design spec - i\ufb01cations \u2013 we could not \ufb01nd clear statistical support for our hypothesis that inventors\u2019 analogical ability positively moderates the relationship between technological complexity and exaptive innovation . This result is puzzling , because it suggests that the prior knowledge owned by inventors is positively correlated to exaptive innovation but not because it helps them to arrive at a richer representation of the architecture of the inventive problem and to better process complex interdependencies ( Gavetti et al . , 2005 ) . As argued by Gavetti et al . ( 2005 ) , we believe that this link - age between inventors\u2019 analogical ability and the architecture of the inventive problem is a crucial aspect that future studies should explore more carefully . Also , we could not \ufb01nd statistical support for our hypotheses that patent scope has a direct and moder - ating effect on exaptive innovation . This result is surprising but not puzzling , and may be explained as follows . If patent scope is larger , inventors may experience a stronger incentive to look for new application domains that fall beyond the claims speci\ufb01ed in the patent . While larger patent scope may indeed block innova - tions that fall within the scope claimed by the focal patent , at the same time it may stimulate innovations that fall beyond this scope . This seems to suggest that patent scope blocks more incre - 21 The differences between predicted probabilities for given intervals of complex - ity re\ufb02ect the estimated coef\ufb01cient of complexity for those intervals and can be thus used to enhance the representation of non - monothonic effects . Calculations and plots \u2013 obtained through Stata post - estimation procedures called \u2018margins\u2019 and \u2018marginsplot\u2019 \u2013 are not reported and they are available upon request from the authors . mental innovations but might stimulate exaptive innovations that may form precursors of more radical innovations . This is consistent with some recent studies that contradict the widespread argument that patent scope blocks downstream technological developments . For example , Katznelson and Howells ( 2012 ) have analysed the activity directed at \u2018designing - around\u2019 Edison\u2019s patent of the incan - descent lamp . They have demonstrated that the legal enforcement of Edison\u2019s patent stimulated several downstream developments of major technological importance , some of which were directed to design around Claim 2 of Edison\u2019s patent ( the hardest claim to circumvent at the time ) . We suggest this as an issue for future research . Although we cannot establish relationships of the causal type , our results point to a number of practical implications both for \ufb01rms and for policy makers . A \ufb01rst implication is that , to the extent that \ufb01rms want to stimulate the potential for exaptive innovations , it becomes critical to measure the degree of complexity of the tech - nologies in their portfolio as complexity in\ufb02uences the potential for successful exaptation . For instance , our results suggest that R & D managers should measure the degree of complexity of the patents in their portfolio . Then they should calibrate the patent portfolio \u2013 e . g . through patent acquisitions or divestitures \u2013 in a way that it contains patents whose average complexity is around the optimal value of 10 . This would increase the portfolio - level potential for exaptation and , more importantly , it could have positive indirect consequences such as increasing revenues in case the \ufb01rm plans to sell or out - license the patents . Our results also provide an indica - tion of the level of complexity that engineers should target , as they search for an optimal level of modularization that increases the potential for exaptative innovations . A second implication is that increasing the potential for an innovation through exaptation will not so much follow from spending more on R & D nor from inten - sifying current technological search efforts . The effect of inventor analogy making indicates that exaptation stems from different cog - nitive processes when compared to adaptive innovation , and they reveal the fallacies of dominant mindsets and strongly held beliefs such as industry recipes ( Spender , 1989 ) . Hence , the fundamental point is that exaptations are less likely to originate from in - depth technological expertise , but instead from what could be more gen - erally quali\ufb01ed as \u2018analogy making ability\u2019 . Typically for \ufb01rms with deep expertise in their core business activities is that they rely on in - depth experts who think within their deep pockets of expertise , whereas they simply forget looking \u2018to the side\u2019 and see what has already been invented or where new application domains reside for their current expertise and technology . In addition , this risk may not only rest within R & D and with its specialists but also at higher echelons within \ufb01rms . A case in point is formed by Polaroid that was the \ufb01rst company to develop a digital camera in its R & D labs . However , senior management quali\ufb01ed this as a failure because it did not recognize its potential for application in new domains and the creation of new markets . Instead , they clang to their exist - ing business model that prescribed revenues to come from selling \ufb01lm rather than from selling ( new ) hardware , which ultimately led to their demise in the early 1990s . So the key implication for \ufb01rms is that , to address this risk of limited analogy making abil - ity , boosting their innovation performance may also come from challenging established beliefs and dominant cognitions that may serve as a formidable barrier to exaptive innovation . To address this risk , \ufb01rms can take several measures . One is that \ufb01rms should cherish the mavericks in their organizations to the extent that they carry the ability to see things or opportunities well before any - one else does . A second one is to systematically hire people from other industries who can see opportunities for application in their industry of origin much sooner and will be better quali\ufb01ed to assess their attractiveness . A third measure is formed by engaging in sys - tematic inter - sectoral collaboration rather than in intra - sectoral 1434 M . Mastrogiorgio , V . Gilsing / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 1419 \u2013 1435 collaboration . Whereas inter - sectoral collaboration comes at a ( ini - tial ) price of overcoming a larger cognitive distance with the involved partner ( s ) , it also carries the potential of yielding innova - tions with much higher novelty value , once cognitive distance has been overcome ( Nooteboom et al . , 2007 ; Gilsing et al . , 2008 ) . What these three measures share is their common emphasis on nurtur - ing a sense of \u2018cognitive openness\u2019 that contributes to the ability of analogy making . For policy makers , the implication is that a classi - cal instrument in their tool - box formed by stimulating private R & D through \ufb01scal measures is especially relevant for the more main - stream , \u2018classical\u2019 recombination process formed by technological search activities in view of adaptation . However , to stimulate inno - vation and renewal in an economy through the alternative process of exaptation , it is critical to stimulate cognitive openness by \ufb01rms . Policy makers can enhance this by ensuring , among others , an easy and free \ufb02ow of people across different industries ( e . g . limiting anti - competition clauses in labor contracts ) , but also through reduction or elimination of barriers for foreign knowledge workers for entry . In addition , a risk that policy makers should be aware of is that they are being exposed to lobbying through players from estab - lished industries with vested interests in maintaining the status quo ( Aldrich and Fiol , 1994 ) . This is typically how established play - ers respond to disruptive technologies and innovations , instead of by changing the focus and speed of their own innovation activi - ties . Instead , they tend to rely on \u2018regulatory capture\u2019 formed by lobbying and in\ufb02uencing policy makers in order to maintain the status quo and withstand the possible disruption of their indus - try , through an exaptative innovation from elsewhere . Hence , an awareness of this risk and a similar degree of cognitive openness may be critical for policy makers to stimulate innovation through exaptation in the economy . Our paper has several limitations . First , our main empirical set - ting was based on a cross - sectional sample of patents . In order to rule out eventual unobserved heterogeneity , the identi\ufb01cation strategy proposed by Mehta et al . ( 2010 ) \u2013 which is based on the exploitation of the patent grant lag as a source of exogenous variation \u2013 may represent a starting point for future studies that will adopt a similar empirical setting . Second , our novel mea - sure may be coarse in the sense that \u2013 besides exaptations \u2013 it may capture a subset of functional shifts that are due to differ - ent technological characteristics such as \u2018generality\u2019 . Although our measure differs from generality ( see Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) and we con - trol for it ( see Section 3 . 2 . 5 ) , there is still room for improvement . We leave this to future research . Overall , cross - class forward cita - tions are systematic ( Ghiglino and Kuschy , 2010 ) and they may re\ufb02ect the pervasivity of technological exaptation ( Dew et al . , 2004 ; Kauffmann , 2000 ) . Third , our empirical setting was based on patent data , which are characterized by several shortcomings . The accuracy of patent measures can vary signi\ufb01cantly across technolo - gies . For instance , patent subclasses may not always correspond to underlying technological components ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2001 ) . Future research should explore these measurement issues more deeply . Fourth , complementary explanations of our main results should be also considered . For instance , some results in Table 3 - C such as a stronger effect of the squared term seem to suggest that inventors of different versus focal \ufb01rms are more sub - ject to the negative impact of high level of complexity . This may be due to lower communication advantages \u2013 and lower \ufb02ows of use - ful information \u2013 due to lower social proximity to the inventors of the focal \ufb01rm ( see Ref . Sorenson et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , some results in Table 3 - C suggest that , when patent scope increases , inventors of different versus focal \ufb01rms experience a stronger \u2018incentive\u2019 to look for new application domains that fall beyond the claims speci\ufb01ed in the patent , and this may stimulate exaptive innovation . Alterna - tive explanations should not be ruled out , such as lower cognitive barriers due to organizational differences . Future research should explore these issues more deeply . Despite these limitations , our paper offers several contribu - tions . First , our \ufb01ndings contribute to the general debate on the emergence of radical innovations \u2013 and on variety creation in the economy \u2013 by further illuminating the role played by exap - tive mechanisms . In this regard , we shed light on the existence of underlying \u2018systematic\u2019 conditions that foster exaptive mech - anisms . Second , our empirical results shed light on a number of speci\ufb01c theoretical arguments that have been made very recently in the exaptation literature , in particular that literature that has analysed the role of exaptation and modularization ( Andriani and Carignani , 2014 ) . Third , our paper brings new insights into the broad debate on technological evolution and evolutionary analo - gies ( Arthur , 2009 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . Fourth , our \ufb01ndings contribute to the debate on how innovation is shaped by exap - tive and adaptive mechanisms . The concept of \u2018exaptation\u2019 , which implies a sudden functional shift of a technology , has been intro - duced to make a distinction from the concept of \u2018adaptation\u2019 , which implies a gradual process driven by selective pressures . The conditions that lead to adaptation have been analysed in a com - prehensive manner : see Fleming and Sorenson\u2019s \u2018Technology as a Complex Adaptive System \u2019 ( 2001 ) . Our paper adopts a similar empirical framework in order to \ufb01ll a gap and explore the conditions of exaptive mechanisms that foster new innovations . .
